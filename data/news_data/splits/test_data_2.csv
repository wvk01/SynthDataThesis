"U.N. rights boss sees possible ""crimes against humanity"" in Venezuela","GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that Venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation. But Venezuela s foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as  baseless . Venezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship.  My investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,  Zeid Ra ad al Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. He said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. Last month, Zeid s office said Venezuela s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti-government protests and that democracy was  barely alive .  There is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,  Zeid said. The opposition, which boycotted the election for the Constituent Assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. However, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Geneva forum:  We have now selected the National Constituent Assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens  will. It will have the powers to draw up a new Constitution.    The opposition in Venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,  he said. Arreaza accused protesters of using firearms and  home-made weapons  against security forces, but noted that the last death was on July 30.  Our country is now at peace,  he added. Venezuela is among the 47 members of the Council, where it enjoys strong support from Cuba, Iran and other states. Diego Arria, who was Venezuela s ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1991 to 1994, told a separate Geneva event organized by activists and action group UN Watch that Venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.  I am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,  he said. The Hague-based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  Julieta Lopez, aunt of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued.  There is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,  she told the same event. ",worldnews,"September 11, 2017 ",1,3043

Vatican prepared in case of Barcelona-style attack: Swiss Guard chief,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - It is perhaps  only a matter of time  before Rome is hit by a Barcelona-style attack but security forces are ready in case the Vatican is targeted, the head the Swiss Guard has said. Security has been stepped up at religious sites throughout Italy, including at the Vatican, since last year, when a truck driven by a suspected Islamist militant killed 86 people in the French city of Nice. Barriers and police and army vehicles have been placed around St. Peter s Basilica to make it harder for a vehicle to gather speed in an attack such as the one last week in Barcelona, which killed 13 people. Despite threats from Islamic State, Rome and other Italian cities have so far been spared the kind of vehicle attacks that have also hit Nice, London, and Berlin.  It could perhaps be just a matter of time before there is such an attack in Rome, but we are prepared,  Christoph Graf, the commandant of the Swiss Guard, was quoted as telling the Swiss Catholic website Cath.ch. Graf, referring to the attack in Barcelona, spoke on the sidelines of a religious ceremony in the Swiss city of Solothurn earlier this week. Websites linked to Islamic State militants have made threats against Catholic targets in Rome in recent years. In 2015 in a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya, one of the killers said:  Safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for ... We will conquer Rome, by the will of Allah.  At about the same time a website used by militants ran a photo montage showing the movement s black flag flying from the obelisk at the center of St Peter s Square. The Swiss Guard has its origins as a papal protection force in the 16th century and numbers about 110 men, all of Swiss nationality. It shares responsibility for the protection of the pope and the Vatican with a police force of about the same size. Italian police are responsible for patrolling the Vatican s external perimeter in Rome. Both Vatican security forces are trained in anti-terrorism tactics and in the use of modern weapons.

Italy holds funeral for 26 Nigerian women drowned in Mediterranean,"SALERNO, Italy (Reuters) - Italy held a mass funeral on Friday for 26 young Nigerian women who drowned while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. A Roman Catholic bishop and a Muslim imam both said prayers at the simple ceremony in the southern city of Salerno, with 26 wooden coffins laid out on a stone dais. A single white rose was placed on the lid of each. Just two of the women were identified.  It is very likely that these girls were victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation,  said Federico Soda, director UN migration agency IOM for the Mediterranean. A recent IOM report had estimated that 80 percent of Nigerian girls arriving in Italy by sea might be trafficking victims. The 26 bodies were retrieved from the sea on Nov. 3 by a Spanish rescue ship, while some 64 people were unaccounted for and feared lost, bringing the total dead to around 90, said Flavio Di Giacomo, an IOM spokesman. Survivors found on nearby rubber boats said the women were all Nigerian and had left Libya hoping to make it to Italy. The only two identified were named as Marian Shaka, who was married, and Osato Osaro. Both were pregnant. Some of those who died were believed to have been as young as 14. Almost 115,000 migrants, mainly African men, have reached Italy so far this year, according to government data released on Friday, against just over 167,000 in the same period last year. IOM said at least 2,925 people died trying to cross the Mediterranean from Jan 1.-Nov. 5 against 4,302 last year. The Italian government has worked with Libyan authorities to block migrants from leaving the north African state, leading to a sharp fall in new arrivals since the summer. The government says its policy has cut the number of sea deaths, while critics say it has left thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in appalling conditions in Libya.

Obama says Trump's comments on women disqualifying,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s comments on a 2005 videotape about groping women would disqualify him from even a job at a convenience store.     Speaking at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama said the choice was clear in the Nov. 8 election even before the tape was leaked last week showing Trump speaking crudely about women. “Now you find a situation in which the guy says stuff that nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,” Obama told the crowd, referring to the convenience store chain.  Trump said during Sunday night’s presidential debate he was embarrassed by the video, but dismissed it as “locker room talk.” Obama also criticized some Republicans who have condemned the remarks but are still backing the New York businessman. “The fact that now you’ve got people saying: ‘We strongly disagree, we really disapprove ... but we’re still endorsing him.’ They still think he should be president, that doesn’t make sense to me,” Obama said. Earlier on Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the remarks in the recording amounted to sexual assault.  Obama also took aim at Trump’s business credentials,  referring to a New York Times report that showed he claimed a nearly billion dollar loss in one year on his taxes in the 1990s. “They say the house always wins,” Obama quipped about Trump, who was a casino developer at the time. “I don’t know how that happens.”  ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1,1625
Russian hacker wanted by U.S. tells court he worked for Putin's party,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian hacker arrested in Spain on a U.S. warrant said on Thursday he previously worked for President Vladimir Putin s United Russia party and feared he would be tortured and killed if extradited, RIA news agency reported. Peter Levashov was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona in April. U.S. prosecutors later charged him with hacking offences, accusing him of operating a network of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals. Levashov s comments offered a rare glimpse into the relationship between cyber criminals and the Russian state. U.S. officials say Russian authorities routinely shield hackers from prosecution abroad before recruiting them for espionage work. Russian hackers have been under intense scrutiny since U.S. intelligence officials accused Moscow of interfering in last year s U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.   U.S. prosecutors are seeking a 52-year jail sentence and Levashov, who denies the charges against him, is fighting his extradition from Spain. He told a court in Madrid on Thursday that he had worked for the United Russia party for the last 10 years.  I collected different information about opposition parties and delivered it to the necessary people at the necessary time,  RIA quoted him as saying. Levashov provided no further details about his work for the party, RIA reported, though said he was an officer in the Russian army with access to classified information.  It was unclear if Levashov was a serving officer or an army reservist having completed mandatory military service.  He also told the court investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges against him.  If I go to the U.S., I will die in a year. They want to get information of a military nature and about the United Russia party,  RIA quoted him as saying.  I will be tortured, within a year I will be killed, or I will kill myself.  Levashov has long been seen by cyber security investigators to be the person behind an online persona known as Peter Severa. Severa spent years listed among the world s 10 most prolific spammers, according to spam-tracking group Spamhaus. U.S. prosecutors have accused Levashov of running the infamous Kelihos botnet, a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses, ransomware, phishing emails and other spam attacks. Russia lodged its own request for Levashov s extradition last week, RIA reported. ",worldnews,"September 28, 2017 ",1,2636
JUST IN: FBI Supervisor Fired For Anti-Trump Texts Oversaw Michael Flynn Interviews,"A supervisory special agent who is now under scrutiny after being removed from Robert Mueller s Special Counsel s Office for alleged bias against President Trump also oversaw the bureau s interviews of embattled former National Security advisor Michael Flynn, this reporter has learned. Flynn recently pled guilty to one-count of lying to the FBI last week.FBI agent Peter Strzok was one of two FBI agents who interviewed Flynn, which took place on Jan. 24, at the White House, said several sources. The other FBI special agent, who interviewed Flynn, is described by sources as a field supervisor in the  Russian Squad, at the FBI s Washington Field Office,  according to a former intelligence official, with knowledge of the interview.Strzok was removed from his role in the Special Counsel s Office after it was discovered he had made disparaging comments about President Trump in text messages between him and his alleged lover FBI attorney Lisa Page, according to the New York Times and Washington Post, which first reported the stories. Strzok is also under investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General for his role in Hillary Clinton s email server and the ongoing investigation into Russia s election meddling. On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee s Chairman Devin Nunes chided the Justice Department and the FBI for not disclosing why Strzok had been removed from the Special Counsel three months ago, according to a statement given by the Chairman.The former U.S. intelligence official told this reporter,  with the recent revelation that Strzok was removed from the Special Counsel investigation for making anti-Trump text messages it seems likely that the accuracy and veracity of the 302 of Flynn s interview as a whole should be reviewed and called into question. The most logical thing to happen would be to call the other FBI Special Agent present during Flynn s interview before the Grand Jury to recount his version,  the former intelligence official added.The former official also said that  Strzok s allegiance to (Deputy Director Andrew) McCabe was unwavering and very well known. Flynn, a retired three-star general, issued a statement on Dec. 1, saying,  it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of  treason  and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. According to another source, with direct knowledge of the Jan. 24 interview, McCabe had contacted Flynn by phone directly at the White House. White House officials had spent the  earlier part of the week with the FBI overseeing training and security measures associated with their new roles so it was no surprise to Flynn that McCabe had called,  the source said.McCabe told Flynn  some agents were heading over (to the White House) but Flynn thought it was part of the routine work the FBI had been doing and said they would be cleared at the gate,  the source said. It wasn t until after they were already in (Flynn s) office that he realized he was being formerly interviewed. He didn t have an attorney with him,  they added.Flynn s attorney Robert Kelner did not respond for comment. A former FBI agent said the investigation into Strzok and the reported text messages between him and Page, shows a  bias that cannot be ignored particularly if he had anything to do with Flynn s interview and his role in it. The former U.S. intelligence official questioned,  how logical is it that Flynn is being charged for lying to an agent whose character and neutrality was called into question by the Special Counsel. According to an anonymous source in The Washington Post, Strzok s and Page had exchanged a number of texts that  expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton.

 Fly Over Shows May 12 Gulf Oil Spill Far Worse Than Reported (VIDEO),"Shell admits to spilling 90,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico on May 12, 2016. Footage of the spill, captured by Ecogig Scientist Dr. Ian MacDonald during a fly over of the site, shows that the company has vastly misrepresented the size and magnitude of the spill.According to MacDonald, the spill covers more than five square nautical miles, the equivalent of 20 square kilometers, or about 5,000 acres.Maps, flight logs and other documentation regarding the aerial survey of the May 12 Gulf oil spill can be found here.MacDonald s survey of the deepwater spill found that the extent of the damage is not consistent with the company s stated figures.As MacDonald reports here:Even if the average thickness of the visible oil were a mere 100 micron (0.1 millimeter, vastly smaller than the areas of emulsified oil that stretch across the area), the visible surface oil would represent about 500,000 gallons of oil.MacDonald is with the nonprofit organization On Wings Of Care. The group has conducted hundreds of aerial surveys and logged thousands of flight-tracking hours since 2004, working in the Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean coast and many other areas.Referring to the recent Shell oil spill, which is located about 100 miles off the coast of Louisiana, MacDonald stressed the severity of what he observed, saying: We haven t seen images like this since the BP disaster of 2010.According to his report, which can be read here, the smell of oil was so strong that it was physically  uncomfortable  for the crew to fly closer than 1,000 feet above the spill.During the fly over MacDonald observed two small  clean-up  vessels.According to the report:There were two skimming vessels in the vicinity, but they appeared to be on the distant periphery of the slick, and the amount of oil that appeared to be within their booms was pitifully small compared to the size of the slick, which covered over 5 square nautical miles.On May 16, SkyTruth, a nonprofit environmental organization based in West-Virginia, blasted Shell s response to the spill calling it  a joke, but not a very funny joke,  writing:Thank you, Shell, for demonstrating quite convincingly over the past 4 days that oil spill cleanup is nothing more than a convenient fantasy.The organization also raised alarms about the shoddy monitoring of offshore drilling operations, noting that the recent spill was discovered entirely by accident.This spill was discovered accidentally by a helicopter pilot flying over the area who happened to spot the slick.  That s right: a modern pipeline at a high-tech deepwater development project leaked thousands of gallons of oil, and that leak was accidentally discovered.  Not because high-tech telemetry on the pipeline signaled an alarm due to a drop in pressure; not because flow metering detected a difference between what was going in one end of the pipe vs. what was coming out the other.  How long would this leak have continued, if not for the sheer luck of having a vigilant pilot happening by?Here s the disturbing footage from MacDonald s fly over of the spill.

U.S. citizen on the run after busting out of Bali prison,"DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian police are hunting for a U.S. citizen who escaped on Monday from an overcrowded prison on the holiday island of Bali by cutting through steel bars in a ceiling, the jail s second breakout of foreign inmates this year.  The Kerobokan prison, about 10 km (six miles) from the main tourist beaches in the Kuta area, often holds foreigners facing drug-related charges. Cristian Beasley, who was a suspect in crimes related to narcotics but had not been sentenced, escaped at 4.10 a.m. (2010 GMT Sunday), said Badung Police chief Yudith Satria Hananta.  It is thought that the prisoner escaped ... by cutting through the steel bars above the ceiling,  he said in a statement, without giving details of how Beasley escaped without being detected. Beasley, 32, from California, is believed to have then used a rope to climb down a wall before getting over a perimeter wall in an area being refurbished. Police had questioned witnesses and guards and were hunting for Beasley, Hananta said. Another American, Paul Anthony Hoffman, 57, was captured while also trying to escape, Hananta said. Representatives of Beasley and Hoffman could not immediately be reached for comment. In June, an Australian, a Bulgarian, an Indian and a Malaysian tunneled to freedom about 12 meters (13 yards) under the prison s walls. The Indian and the Bulgarian were caught soon after in neighboring East Timor, but Australian Shaun Edward Davidson and Malaysian Tee Kok King remain at large. Davidson has taunted authorities by saying he was enjoying life in various parts of the world, in purported posts on Facebook.  Kerobokan has housed a number of well-known foreign drug convicts, including Australian Schappelle Corby, whose 12-1/2-year sentence for marijuana smuggling got huge media attention. Indonesia has executed several foreign drug convicts in recent years. Indonesian prisons are often overcrowded, partly because a war on drugs led by the government of President Joko Widodo has led to a surge in the number of people locked up. As of June, Kerobokan housed 1,378 inmates, more than four times its planned capacity of 323, government data show. Prison escapes are fairly common in Indonesia, which launched an investigation this year after about 350 inmates broke out of a prison on the island of Sumatra.

" In HISTORY MAKING Kiss Cam Moment, Gay Couple Featured At NHL Game (VIDEO)","During nearly every sporting event, at one point in the game, the cameras are taken off the game to scan the crowd for loving couples to smooch each other on the infamous  Kiss Cam.

However, last year, a beautiful couple got caught on the Kiss Cam at Dodger stadium, and it looks as though another beautiful couple got their moment recently during a hockey game.In what is being reported as the first same-sex Kiss Cam moment in NHL history, Brad Parr and Andy Evans, while attending a Los Angeles Kings game at the Staples Center, were featured. The kiss drew huge cheers from the crowd.Parr told Outsports: It was a particularly sweet night since the Kings were playing and beat my hometown Toronto.

 Analysis Shows Hillary Clinton’s Plans Would Create Over 10 Million Jobs,"As the Democratic National Convention wrapped up its final night, with Hillary Clinton delivering a speech that blew Donald Trump out of the water, an independent analysis from Moody s Analytics shows Clinton s plans will create over 10.4 million new jobs over the span of 4 years   one full term as president.The analysis, when redone, showed a growth of 3.2 million more jobs than expected. Not only would the nation gain millions of new jobs (on top of the 15 million plus gained under President Obama), the GDP rate would accelerate, up-ticking from the 2.3 percent today to 2.7 percent by the end of Clinton s presidency.The analysis also pinpointed the exact proposals that would continue economic growth   immigration reform, infrastructure spending, and paid family leave.When we treat immigrants with respect, when we put people back to work on our roads and bridges, and when we allow parents time to take care of their children without losing their jobs, America will succeed.The positive analysis and prediction is due, in almost all part, thanks to a healthy and growing economy under President Obama, assuming it continues well into a possible Clinton presidency, or even if the world turns to hell again:The upshot of our analysis is that Secretary Clinton s economic policies when taken together will result in a stronger U.S. economy under almost any scenario.In other words: if the economy tanked in the last few months of Obama s presidency (like it did with President Bush), Clinton s plans would result in a rebound (just like Obama s presidency).Any way you look at it, good or bad, Clinton and her plans will be good for the economy.Last month, Moody s released their analysis about Trump s plans, and found his economic policies would cost the United States over 3.5 million jobs, and usher in an economic downturn worse (and longer) than the Great Recession. The massive job loss would cause the unemployment rate to jump to over 7 percent.America has their choice: the strongest economy since the 1940s or another Great Recession.Choose wisely.

" KY Gov. Matt Bevin Slashes Funding For Ethics Investigations, Elections Oversight","Kentucky governor Matt Bevin recently introduced a budget proposal that will virtually eliminate the agency designed to investigate corruption in his own office.Bevin s budget includes deep cuts to the state s Executive Branch Ethics Commission. The agency, which was created in the 1990 s, was formed in response to an FBI investigation which led to the indictments of almost two-dozen members of the state legislature.According to Katie Gabhart, the executive director of the Executive Branch Ethics Commission, the budget cuts will essentially hamstring the agency. We will be an investigative and auditing agency with no investigator and auditor,  Gabhart told state lawmakers, who are deliberating on the budget proposal this week .  Public servants are going to violate the ethics code   and if they know we have an ethics commission with so few resources that we can t enforce the code, then what is the point of having one? Also included in the proposed budget cuts is funding for the state s Registry of Election Finance.As the name of the agency implies, the office is charged with monitoring political campaigns and enforcing campaign finance laws in Kentucky.John Steffen, Executive Director of the Registry of Election Finance, told lawmakers that the governor s proposed budget cuts would leave the office without the ability to hire an auditor.State lawmakers responded by suggesting that the law could be changed so that some candidates would not be required to file campaign disclosures.In response, Steffen said I don t know what statutory obligations can be changed and not render our entire agency meaningless. Bevin was elected governor of Kentucky in November of 2015, amid accusations of election rigging. Bevin holds the distinction of being one of only three non-democratic governors to hold office in Kentucky since WWII.Prior to assuming the position of governor, Bevin was best known for delivering a political speech at a cockfighting rally in 2014, before losing an embarrassing senate race to Mitch McConnell.He later gained national attention when he praised Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, after she refused to provide marriage licenses to LGBT couples.It should come as no surprise that Bevin s budget seeks to slash the very agency which was created to investigate ethics violations committed in his own office.We saw the same thing from former Texas governor Rick Perry, another politicians with close ties to the Koch-backed Tea Party, in 2013.Nor should it be any surprise that the budget would virtually eliminate campaign finance oversight.The cuts are clearly designed to give corrupt Tea Party politicians like himself free reign in the state, without fear of political or legal repercussions.Image credit: Gage Skidmore, via Flckr ",News,"February 14, 2016",0,2850

Ex-U.S. Attorney Yang being considered for SEC chair: source,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Attorney Debra Wong Yang is being considered to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Trump administration, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. Yang is a partner at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles where she represents corporate defendants in white-collar crime investigations and compliance matters. Previously, Yang served as the first female Asian-American U.S. attorney. She was appointed to the Central District of California by Republican President George W. Bush in 2002 and left in 2006 to join Gibson Dunn.     Yang is a longtime friend of Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and donated to his presidential campaign.  If tapped, she would become the second consecutive former federal prosecutor to lead the SEC.  Its current chair, Mary Jo White, previously served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Yang did not respond to a call or an email requesting comment, and it is not clear if she is the leading contender for the top SEC job. Other names that have been floating around include former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who is helping oversee the transition for financial regulation, and Ralph Ferrara, a former SEC general counsel who is also on the transition team. Unlike Atkins or Ferrara, Yang is not considered to be as deeply steeped in securities regulatory policy matters. Yang has represented a variety of corporate clients and also previously served as a Justice Department-appointed monitor for a medical device company.  Currently, she is representing Allergan Plc in a lawsuit filed last month against a company called Amazon Medica for trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition related to its selling Botox with foreign labels to U.S. doctors. She has also represented Uber Technologies Inc in a class action lawsuit to force the company to pay its drivers overtime and minimum wage. Yang was among the Gibson Dunn attorneys who were hired to conduct an outside investigation into the “Bridgegate” scandal. Their March 2014 report exonerated Christie, finding that he had no involvement in the decision to close lanes on the George Washington Bridge linking New Jersey and New York City.  Two of Christie’s former close associates, Bridget Kelly, his deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were convicted for their roles in the scandal last month.

Trump's call for military buildup hits bump in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s push for a major military buildup suffered a setback on Thursday when the House of Representatives put plans on hold to fully fund the federal government through next Sept. 30 and instead resorted to temporary measures freezing spending at current levels. With a Dec. 8 deadline rapidly approaching for either extending federal funding in some way or triggering a partial government shutdown, the House next week will advance a temporary patch, according to a senior aide, and try to provide money through Dec. 22. That will give Congress more time to craft a second patch, the aide said, to operate the government through January. While the moves, if successful, would keep the Pentagon running at last year’s levels, they are far from Republican hopes of handing Trump about $634 billion in fiscal 2018 funding for the military’s regular operations, $85 billion above last year. For months, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have been working behind the scenes to broker a deal on overall spending levels for the current fiscal year, which already is two months old. Democrats are demanding increases in non-defense spending if military budgets are pumped up as Trump has demanded. It is unclear whether Republicans in Congress and Trump will allow unrelated controversial measures to be attached to either of the temporary spending bills. Democrats, whose votes normally are needed in the Republican-controlled Congress to pass spending bills, have been hoping to use their political leverage to win passage of an immigration measure by attaching it to an end-of-year appropriations bill. That bill would provide legal protections to “Dreamers,” the hundreds of thousands of undocumented people who came to the United States as children and have established roots. House Speaker Paul Ryan, asked about the possibility of attaching the immigration provision to a spending bill, said he wanted to resolve the issue. But he noted that Congress is under a March deadline to pass the Dreamers measure, saying “We’ve got other deadlines in front of that,” referring to the spending bills.

"WATCH: Wildly Popular, Outspoken Geert Wilders Is Being Called “The Dutch Trump”…Why His Plan To De-Islamize The Netherlands Is Resonating With Voters"," Make The Netherlands Great Again  is one of Geert Wilders campaign slogans. While Wilders may have many similarities to Donald Trump when it comes to being outspoken, the Dutch firebrand is much more outspoken about how the radical ideology of Islam has harmed Europe and specifically the Netherlands. He makes it very clear that  There are moderate Muslims, but there is no moderate Islam.  (Watch video at bottom of article to see his lengthy speech about Islam and how it affects European nations where Islamists have migrated).The French presidential election will take place in April and May. In September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be seeking a fourth term.All three elections will be critical for the future of the EU, as the rise of right-wing populism and nationalism threatens some of the key bedrocks of the European project.All eyes this week will be on the Freedom Party s Geert Wilders as he gets a chance to test his electoral popularity in an era of massive political upsets.The international media like to portray him as the Dutch Donald Trump. But beyond the big hair, the Twitter tirades and the brash personalities there are a number of key differences between the two.Only a 21-mile drive from the legalised prostitute booths and cannabis coffee shops of liberal bastion  Amsterdam, Almere is another world.It is a multicultural melting pot where nearly 40 per cent are immigrants.It is also the heartland of extremist Wilders  PVV, or Freedom Party, whose Nexit and anti-Islam rhetoric has propelled it to the top of opinion polls in a country where six per cent of the population is Muslim.Wilders   whose campaign  mottos include  Make the Netherlands great again    has won popularity by tempering his anti-Islam outbursts with traditional Dutch liberalism. He pointed out that immigrants are sometimes very hostile to homosexuals, Jews and women s rights. Wilders, who is progressive on gay and women s rights, has taken this message and radicalised it further. And that message resonates with people in Almere s bustling market.He is vowing to  de-Islamise  the Netherlands by shutting mosques and Islamic schools, banning the Koran and having  zero asylum seekers and no immigrants anymore from Islamic countries .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LyJz2P393oMuslims make up about 6 per cent of the Dutch population, mostly from Moroccan and Turkish backgrounds.While campaigning in February, Mr Wilders said,  there is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who make the streets unsafe, mostly young people   and that should change . The first paragraph of his manifesto states:  Millions of Dutch citizens have simply had enough of the Islamisation of our country. Enough of mass immigration and asylum, terror, violence and insecurity. Mr Wilders could win the popular vote, but he is unlikely to be his country s next prime minister.He had led the polls since November, but a  poll of polls  two weeks out from the vote had him just behind Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Mr Wilders was on 15.7 per cent, Mr Rutte 16.3 per cent.The Dutch House of Representatives has 150 members who are elected in four-year terms. Like the Australian Senate, their lower house is elected by a system of proportional representation.This means the seats are split between an array of major and minor parties. The next prime minister will probably have to form a coalition with a range of parties.All major parties have ruled out striking a power-sharing agreement with Mr Wilders, even if he wins the popular vote. They consider his policies to be either too extreme or simply unconstitutional.This does not mean a high vote for Mr Wilders would be meaningless. If he does do well on Wednesday, it will put pressure on whoever wins to move closer to his agenda.-ABCWilders explains the difference between Muslims and Islamists and how the Islamists will destroy countries where they migrate:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9pxfA_oOlo ",politics,"Mar 12, 2017",0,4099
OCTOBER 1st Could Mark End Of Free Speech On The Internet: How Obama Regime May Be Turning Control Of Internet Over To U.N.,"Anyone who s paying attention to the stunning final acts by this President should not be shocked by this potential threat to the world s freedom of speech. He is anything but a  lame duck The United States could give control of one of the internet s underlying systems to the United Nations after pledging not to, it has been claimed.The government has announced plans to relinquish control of the online addressing and numbering system, turning it over to a private international organization.For years, the US Department Of Commerce has been responsible for managing URLs and ensuring they lead to the proper web pages.It has subcontracted the task to a private nonprofit, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann).But the US government, which funded much of the internet s early development, has so far retained veto power.Although the US role has been minimal over the years, many foreign governments have complained that the internet can never be truly international if the US retains veto power.They have sought instead to shift responsibility to an inter-governmental body such as the UN International Telecommunication Union.But business, academic and civil-society leaders balked, worried that UN involvement would threaten the openness that has allowed the internet to flourish.Concerns were also raised that UN control would give authoritarian states like China and Iran equal votes among other countries in influencing policies that affect free speech.Lawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary for communications and information at the Commerce Department, said the endorsed plan won t replace Commerce s role with a government-led or inter-governmental solution.But the UN could end up managing the addressing system after all, according to Wall Street Journal columnist L Gordon Crovitz. He based his theory on an inquiry by Americans For Limited Government, an advocacy group that sent a Freedom Of Information Act request related to Icann s future.Icann had asked for  all records relating to legal and policy analysis  concerning antitrust issues for Icann, Crovitz reported. Icann currently benefits from an antitrust exemption because it operates under government control, he said.The contract between Icann and the US government is expected to expire on September 30.

"Abandoned by tourists, Bali town counts cost of Indonesia volcano","AMED, Indonesia (Reuters) - A Balinese town once bustling with holidaymakers has almost emptied of tourists after warnings that nearby Mount Agung could erupt at any time - a snapshot of the growing cost the rumbling volcano poses to Indonesia s economy. Business has slumped at many hotels, dive resorts and restaurants in towns around the volcano since authorities issue the highest alert level for Mount Agung last month.     An owner of a dive center in Amed, around 15 km (9 miles) from the volcano and just outside the official  danger zone , said many of her guests had canceled.  If (the situation) lasts for nine months or more... then we have no choice but to close down because we will have no money left to operate and pay the staff,  said Helene Rabate, a Spaniard who runs the center. Cafes and restaurants were largely empty and few visitors were seen at the usually crowded dive centers of this seaside town. The last time Agung erupted was in 1963, when more than 1,000 people were killed. Since then, tourism has transformed towns like Amed from sleepy fishing and agricultural villages.     Restaurant owner Wayan Widarti has seen a dramatic drop in customers.      It could be worse than when the Bali bombing happened because there s uncertainty on when (the eruption) is going to happen and how long we wait,  she said, referring to the 2002 nightclub bombing that killed 202 people and prompted a slump in visitors to the holiday island. Bali, famous for its surf, beaches and temples, attracted nearly 5 million visitors last year - more than half the total number of foreign tourists to Indonesia. Tourism, a cornerstone of Bali s economy, is Indonesia s fourth-biggest earner of foreign currency after natural resources like coal and palm oil. Indonesian policy makers have been seeking to boost an economy whose growth rate has been stuck at around 5 percent for the last few years, so any protracted damage to tourism will be particularly unwelcome.  Indonesian officials have said Bali remains safe for tourism, but there have been cancellations even in areas further away from the volcano amid concerns that ash clouds could disrupt air connections. Some tourists are still in the area at a safe distance from the volcano.   We plan to... just follow security instructions... and take a fast boat to escape if there is an eruption,  said Arlin Shiu, a woman from Hong Kong who was traveling with a friend. Disaster management authorities have imposed an exclusion zone of up to 12 km, prompting more than 140,000 residents to flee to neighboring villages.  For people who live in safe zones, there is no reason to evacuate,  Bali governor I Made Mangku Pastika said, adding that makeshift evacuation centers were straining under the weight of thousands of extra evacuees.

More Fake News: Mainstream Media Lies About Trump ‘Evicting’ White House Press Corp,"21st Century Wire says Many mainstream news outlets have been abuzz about the headline going around saying that Trump may  evict  the press corp from accessing the White House, but when one looks deeper into what is being written in such articles it quickly becomes clear that there is nothing official stated about disallowing any press from the White House.Here s the facts: Incoming White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, while discussing potentially moving the press corps room from the James Brady Press Room, to the White House Conference Room   in order to add more seating for press to cover President Trump in the White House said: If the plan goes through, one of the officials said, the media will be removed from the cozy confines of the White House press room, where it has worked for several decades. Members of the press will be relocated to the White House Conference Center near Lafayette Square or to a space in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.Look to the Blaze for how this is spun into a narrative which serves the dual purpose of agitating Trump s detractors into believing that he is going to suppress the freedom of the press and at the same time serves as a rouse to cause his ardent supporters to appear as though they are rejoicing at the potential of a Trump Presidency that would support suppressing the free press. When comparing the actual quotes with the editorial it is obvious that The Blaze and other mainstream media outlets are playing a wicked game of deceit to further the attempts at demonizing the incoming President.We can now see who the real  Fake News  culprits are.Below is one of the fake news articles circulating online   this one was floated out by Glenn Beck and his dubious media organization The Blaze . The BlazePresident-elect Donald Trump s transition team is reportedly considering plans to evict the White House press corps from accessing the White House.According to a report from Esquire, which cited three sources with the transition team, Trump administration officials are  seriously considering  plans to evict the press corps from being able to access the White House, arguing that it would allow the press increased access to Trump. There has been no decision,  incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer told Esquire, adding that  there has been some discussion about how to do it. More from Esquire:If the plan goes through, one of the officials said, the media will be removed from the cozy confines of the White House press room, where it has worked for several decades. Members of the press will be relocated to the White House Conference Center near Lafayette Square or to a space in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.Spicer, in his comments to Esquire, suggested that one of the reasons the administration is looking to evict the press from the White House is because they want to offer more members of the press the ability to cover Trump and the White House.Currently, there are only 49 seats in the White House James Brady Press Briefing Room, not enough to honor the hundreds, and sometimes, thousands of requests from journalists to cover Trump, Spicer said.However, a different, unnamed source told Esquire that the administration might have a different motive. According to the source, the administration is considering the move because of how the media covered Trump during the campaign and after his election victory.Trump has repeatedly lambasted the media for their coverage of him, regularly taking to Twitter to blast a news agency or a reporter by name.

 Hannity Gets His A** Handed To Him For Falsely Claiming Terence Crutcher Has Violent Criminal Past,"Fox News host Sean Hannity desperately tried to smear Terence Crutcher on Wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local Tulsa news anchor.Crutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer Betty Shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers. The murder was caught on camera.Clearly, the unarmed Crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them.But Sean Hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that Crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest. I understand that in this particular case Mr Crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,  Hannity said, which prompted Tulsa news anchor Russell Mills to smack Hannity down with facts. Well I ll tell you I looked up his history and I m not seeing a lot of criminal history,  Mills replied.  We have something called the OSCN   the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network. I was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. I found a couple of financial things. There s no violent criminal history for Mr. Crutcher that I ve been able to uncover. But Hannity didn t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that Crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest.Mills informed Hannity that there were no such warrants.Hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants. I have not seen any reporting on any warrants for Mr. Crutcher and I certainly haven t uncovered any myself,  Mills said.  There has been some misinformation floated. A disappointed Hannity resorted to claiming that he has a  source  within the department and said that  it s a matter of time of when they re gonna release this information. Here s the audio via Media Matters:Once again, Sean Hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. The bottom line, however, is that Crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. He wasn t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. Officer Betty Shelby should be arrested and charged with murder. Period.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 22, 2016",0,2497
" Bill Maher: Tax The Churches, Why Are We Paying For A ‘Homophobic Magic Act’? (VIDEO)","It s no secret that the comedic host of HBO s Real Time, Bill Maher, is no fan of religion. In fact, it s safe to say that he really pretty much hates the practice. He is one of America s most outspoken celebrity atheists, and Friday night s edition of his show saw him once again ripping religion for the amusement of his largely secular audience. What Maher had to say this time, though, wasn t just making fun of people who believe in god(s). He actually called for the Internal Revenue Service to make these institutions pay taxes.During his  New Rules  segment, Maher began: Why, in heaven s name, don t we tax religion? A sexist, homophobic magic act that s been used to justify everything from genital mutilation to genocide. You want to raise the tax on tobacco so kids don t get cancer, OK. But let s put one on Sunday school so they don t get stupid. Maher went on to say that the fact these churches owned billions in property got him, quote,  hopping mad.  He also pointed out something that likely has most religious people either panicking or in complete denial: religious belief is largely on the decline in the United States, which is traditionally seen as the most religious country in the developed western world. In fact, the youngest generation of Americans   Millennials   largely not only aren t actively religious, but they are uncomfortable with most mainstream religion, mostly due to the homophobia, misogyny, and other harmful ideas and practices therein.Maher continued on his rant: Almost a quarter of us are being forced to subsidize a myth that we re not buying into. Why am I subsidizing their Sunday morning hobby? They don t subsidize mine. After that brilliant closer, Maher flashed a photo of himself getting high with a friend on what is presumably one Sunday morning.The thing is, Bill Maher is right. We shouldn t be subsidizing churches. These people push all kinds of horrible things, including lobbying, at least indirectly, to enshrine bigotry into law against people they believe to be  sinners.  Our tax dollars should not be spent to uphold religion. People can believe what they like, but the rest of us shouldn t be paying for it.Thank you, Mr. Maher, for another hilariously brilliant   and oh so true   monologue on the truth about the tax-free status of America s religious institutions.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:https://youtu.be/Mw8MLub4siUFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"April 16, 2016",0,2528

Munich prosecutors arrest ex-Porsche executive in Audi emissions probe: source,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Munich prosecutors have arrested a former board member of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) unit Porsche in connection with an emissions scandal at carmaker Audi, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Wolfgang Hatz, former Research and Development chief at Porsche and head of powertrain development at Audi and parent Volkswagen in previous roles, was taken into custody, the person said, marking the first arrest of a former board member of one of Volkswagen s units in Germany. A lawyer representing Hatz declined to confirm the arrest and also declined any further comment. Hatz left Porsche last year, having been suspended since Volkswagen s emissions test-cheating scandal broke in September 2015. Investigations found no evidence against him, Porsche said in May 2016. Munich prosecutors earlier said they had arrested a second suspect and widened the number of suspects in their investigation. They did not disclose the suspect s identity. Prosecutors have also searched personal premises, a spokeswoman for the Munich prosecutors said, adding that corporate locations were not part of the raid. Audi has no knowledge of the arrest and continues to cooperate with authorities, a spokesman said. German business daily Handelsblatt first reported the arrest and Sueddeutsche Zeitung disclosed Hatz s identity. Audi admitted in November 2015, two months after parent Volkswagen s diesel emissions scandal broke, that its 3.0 liter V6 diesel engines were fitted with an auxiliary control device deemed illegal in the United States. In March, Munich prosecutors searched offices at the carmaker s Ingolstadt base, where about 44,000 workers are employed, and the premises of Jones Day, a U.S. law firm hired by Volkswagen to lead an investigation into the emissions scandal.     Four months later the U.S. Justice Department said it had charged a former Audi manager with directing employees at the company to design software to cheat U.S. emissions tests in thousands of Audi diesel cars. The former Audi manager, Italian citizen Giovanni Pamio, was subsequently arrested by Munich prosecutors on suspicion of fraud and false advertising in connection with the carmaker s emissions scandal. Pamio remains in custody pending ongoing German investigations and an extradition request by U.S. authorities. Pamio s lawyers said he is cooperating fully with prosecutors and has denied the allegations. ",worldnews,"September 28, 2017 ",1,2501
 This List Proves Republicans Are Damned LIARS About Obama’s Replacement For Scalia,"As you may have heard, virtually every Republican in the nation is spewing over the fact that America will be destroyed if Obama replaces Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. Their excuse to block any nominee until after the next election is what s known as the  Thurmond Rule.  Named after the amazingly racist Strom Thurmond, this isn t a real rule. It s only an opinion that a president shouldn t nominate a SCOTUS replacement in the last 6 months of their term.Yes, you are correct in what you just thought. Obama isn t ANYWHERE NEAR his last 6 months. But, when have things like facts stopped Republicans before?The reeking hypocrisy of Republicans on this issue is amazing. Not only is the  rule  they are using not an actual rule, but it doesn t even fit the facts of the situation. But wait, it gets far better. Republicans have said that for the past 80 years, we have not had SCOTUS appointments during the end of a president s term. Let s fact check that, shall we?Frank Murphy (1940) and Anthony Kennedy (1988), have   in the last 80 years   been appointed during the last year of a presidential term. There are 14 final year appointments total in the history of the United States, so to say it s some kind of  rule  is blatantly stupid.The full list is as follows: Oliver Ellsworth, 1796   Samuel Chase, 1796   William Johnson, 1804   Philip Barbour, 1836   Roger Taney, 1836   Melville Fuller, 1888   Lucius Lamar,   1888 George Shiras, 1892   Mahlon Pitney, 1912   John Clarke, 1916   Louis Brandeis, 1916   Benjamin Cardozo, 1932   Frank Murphy, 1940 and Anthony Kennedy, 1988.For now, let s focus on Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy was appointed during the last year of Ronald Reagan s term. Here is where Republican hypocrisy really goes wild.Mitch McConnell could be considered the head Republican cheerleader for the effort to block any nominee that Obama makes to replace Scalia. McConnell cited this rule, talking all about how it should be up to the American people to vote for a president who will make a nominee   giving the people a  voice  in the decision. How did Mitch McConnell vote on Anthony Kennedy? McConnell voted to confirm Anthony Kennedy, along with practically every other Republican on the list at that point. Where was his outrage back then?Senator Chuck Grassley made a huge stink out of voting in a replacement SCOTUS judge as well, saying it was standard practice  to not confirm SCOTUS nominee in an election year. You already guessed it. Grassley voted for Anthony Kennedy as well. Why did he do this when it wasn t standard practice, as he said?This ultra-stupid phenomenon is not only limited to old-school senators. Marco Rubio was asked both during the recent debate and by Chuck Todd this same question about a SCOTUS appointment. It was pointed out to him that Reagan appointed Kennedy in 87 during his last year. Marco responded: It doesn t really matter what Reagan did back in  87. I think the president should allow the next president to appoint the justice to the Supreme Court, and if it s me   and I anticipate that it will be   I m going to look for someone in the mold of Justice Scalia, who while irreplaceable, I think is a model jurist and one of the great jurists in American history. Source: Crooks and LiarsMarco really is being the most honest out of everyone.  It doesn t matter what Republicans do.  Frank, to the point and honest. Republicans don t care about rules or precedent. They just want to have a chance to stack the Supreme Court so they can destroy the last bits of America that are available to everyone, regardless of class.Featured image from Youtube",News,"February 15, 2016",0,3715
 Rosie O’Donnell Just CRUSHED What Was Left Of ‘Sh*tstain’ Donald Trump’s Pride (VIDEO),"Rosie O Donnell and Donald Trump have been engaged in a years-long feud, mostly because he leveled pathetic jabs at her over minor issues. But since Trump began his run for President, watching her smack him around has gone from entertaining to downright epic. On Wednesday, O Donnell made an appearance at a Boy George and Cyndi Lauper gig in New York. Speaking to the crowd, she launched into another attack on Trump that is likely eating away at him this very moment.In a video posted by the Daily Mail, O Donnell joked that she is  depressed because I f*cking hate that orange piece of sh*t.  She says he talked to her therapist about The Donald, and was told not to focus on the 2016 Republican frontrunner. Well I would rather give birth to a flaming iguana while taking a sh*t,  she recalls saying, apparently about his presidential prospects.  I hate him. I hate him. O Donnell noted that someone who was her  enemy for years  is friends with the  sh*tstain with a tinge of orange    a fact that  worries  her.All through her brief set, the audience cheered and laughed, but the man who recorded the video says that a few people were upset with O Donnell. Rosie s routine was just jaw-dropping,  he told the Daily Mail, noting that he began recording after the comedienne called Trump a sh*tstain.  She sounds like she is obsessed with Donald Trump and it was what she spent most of her very short act talking about.  He says that  not everyone was impressed,  tossing out an unverifiable claim that people around him were  shaking their heads in disagreement. One man near me turned to his wife turned and said,  I really hope Donald gets elected so she keeps her promise and moves to Canada ,  the man claims, apparently able to overhear someone s conversation with his wife over both O Donnell and the very enthusiastic crowd. He says that  Another lady was shouting,  Get off and let Cyndi sing'    something that is oddly missing from his video.Recently, O Donnell made headlines with a rather hilarious observation about Trump s mouth   specifically that it looks almost exactly like a puckered anus.Watch O Donnell s latest Trump smackdown below:Featured image via Getty Images (Dimitrios Kambouris)/Getty Images (Spencer Platt)",News,"May 26, 2016",0,2329
 What Facebook Just Did About Guns Is Going To Drive The NRA Insane,"Facebook announced that it will be banning its users from arranging private gun sales over both the main Facebook site and its photo-sharing site Instagram.While these new rules do not apply to licensed gun dealers, who can still post with the stipulation that they do not conduct purchases on the site, it does apply to private one-on-one sales that do not require background checks in many states.What is very important is that the move covers gun parts and ammunition as well. The banning of ammunition sales is obviously effective since without massive amounts of bullets you can t have massive amounts of gun violence. The fact it applies to gun parts is significant as well. Federal law doesn t currently cover some gun parts, like an  unfinished lower receiver.  They are treated as  not a gun  if they are 80 percent or less complete. This allows them to be sold without serial numbers or background checks. If you provide the parts to someone who is experienced enough to complete them, you basically have what will make an untraceable gun. Afterward, they can be assembled with other parts into a fully functional firearm. Some websites even sell the machines to complete receivers and boast about the fact you can build unserialized firearms legally in your own home.Facebook s status as a non-governmental entity gives it more control over what it can allow on its network. It simply doesn t matter if a person s slightly unfinished gun parts are legal to sell to anyone without background checks. Facebook can restrict whatever they want, just like they do with marijuana, pharmaceuticals or other illegal material. This helps tremendously in curbing the ways federal law has failed us.Facebook s head of product policy, Monika Bickert, said  Over the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another. We are continuing to develop, test and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution. Do you think that any Republicans will be boycotting Facebook now? What will their alternative be?featured image via wikicommons",News,"January 30, 2016",0,2265
" FBI Releases DAMNING Information About Russian Collusion, Trump TERRIFIED","The Washington Post reported Tuesday that former Trump advisor Carter Page was one of the members of the Trump campaign who were monitored by the FBI because of their communications with Russia. As part of an investigation into the campaign that long predates Director James Comey s infamous  Clinton email  letter that helped swing the election in Donald Trump s favor, a judge granted the Bureau s request   a decision that is not made lightly:The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump s favor.Page says that the real story isn t the fire   it s that people reported the fire. This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,  Page told the Post, failing to mention that a judge would not have granted the warrant if there was not already convincing evidence it was necessary.  I have nothing to hide. Ever since his administration began leaking like a colander, Trump and his crew have been working overtime to convince the American people that the information itself is unimportant (no matter how important it is), that the real problem is that someone is telling us about it. Page, of course, is no exception.The FBI officials did not reveal if the investigation uncovered evidence of a crime, but Page and the rest of the crew are acting very, very guilty.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"April 12, 2017",0,2008

So when Fox Business host John Stossel made a mockery of policies that have been put in place prevent rapes on college campuses over the weekend, he was shocked to find out that many people don t agree with his misogynistic jokes.The weekend segment was called  Campus Rape Hysteria,  and Stossel repeatedly argued throughout the program that there wasn t an epidemic and that any evidence related to sexual assault on campuses was debatable. Stossel also laughed at campus  initiatives that require men to have consent from a woman before and throughout a sexual experience. Stossel said: Colleges passed rules and some states passed laws that are supposed to protect women by defining the consent that s needed before a couple can have sex. California s law says  consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity. That means, I guess, a woman must repeatedly say,  Yes, please proceed.  I doubt many college students do that  but it is the law! To get his point across and show just  how crazy this could get, Stossel and his friends at Fox created a check-list-type form that mocked the consent process   except it wasn t received as well as he thought it would be.Fox News screenshotWhen Stossel showed his form to college students, most of them actually took the subject seriously   leaving the Fox host visibly disappointed that America s youth actually had morals and respect for women. He said: The kids must laugh at it. I can t believe anybody having sex gets repeated consent. Yet many students voiced the exact opposite. One male student said on the show, Something needs to be done. I m not sure this is the right way, but I think women need more protection.

 Trump Makes Startling Admission About His Wife And Run For The White House,"With Donald Trump taking the Republican Party and the nation by storm, it s easy to say that no one really saw him getting as far as he has during this election cycle. And while many of us wish he never threw his name into the ring as a GOP contender, it looks as though we re not the only ones who didn t want him to run.Even though she will be campaigning for him for the first time in Wisconsin this coming week, Melania Trump definitely had her reservations about her husband running in the first place.During an interview with the Washington Post, Trump revealed that Melania wasn t excited about the possibility of him becoming a candidate. According to Trump: She said,  We have such a great life. Why do you want to do this? And in a very Trumpian fashion, Trump responded to her as though he s Superman needed to come to the rescue of the nation: I said,  I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it.  . . . I could do such a great job. But Melania said: I hope you don t do it, but if you run, you ll win. However, Trump being Trump and unable to respect a woman s opinion on pretty much anything, he ignored his wife s wishes to just continue on with their life as usual to be with their son and run his business ventures. Instead, he decided to run for dictator of the universe, or at least that s sure as hell how it seems.It s becoming more clear than ever that Donald Trump is in this election not for the country, but rather for Donald Trump. Within the mind of the narcissist, he believes that he, with no experience whatsoever in political and diplomatic leadership, can take the reins of the United States of America. And while his applause lines may work on the nincompoops within the Republican party for the primary elections, they most certainly will not work in the general election among people who can actually critically think   the Democrats. However, we must make sure he and his imbecilic following doesn t even remotely get the chance to win, so remember   no matter who, vote blue.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 3, 2016",0,2148
 Trump Makes New Racist Attack On Judge Exposing Trump University (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is very upset at the judge overseeing the ongoing lawsuit in which the allegation is being made that his Trump University was nothing more than a sophisticated scam designed to separate regular Americans from their hard earned money. Despite the Republican nominee s attempts to detract attention away from the case, new revelations keep coming out that show the reality TV star s involvement in unsavory business practices.So Trump has been lashing out at the judge, and in explicitly racist terms. Trump went there once again in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.Donald Trump is claiming that a judge with Mexican heritage who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University has an  inherent conflict of interest  given the presumptive GOP nominee s rhetoric on immigration.[ ] I m building a wall. It s an inherent conflict of interest,  Trump told the Journal.So what Trump is saying is that since he is  building a wall  between the United States and Mexico, he can t be subject to judicial oversight from an American citizen with Mexican heritage.CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin accurately debunked the insanity of Trump s allegation, noting that: The ethnicity of the judge is not in it of itself a grounds for recusal, ever. And that is a claim that Trump   under the First Amendment   is certainly allowed to make, but it is completely wrong under the law. Trump is angry because the documents exposed by the Trump University suit (and ongoing fraud case from the New York state attorney general) show that Trump University sales people were told to target vulnerable customers in order to pressure them to buy expensive and worthless real estate training. Trump University documents said that struggling parents should be targeted, as should people who clearly could not afford the training who were pressured to increase their lines of credit using high pressure boiler room tactics.In response to the Trump University revelations, Hillary Clinton called Trump a  fraud,  and now he continues to lash out in a highly racist way, which has been the cornerstone of his presidential campaign.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 3, 2016",0,2229
 NSA Contractor Arrested For Leaking Classified Documents On Russian Hacking To The Media,"Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor at the NSA, was arrested for leaking a classified report containing what has been described as  Top Secret Level  information on Russia s attempt to interfere with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Winner appeared in federal court on June 5, facing one charge of removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet.Winner was employed by Pluribus International Corporation and had been assigned to a U.S. government facility in Georgia since February, working in a position that granted her a top-level security clearance. She had also previously held a similar clearance with the U.S. Air Force. Her arrest was announced about an hour after The Intercept published a story based on an NSA document detailing Russian attempts to hack American voting systems in 2016. Although the Justice Department hasn t stated whether Winner was arrested in connection with The Intercept s story, the site noted that the National Security Agency (NSA) report cited in its story was dated May 5, a date shared by an affidavit supporting her arrest.According to The Intercept s report, Russian military intelligence, specifically the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, conducted the cyber attacks described in the document: Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors   executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.   The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to   launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations. An affidavit sworn by FBI Agent Justin Garrick claimed that the government was notified of the leaked report by the news outlet that received it and the agency that housed the report determined only six employees had made physical copies, one of whom was Winner. The affidavit also stated that Garrick interviewed Winner at her home and she admitted intentionally identifying and printing the classified intelligence reporting at issue  and mailing it to the news outlet. The U.S. Government Agency examined the document shared by the News Outlet and determined the pages of the intelligence reporting appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space,  the affidavit continued.Titus Thomas Nichols, Winner s attorney, declined to confirm whether his client had been accused of leaking the document. My client has no [criminal] history, so it s not as if she has a pattern of having done anything like this before,  Nichols said in a phone interview on Monday to the Associated Press.  She is a very good person. All this craziness has happened all of a sudden,  adding that she hadn t stated or shown any form of confession.Winner remains in federal custody pending a hearing scheduled for June 8.Featured image via Facebook",News,"June 6, 2017",0,3093

Sexism or compliment? German politician stokes debate,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A female German politician has triggered a fierce debate by accusing a former ambassador of sexism after he failed to recognize her at a conference and then said he was not expecting such a young and beautiful woman as a speaker. Sawsan Chebli, a 39-year-old state secretary in the Berlin city government, said she was sitting in the front row waiting to speak at a meeting of the Indo-German Society but was not recognized by the head of the group, Hans-Joachim Kiderlen. When he realized his mistake, the retired former German ambassador to India reportedly said:  I wasn t expecting such a young woman. And you are also so beautiful.  Chebli, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats, went ahead with her speech but posted on her Facebook page afterwards that she was in shock.  Of course, I m always experiencing sexism, but I have never experienced anything like what happened today,  she said. Her comments prompted an outpouring in German newspapers and social media, already abuzz as million of women across the world have been sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and abuse in an online campaign using the hashtag #MeToo. Chebli, a former spokeswoman for the German foreign ministry born to Palestinian refugee parents, was swamped with insults on her Facebook page, including suggestions that she wear a Muslim headscarf if she does not want to receive compliments. She also received messages of support, including from women who had similar experiences, including Teresa Buecker, editor-in-chief of the feminist magazine Edition F.  I have also been called up to the stage as the  beautiful speaker  - it is degrading and disrespectful,  Buecker wrote on Twitter. Kiderlen wrote to Chebli to apologize for his  inappropriate address and greeting , the Tagesspiegel daily reported on Thursday. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1,1890
The Court Case Against the ‘Travel Ban’ Executive Order,"21st Century Wire says The legal battle is waging on over President Trump s Executive Order Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the US when on Saturday the Department of Justice requested a lift of the stay placed on enforcement of the Executive Order. The federal appeal court denied the DoJ s request, noting the the plaintiffs should first be given an opportunity to respond. Contrary to what many media outlets are saying, this was not a case of the courts saying that the order is  unconstitutional  as the ACLU and a number of Attorney Generals are claiming, but is standard practice in appeals cases.The Duran provides some further legal analysis on this developing case below  Alexander Mercouris The DuranThe legal moves and counter-moves in the court case concerning Donald Trump s  travel ban  Executive Order may appear complicated, but in reality they follow standard practice.  Since there are some misunderstandings in reporting them I will provide a brief explanation.The federal judge in Seattle on Friday did not rule that the Executive Order is unconstitutional or illegal.  Rather he ordered a temporary two week stay on the enforcement of the Executive Order until this question of its legality is decided in further argument before him in two weeks time.In doing so the judge acted fully within his powers, though as I understand it he took a different view from a different federal judge in Massachusetts who apparently refused to grant a similar stay when he was asked to do so at roughly the same time that the judge in Seattle was making his decision.The Department of Justice is appealing the stay.  It is doing so on the grounds that the Executive Order is fully legal and constitutional and needs to be brought back into force immediately in order to protect the US from potential terrorists, who might take advantage of the stay to enter the US during the two week period when it is in effect.On Saturday the Department of Justice asked the federal appeal court in San Francisco (which will hear the appeal) to lift the stay.  The federal appeal court however refused to do so, saying that the plaintiffs who applied for the stay should be given an opportunity to respond.  It gave the plaintiffs until Sunday (ie. today) to file their objections to the Department of Justice s application to lift the stay, with the Department of Justice instructed to file its counter-objections on Monday (ie. tomorrow).Contrary to some media claims, this is completely standard practice during appeals.  It would be very unusual for an appeal court to set aside a judge s order   even a temporary order   without a full hearing, and the Department of Justice will undoubtedly have known this when it applied to the appeal court to have the stay lifted on Saturday.The reason the Department of Justice made the application on Saturday is because it wants to emphasise to the appeal court the urgency of the situation.  This is important, not just because of the danger of terrorists entering the US during the period of the stay, but because unless the appeal court is convinced of the urgency of the situation it will simply say that the Department of Justice should wait until the hearing ordered by the federal judge in Seattle in two weeks time.In other words by insisting that the stay be lifted immediately the Department of Justice is providing reasons to the appeal court to take the case out of the federal judge s hands, so that it can decide the case itself.  That was the true purpose of the application on Saturday, and it succeeded.I expect the appeal court in San Francisco to decide the appeal this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday.As I am not an expert in US constitutional law I do not know what the outcome of the appeal will be.  I should say that it would be completely wrong to try to guess the outcome from the decision the appeal court took on Saturday.The appeal will be purely on the question of the rightness or otherwise of the stay.  If the appeal decision goes against the President it will be for the Department of Justice to put his case to the federal judge at the full hearing in two weeks time.  If that decision also goes against the President, he can appeal again to the federal appeal court in San Francisco, and beyond that to the Supreme Court.By contrast if the Department of Justice wins the appeal this week then I would expect the plaintiffs to drop the case in Seattle and try to go directly to the Supreme Court.  Since the appeal court would have effectively affirmed the legality of the Executive Order, there would be little point in the plaintiffs continuing to contest the Executive Order before the federal judge in Seattle Continue this report at The DuranREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"February 6, 2017",0,4930
Candidates and what's at stake in Honduras presidential election,"TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Hondurans voted on Sunday in a presidential election that many expect to result in a second term for the current U.S.-friendly leader, eight years after he supported a coup against a former president who also floated the idea of reelection. Based on recent polls, Juan Orlando Hernandez, of the center-right National Party, looks set to profit from a 2015 Supreme Court decision that overturned a constitutional ban on reelection. He is running against television host Salvador Nasralla, who helms a broad left-right coalition called the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship. Below are the candidates  main proposals: Juan Orlando Hernandez - A former head of Congress who studied at the State University of New York and Honduras  military academy, Hernandez, 49, enjoys a good rapport with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and is seen as a reliable U.S. ally in Central America. - Hernandez has managed to lower the murder rate and raise growth while expanding his influence into the furthest reaches of the Honduran government.  - Critics say Hernandez, who was born in a humble, rural family of 17 siblings, has stifled dissent and is seeking to consolidate power. U.S. government officials say they want him to revitalize stalled legislation to place a cap on presidential term limits and assuage fears he will not cede power.  - With his slogan  Change has begun and should continue,  Hernandez says he will keep up his militarized fight against the gangs that have turned the Central American nation into one of the world s most violent. - Hernandez says his Honduras 20/20 plan will help lure investment in textiles, call centers and car manufacturing and lift growth. He wants to push ahead with special economic zones, a project that has so far yielded few concrete results. He says his policies will create 600,000 new jobs in the next four years. Salvador Nasralla - A colorful 64-year-old sports and talent TV show host descended from Lebanese immigrants, Nasralla promises to put an end to years of violence, poverty and graft. - Nasralla s Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship coalition includes the Liberty and Refoundation Party, or LIBRE. It is controlled by ousted former President Manuel Zelaya, who many believe is the true force behind the coalition. - A non-traditional political figure who has benefited from his entertainment background to build support among those disenchanted by business-as-usual Honduran politics, Nasralla trailed Hernandez by 15 points in a September poll, the last permitted before the election. - Nasralla says he will ask the United Nations to install an anti-graft body, similar to one operating in Guatemala, to probe and bring charges in corruption cases. He would maintain the Military Police created by Hernandez but wants to start a community police force to work in violent slums. He would also continue firing corrupt national police officers, while hiring up to 25,000 new officers. - Plans for the economy are vague, but the coalition has proposed lowering the sales tax and slashing a Hernandez-imposed corporate levy that has enraged the private sector.  - The Alliance has proposed a referendum on how the current Constitution should be rewritten, either by Congress or by a new national assembly. It also wants a referendum on stripping the powers of the Supreme Court, which it accuses of being pliant to Hernandez.  ",worldnews,"November 26, 2017 ",1,3491
 Kentucky Woman Brutally Beaten By Man For Looking Too ‘Masculine’ While Onlookers Do NOTHING,"Ever since the Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, a few things have happened. The number of anti-LGBT hate crimes has seemed to rise, the Christian Right has gone on the offensive (and, in the process, has been very offensive), and Republicans just can t stop talking about men kissing and the possibility of penises in women s restrooms. A Kentucky woman was a victim of one of the aforementioned hate crimes on Thursday simply because a man thought she looked too masculine   and that s not even the worst part.Brittany Nicole Wallace wrote on her Facebook timeline that a man assaulted her because she looks like a  dike.  She recounted the horrifying experience:He told me that he would  beat me like the man I want to be.  He said,  people like me make him hate the world . He started by hitting me over and over in the face until he got me down. After I was down he began to kick me in the stomach, side, and face. Anyone that knows me knows that I tried my best to fight back. The truth is he was bigger and stronger than me.Then it gets heartbreaking. Despite a number of onlookers, not a single person stepped in to help. Not a single person had the decency to recognize that a man beating a woman even after she was on the ground is wrong:I believe that if I had long hair and dressed more feminine this would not have happened to me. The sad part is that no one would come help me either. Several people stood around and watched this happen to me. Again, I truly believe that if I had a more feminine appearance someone would have helped.Despite the attack, Wallace says that it has strengthened her resolve to fight against this kind of hatred:This has not only physically but mentally and emotionally damaged me. I will do everything I can to try to put a stop to this hate and violence. I love people and try to help people all the time. All I ask if you read this is to please stop the hate, and help people when you see them getting hurt verbally, emotionally and physically!She even included photos of her injuries:This sort of hatred needs to stop. Unfortunately, half the country follows a party whose entire platform is built on hatred, whose frontrunner practices almost every form of bigotry possible. Unfortunately, with Right-Wing media and politicians constantly reminding their  poorly educated  followers of the alleged evils of the LGBT community. Even more unfortunately, we can expect this sort of thing if Republicans manage to win not only the Presidency, but seats in the Senate and House.We can t allow this to continue.

White House to revamp U.S. coal program as soon as Friday: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration will announce as soon as Friday an overhaul of how the United States manages coal development on federal land, according to government and conservationist sources, in a further move to confront climate change. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Democratic President Barack Obama said he would “change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.” The new plan will require federal officials, when weighing land use decisions, to consider how mining and burning coal adds to greenhouse gas pollution, said environmental group sources familiar with the plans. The overhaul also will aim to maximize returns for taxpayers by updating royalty rates when mining companies pull coal from federal land, said the sources. “We’re working to have this tomorrow,” said a Bureau of Land Management official who declined to give details on the administration’s plans. Environmentalists have urged the White House to freeze new coal leases on federal land until it accounts for how that fossil fuel development contributes to climate change. A moratorium on coal leases could be part of the reform, said environmental sources familiar with the effort. Coal leases are often awarded without a competitive bidding process, frequently going to a single bidder, and officials can undervalue the fuel heading to market, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has concluded. “Public lands should be developed in the public interest but taxpayers have been shortchanged for decades,” said Theo Spencer of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. The Energy Information Administration says roughly 41 percent of U.S. coal production occurs on federal land. The coal industry had been battered in recent years by competition from cheap natural gas and clean-air regulations that have raised costs for burning the black rock. This week, Arch Coal, one of the nation’s largest coal companies, filed for bankruptcy - the latest mining company to seek protection from creditors in the current downturn. The National Mining Association was not immediately available for comment. ",politicsNews,"January 14, 2016 ",1,2288
Republican VP candidate Pence in 'excellent' health: doctor,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence released a letter from his doctor on Saturday declaring Donald Trump’s running mate was in “excellent” health. “You are medically able to maintain your high level of professional work and your physical activity programs without limitations,” wrote Michael Busk of the St. Vincent Health, Wellness and Preventative Care Institute in Indianapolis. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has released a note from his doctor saying that he, too, was in “excellent” health. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, and her running mate, Tim Kaine, also released medical information this week. The candidates moved to show their physical fitness to run for office after Clinton fell ill on Sunday at an event in New York City, prompting her campaign to disclose that she had been diagnosed with non-contagious, bacterial pneumonia. Busk said in the letter dated Thursday that he last examined Pence, who is the governor of Indiana, in July and has been his doctor since 2013. Pence exercises four days a week, mainly by biking, and takes no medications except for seasonal allergies. He had hernia repair surgery in 2015 and had basal cell carcinomas, a common form of skin cancer, removed in 2002 and 2010, the letter said. Pence’s father died of a heart attack, the letter said. But it said his father smoked cigarettes, while Pence neither smokes nor drinks alcohol. Pence’s cardiologists feel he has a “very good and strong heart,” the letter said.

 President Obama Says He Believes The Affordable Care Act Will Survive Trump (VIDEO),"The president says he doesn t think Obamacare is going anywhere just yet. In an interview on ABC s This Week, Obama said he doesn t think the Affordable Care Act will be fully repealed quite like Republicans hope   and millions of Americans fear.President Obama said that although there is definitely the  risk  of a full repeal, he simply doesn t think the GOP can come up with a viable replacement plan. After all, he explained with amusement, they have been trying to do so for seven full years and have always failed. But when asked directly if he thought his signature health care legislation would survive, the president said he had faith that the ACA would endure. I think it will,  he said.  It may be called something else. And as I said, I don t mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications,  Obama continued. Some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they wouldn t cooperate because they didn t want to make the system work, and re-label it as Trumpcare, I m fine with that. Obama said he isn t worried about having his name attached to the ACA, he is worried about the millions of Americans who depend on the legislation for their medical care. He noted all the letters he gets from real people whose lives have literally been saved because of Obamacare and said that this is what matters to him. This is his legacy, he insisted, not having his name stamped on it.Republicans are still bound and determined to repeal Obamacare and replace it with  something better.  However, as Obama points out, this isn t necessarily what the American people want. He notes that many Trump voters have said they never really believed that Donald Trump would take away their health care. Obama is hopeful that the will of the American people can keep the ACA around for a long time to come, even if it is called Trumpcare.Watch what President Obama had to say about Obamacare today, here:[ad3media campaign= 1414 ]Featured image via Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images",News,"January 8, 2017",0,2065
World Bank approves $150 million to restore services in Yemeni cities,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Bank agreed on Thursday to grant war-torn Yemen $150 million to help some of its hardest-hit cities restore basic services and fight a cholera epidemic. An agreement signed by a World Bank official and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is funded by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank s fund for the world s poorest countries.   The new project will target issues like uncollected trash and untreated sewage water ... and also address access to electricity for critical services and urgent needs for road repair to improve mobility and access,  a statement issued by the UNOPS said. Civil war broke out in Yemen in March 2015, between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The agreement covers the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa and the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah as well as the southern port city of Aden, the temporary capital of Hadi s government. Some 900,000 suspected cholera cases have been recorded in the past seven months, including 2,200 deaths.  The heads of three U.N. agencies issued a fresh plea on Thursday for the Saudi-led military coalition to lift its blockade on Yemen, saying that without aid shipments  untold thousands of innocent victims, among them many children, will die . One million children are at risk from a diphtheria outbreak and millions threatened by hunger, the heads of the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the World Health Organization said in the joint statement.

ILLEGAL ALIEN ARRESTED FOR SHOOTING Teen Girlfriend and 3 Yr Old Son And Lighting Them On Fire While Boy Was Still Alive Was Previously Deported [VIDEO],"Since when did future Democrat voters take precedent over enforcing the law? Family members suspect jealousy may have led to the gruesome slayings of an Othello teen and her 3-year-old son found shot and severely burned in a remote part of Franklin County.Maria G. Cruiz-Calvillo, 18, and Luis F. Lopez-Cruz were identified Monday as the bodies found last week inside a vehicle that was set on fire in a ravine near the intersection of Scootney and Ridge roads.Luis likely was still alive when the car went up in flames, according to Dan Blasdel, Franklin County coroner.Luis would have turned four years old on Thursday. She was a really good person. She was always smiling,  said Karen Rodriguez, a sister-in-law of Cruiz-Calvillo who spoke for the family.  He was a happy kid. He was really playful and loved to be outside. Prudencio Juan Fragos-Ramirez, 25, of Connell, reportedly had recently started dating Cruiz-Calvillo and is suspected of killing the pair.Fragos-Ramirez was arrested hours into the investigation at his home less than a mile from where the bodies were found. He appeared Monday in Franklin County Superior Court, where Judge Carrie Runge set bail at $1 million.Runge ordered Fragos-Ramirez, who has previous convictions for DUI and driving while suspended, held for up to 72 hours while prosecutors determine what charges to file. Prosecutors say Fragos-Ramirez was deported in 2014 and got back into the country illegally.https://youtu.be/lsBOZqGQ1fcThe sheriff s office initially spelled his name Flagos-Ramirez, but court records show it s spelled Fragos-Ramirez.Family members had never met Fragos-Ramirez, though Cruiz-Calvillo talked to her mother about a guy she was seeing, whom she apparently referred to by the nickname  Loco,  Rodriguez said. (The family) thinks she never wanted a serious relationship with him,  Rodriguez said.  It s jealousy. Cruiz-Calvillo and Luis had gunshot wounds, Blasdel said. Tests to confirm whether they were still alive when the fire started have been requested.Firefighters found the bodies July 2 as they battled the car fire near a large orchard, court documents said. Franklin County deputies discovered the license plates were registered to an Othello man, who told investigators his niece, Cruiz-Calvillo, drove the vehicle.Family members last saw Cruiz-Calvillo the afternoon of her death as she was leaving Othello with Luis for Pasco to make a car payment, court documents said. She routinely went to Pasco to make car payments. We checked with the bank,  Rodriguez said.  She made the payment at 3:43 (p.m.). Two neighbors saw Cruiz-Calvillo and Luis arrive at Fragos-Ramirez s home about 4:40 p.m., court documents said. The neighbors recognized the mother and son because they frequent the house on Hogback Road.Between 10 and 20 minutes later, the neighbors saw the pair and Fragos-Ramirez walking towards Cruiz-Calvillo s car, court documents said. They didn t see Fragos-Ramirez return to the house and didn t see him again until about 7 p.m.Smoke was spotted coming from the ravine where the bodies were found about 20 to 30 minutes after the trio was seen leaving the home. It took detectives eight minutes to drive from the home to the spot where the bodies were found.Detectives were able to track down Fragos-Ramirez for an interview after Cruiz-Calvillo s brother, Arturo Calvillo, remembered meeting a man who matched the description of Fragos-Ramirez while at a house on church business, court documents said. Calvillo took Detective Jason Nunez to the house, and Nunez contacted a woman there.The woman told Nunez she had a brother who was at the house when Calvillo came over, court documents said. She called Fragos-Ramirez and handed the phone to Nunez, who then set up an interview.Via: Tri City Herald",left-news,"Jul 8, 2015",0,3950
 Bill Maher Just Dropped A Truth Bomb About Trump Voters That Every Liberal Needs To Hear (VIDEO),"We on the left are all wondering why, out of the vast field of GOP candidates, Donald Trump roared to the nomination, toppling traditional candidates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and even hard-right bigots like Ted Cruz. No, they picked The Donald, and no matter how vulgar he was, how bigoted he was, how dangerously unhinged he was, they still picked him. Then, they got him elected president, to the horror of most Americans and to the delight of that swath of people who were so entranced by Trump from the moment he rode down that escalator.Well, now, we are 100 days in, and the Trump presidency is just as chaotic and terrifying as we all knew it would be. Trump is incompetent and dangerous, as well as an embarrassment on the world stage. Yet, his voters are sticking with him. And Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time, thinks he knows why. Remember when Trump said he could shoot someone in the middle of New York City s Fifth Avenue and not lose voters? That s likely true. And Maher has the answer as to why. He said in his  New Rules  segment on Friday night: Trump supporters aren t changing their minds because the problem isn t in the mind. It s lower. It s emotional. He could have Ann Frank s skeleton in his closet. They d all vote for him again. He continued, letting liberals know why facts, vulgarity, incompetence, and any other outrage Trump might commit matters not to his devoted followers: I think it s a gut feeling that the world has changed and they don t like it. Trump is going to change it back to the way it was. Maher then went on to mock Trump voters in a hillbilly affect, saying things like: I ain t no racist, but why does American need to have a black Santa Claus? And did I mention Bruce Jenner has tits now? Returning to his normal voice, Maher explained: I think I speak for most liberals when I say, I don t care about black Santa. I don t think it s going to make the Little Drummer Boy start cutting himself. But to Trump voters, making Santa black is unthinkable. It d be like making Jesus Middle Eastern. Maher concluded, summing up just why Trump voters put him in the White House, despite the fact that he is clearly the last person who should be president: This is why building that stupid wall is still a key issue for them. It represents keeping out not just immigrants but everything that is new and different and scary and unfamiliar. And this is just it. These people don t care what Trump does. He ll make America comfortable for them again, in their minds. There will be no more religions besides Christianity, there will be no LGBTQ rights, black people and other minorities will know their places, women would be in the kitchen and the bedroom where they belong rather than in the boardroom, and white men will control everything again.This is about cultural anxiety and bigotry. It really was, as Van Jones says, a white lash. Therefore, don t try and woo Trump voters away from him with facts. They seriously don t care.Watch Bill Maher s very important message below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 29, 2017",0,3164
Surveys contradict Trump claim that Comey had lost FBI confidence,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Annual employee surveys released by the FBI on Wednesday show former Director James Comey was highly regarded, contradicting President Donald Trump’s claim when he fired Comey this year that he had lost the confidence of the agency’s workers. The voluntary survey conducted in 2017 showed Comey received top marks on all but two of more than 90 questions. He scored high marks for expressing a compelling vision for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and helping morale, with respondents strongly agreeing that they would choose to work with him again. The findings contradict statements made by Trump and White House officials at the time of Comey’s firing on May 9. Trump insisted he fired Comey because of job performance and told a news conference the FBI chief “was very unpopular with most people.” Trump portrayed the FBI under Comey as being a mess. Comey told a Senate panel that White House claims the FBI was in disarray and poorly led were “lies, plain and simple.” Other senior FBI officials praised Comey and said they were proud to have worked with him, but the workplace surveys were the first broad measure of employee sentiment toward him. Trump’s reasons for firing Comey shifted over time, and he told one interviewer the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was on his mind when he made the decision. Comey told lawmakers he thought he was fired because of the Russia investigation. His firing is now part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into ties between Russian officials and Trump’s political campaign. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2017 ",1,1672
"Mexico's presidential front-runner vows more welfare, formalizes bid","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican front-runner for next year s election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, formalized his bid for the presidency on Tuesday and promised his government would spend on the young, elderly and farmers.  Left-winger Lopez Obrador, who had a 12-point lead in one recent poll, wants to significantly change Mexico s approach to the economy, security and education, vowing more support for the poorest but without new taxes or higher debt levels. He promised cheap fertilizer and fixed produce prices for farmers with a goal of making Mexico self-sufficient in food. He also offered paid apprenticeships for unemployed youth, grants for students and higher pensions for the elderly  - expanding on popular welfare programs introduced when he governed Mexico City.  A win by the 64-year-old self-declared nationalist on July 1 could reverse a Latin American trend toward right-leaning governments and set the stage for friction with U.S. President Donald Trump over his anti-migrant language and policies.  Lopez Obrador promised friendly ties with the U.S. government but said he would not accept  racist, hegemonic or arrogant attitudes.      He also proposed a shakeup of government, saying he would move more than a dozen ministries and federal bodies including state oil company Pemex from the capital to regional towns.  The federal government will be decentralized,  Lopez Obrador said, in a speech in the capital after registering his intention to run for his National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party. He also promised not to increase fuel prices.   In the clearest language yet, he repeated his intention to consult with victims of drug crime about the possibility of offering amnesty to criminals who commit to rehabilitation.  The only aim, there is no other, is to explore all the possibilities to curb the violence and guarantee peace for the people of Mexico,  he said. A poll this week found that two-thirds of Mexicans rejected the idea of amnesty, in a country on track for its deadliest year in modern history with nearly 21,000 murders through October.  Lopez Obrador, who has unsuccessfully run for the presidency twice before, will likely face Jose Antonio Meade, running for the ruling party, and Ricardo Anaya, who heads a left-right coalition of opposition parties.  He did not say how he would finance his spending plans, but in the past has said all new spending would be funded by ending government corruption and waste.

Uganda parliament debate on presidential age cap halted as scuffles break out,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda s parliament abruptly adjourned a debate on Tuesday over extending President Yoweri Museveni s decades in power after a lawmaker said soldiers had entered the building and members of parliament scuffled with police.  There were so many (soldiers), I saw them. They were in the chaplaincy,  legislator Gaffa Mbwatekamwa, among several in Museveni s ruling party who oppose extending his rule, told a local television station. Scuffles broke out between lawmakers and police shortly after speaker Rebecca Kadaga adjourned the debate, just moments starting it early on Tuesday. It was unclear what triggered the confrontation. Television footage showed chaotic scenes of lawmakers and police both trying to address the cameras. The incident followed a similar disruption to a debate on the issue in September. The army did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Police spokesman Emilian Kayima said they had no immediate comment but would issue a statement later. Lawmakers were debating a draft bill that would remove a constitutional age cap that bars Museveni from standing again.  The constitution limits the age of a presidential candidate to 75, making 73-year-old Museveni ineligible to stand at the next election in 2021. Museveni has ruled for 31 years but public anger is mounting over corruption, rights violations and poor social services.  The opposition, church leaders, and even some members of the ruling party oppose the amendment. Police have put down protests against it using teargas, beatings, detentions and live bullets. At least two people have been killed. A previous attempt to debate the bill in September ended with lawmakers trading punches and throwing chairs and the forcible intervention of security forces. Several legislators were hospitalized with injuries. Mbwatekamwa said he recognized some members of the military in parliament from the fracas in September.  Some are in civilian clothes, some of the soldiers are the ones who manhandled us the other time,  he said.  Proceedings resumed about two hours after they were suspended and stretched on for about seven hours before Kadaga adjourned them again to Wednesday, when a final vote on the bill is expected. The latest attempt to debate the law started on Monday with the presentation of a report by a House committee. The speaker suspended six legislators opposed to the measure on Monday for disorderly conduct.  Both police and military have been deployed around parliament this week. Lawmakers say the heavy security is designed to intimidate them, but police say it is to prevent protests. The military usually does not comment on political matters. Several African leaders have amended laws designed to limit their tenure. Such moves have fueled violence in countries including Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.

Brexit blues? Britons stay cheerful in tumultuous 12 months,"LONDON (Reuters) - Happiness levels in Britain have inched up to reach their highest rate since measurements of wellbeing began in 2011,  despite the political uncertainty since last year s Brexit vote, the statistics office said. The average level of happiness for the 12 months to March this year rose slightly among the roughly 150,000 people polled to 7.51 out of 10 after leveling off in the previous two years at slightly below 7.50.   Today s figures may surprise some, showing a small increase in both reported happiness and life satisfaction during a period that has seen political change and uncertainty,  ONS statistician Matthew Steel said. Higher employment rates and perceived improvement in personal finances could explain some of the rise, he added. A narrow majority of Britons who took part in the country s European Union membership referendum in June last year voted to leave the EU. Shortly afterwards, David Cameron resigned as prime minister and was replaced by Theresa May. Despite the political shock, Britain s economy held up in 2016 although it slowed sharply in the first six months of 2017.  A monthly survey of consumer sentiment published by research firm GfK on Aug. 31 showed households were their most pessimistic in a year in July before a slight improvement in August.

Dutch tourist group cuts South Africa visit short after armed bus robbery,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A group of 36 Dutch tourists were flying out of South Africa on Tuesday after they were robbed at gunpoint on Sunday in a brazen heist while traveling from Johannesburg s main international airport to their hotel, officials said. The incident is an embarrassment for South Africa, a country keen to promote itself as a tourist destination but scarred by violent crime. Tourism accounts for 3 percent of GDP and is seen as a bright spot in an otherwise moribund economy. Journalists saw the group pull out of the hotel in a bus under police escort after they met with South Africa s police minister and tourist minister as well the ambassador from the Netherlands.  We ll bring these criminals to book. We ll find them,  Police Minister Fikile Mbalula told journalists after the meeting. The bus was stopped on Sunday night by a vehicle with police markings and one man in police uniform with five accomplices in civilian clothing robbed the tourists at gunpoint. Nobody was shot but two people were injured, police said. Dutch ambassador Marisa Gerards said most of the tourists had to cut their visit short because all of their belongings were taken.   Ironically, she said many of the tourists had  booked this organized trip out of safety concerns.   South Africa entices tourists with first-rate infrastructure, sunshine, beaches, wildlife and an exchange rate that makes its food and wine cheap by global standards.  But a jobless rate of over 25 percent and glaring income disparities have worsened its problems with violent crime. The murder rate is 34 per 100,000 people, according to data released by police last year, almost seven times the rate in the United States. ",worldnews,"September 26, 2017 ",1,1776
NFL opposes U.S. Republican tax plan on stadium funding,"(Reuters) - The National Football League said on Tuesday it opposes a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans that could force teams to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction. Under the legislation unveiled last week, local governments could no longer fund the building or renovation of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax-exempt, public-purpose bonds, the sort of bonds typically used to fund schools, libraries and public transit. According to the NFL, building new stadiums enhances economic development in cities that are home to the venues and federal tax breaks should be available. “You can look around the country and see the economic development that’s generated from some of these stadiums,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told a conference call. “These sorts of infrastructure projects have a long history and the benefits of them are obvious in many of our communities around the country, so we will continue to make our opposition known on that.” President Donald Trump has called for an end to the subsidy, at least for the NFL, after some of its players angered the Republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in 2015. A report last year by the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based social sciences research group, found that of the 45 major-league stadiums built or overhauled since 2000, 36 were at least partly funded by tax-exempt municipal bonds. The NFL’s Oakland Raiders are expected to begin playing in Las Vegas in 2020 and construction on a new stadium is already underway. Lockhart refused to what, if any, impact the bill could have on the viability of the new stadium. “That is a hypothetical at this point and we’d have to see how the final bill comes out,” he said. “What gets proposed out of the writing committee from the party in control very often is not what is eventually signed into law, so we’ll have to see where that goes.”             ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2017 ",1,2146
 Alabama Republican Just Defended Pedophilia Using The Bible,"The Washington Post just came out with an explosive report about the extremist candidate that Alabama is running for the United States Senate, Roy Moore. This is a man who has said that homosexuality should be illegal, got removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice for defying the United States Supreme Court   once over a giant monument of the Ten Commandments he refused to remove from the courthouse, and once for defying the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage   and has always made incendiary and bigoted statements that are out of the mainstream even for the Republican Party. Now, it has come out that Moore molested a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30 s.Now, one would think that this would be a bridge too far for anyone   especially the types of people who make entire political careers out of trying to legislate what goes on in other people s bedrooms on the basis of their twisted version of  morality,  but no. At least one Alabama Republican is defending Moore s actions, and he is using the Bible to do it. Alabama State Auditor Jim Ziegler says of what Moore allegedly did:Take the Bible. Zachariah and Elizabeth for instance. Zachariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist. Also take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus. So, let me get this straight. This guy is saying that what Moore did is A-okay because Jesus. This is insane, even for Republicans. Newsflash, Mr. Ziegler: Roy Moore is no Joseph from the Bible, and that young girl is no Mary. Further, it is absolutely absurd to suggest that a myth from a 2,000 year old holy text is some kind of justification for modern day pedophilia.I swear, these people will do anything to win. Then again, they elected Trump, so all bets are off these days. Here s yet another reason to make sure we take back Congress in 2018, Democrats. Let s bring some decency back to Washington.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2017",0,2095
Trump defends decision to settle Trump University lawsuits,"(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday defended his decision to settle lawsuits over his Trump University real estate seminars for $25 million, saying he does not have time to fight the fraud cases in court now that he is headed to the White House. The lawsuits cast a shadow over the Republican’s presidential campaign and led to one of the more controversial moments of his run for the White House when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of Mexican ancestry.  While denying any wrongdoing, Trump agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle the lawsuits. “I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning.   New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has said over 5,000 students across the country were defrauded out of about $40 million, so Trump’s settlement of $25 million was around 60 percent of these estimated damages.  “The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!” He said in a second tweet. In announcing the settlement, Schneiderman said the deal followed repeated refusals by Trump “to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university.” In a statement, Schneiderman called the settlement a “stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.” Students had claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trump’s real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Trump’s lawyers denied this. The deal covers three lawsuits relating to Trump University: two class actions suits in California and a New York case brought by Schneiderman. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego must still approved the settlement. During his election campaign, Trump said that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trump’s campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control illegal immigration.

"Colombia, ELN rebels agree temporary ceasefire starting Oct. 1","BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia and the Marxist ELN rebel group said on Monday they  agreed a temporary ceasefire that would run through mid-January 2018, but it would not be in effect when Pope Francis arrives in the Andean country for a visit later this week. The ceasefire, the first with the ELN, is due to begin on Oct. 1 and end on Jan. 12, with the possibility for extensions if it is respected, President Juan Manuel Santos said in a televised address to the country.  The priority is to protect citizens, so during this period, kidnappings, attacks on oil pipelines and other hostilities against the civilian population will cease,  he said. The two sides have long said the pope s visit would be a good opportunity to call a ceasefire. The government said details and verification methods were still being finalized and that was why the ceasefire did not begin immediately. The National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group, which has bombed oil installations and kidnapped for ransom, was founded by radical Catholic priests in 1964. The ELN and government are in peace talks, currently being held in Ecuador, to end 53 years of war.   Since the talks began in February, the ELN has continued to take hostages for ransom, launch bomb attacks and extort foreign oil and mining companies. The ELN told Reuters last week that it had killed Russian-Armenian citizen Arsen Voskanyan in April.  The ELN s practice of kidnapping civilians is a key issue at the peace talks.  The ELN told Reuters last week that they were not optimistic a peace agreement could be reached because neither side would give ground on kidnapping. Pope Francis is scheduled to arrive in Colombia on Wednesday evening for a five-day visit to the cities of Bogota, Villavicencio, Medellin and Cartagena. The ELN said in a statement on its website on Monday,  We have said that the visit of Pope Francis should be an extra motivator to accelerate our work for an accord.    Once the days of celebration of the presence of Francis have passed, we will continue to insist on advancing toward the de-escalation of the conflict, until complete peace is a reality.

BREAKING: [VIDEO] Controversial Mayor Who Refused To Allow Sharia Law In Texas City Where Muslim Clock Boy Went To School Explains Why School Can’t Tell Their Side Of Story,"There s always another side that s usually being buried by the mainstream media in order to promote a leftist agenda Media coverage on Ahmed  Bomb-Clock  Mohamed has been remarkably one-sided, with the Mohamed family and the media spinning a tale of Islamophobia and overreaction.However, in an appearance on Glenn Beck s The Blaze TV last night, the mayor of the city where Mohamed goes to school painted a starkly different picture. Among other revelations were her claims that the Mohamed family had stonewalled her and seemed more interested in talking with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and related groups than with city officials.Irving, Texas, Mayor Beth Van Duyne said that, since Mohamed is a juvenile, they cannot release the records of what caused police to arrest him. She says that the family has refused to allow those records to be released, according to Townhall.com. The (Irving) school district, a number of times, has asked the family to release the records, so that you can have the balanced story out there,  Van Duyne said.  The family is ignoring the request from the ISD. The mayor said the records would  help to describe why it progressed as it did. Nobody is going to walk in and say,  Oh you re a 14-year old child, you re totally cooperating, we have all the answers we need, let s arrest you,  Van Duyne said, adding she had information that Mohamed was being  passive aggressive  and  non-responsive  when police questioned him.Van Duyne also noted that the family seemed more interested in seeking press than resolving the issue. We had tried to reach out to the family a number of times; this was before it ever even hit the papers on Wednesday,  Van Duyne said.  At the exact same time they were supposed to be meeting with us, they were on their front lawn with a press conference. Van Duyne also slammed President Barack Obama for jumping the gun on Ahmed Mohamed s case. We never even got a call from anybody at the White House asking to verify any of that information,  Van Duyne said.  I don t think the picture of the hoax bomb was even released before he tweeted  cool clock kid. Van Duyne, adding that Irving officials were receiving death threats because of the case, said that the  teacher was reacting to the device, not the student. If something had happened, and nobody had spoken up, people would be livid,  Van Duyne said.  Can you imagine if you were a parent at ISD and no one said anything?

Trump explained U.S. position on THAAD to Xi: South Korea,"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told South Korea on Saturday he had explained to China’s President Xi Jinping America’s position on the deployment of an anti-missile defense system to South Korea, according to a statement from South Korea’s acting leader. Trump informed South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn in a Saturday telephone call of his summit discussion with Xi. China has opposed the deployment of the U.S.-supplied High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea, arguing it could threaten its security, but South Korea and the United States say it is aimed at countering North Korea’s missile threat.  China has increased pressure and imposed restrictions on some South Korean companies doing business in China, which led many in the South to believe Beijing was retaliating against the deployment of the missile system. “President Trump said he and President Xi held in-depth discussions on the seriousness of North Korea’s nuclear problem and how to respond to it, and also said he had conveyed the U.S. position on the THAAD deployment,” the statement said. Trump pressed Xi to do more to curb North Korea’s nuclear programme in their summit meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. The U.S. military began deployment of the THAAD system in March, a day after the North test-fired four ballistic missiles. China has not directly said it is targeting South Korean companies.

" BUSTED: Trump Running Mate Mike Pence Caught Suppressing Up To 10,000 Black Votes","The math for the election is very simple: The more black voters, the worse the results will be for the Republican Party and the party s presidential nominee, Donald Trump. As a result, the Republicans have a perverse incentive to keep black voter numbers as low as possible.And now it appears that Trump s running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, may be doing his part to emulate the Jim Crow south and bar black voters from being registered.Connie Lawson, the Secretary of State for Indiana, sent a letter to state election officials telling them that Patriot Majority USA, a group trying to register black voters were  nefarious actors  operating in the state. Lawson told officials to snitch to authorities if they received voter registration forms from the group. Combined with state police executing a search warrant against the group, it gave the appearance of vote suppression, according to Craig Varoga, the group s president.The publicity surrounding the actions taken by Lawson and Indiana s state police have cast a shadow over the nonprofits, with many stories accusing them of voter fraud.Varoga said the Oct. 4 police action prevented the group from registering 5,000 to 10,000 additional voters ahead of Indiana s Oct. 11 voter registration deadline. He s worried that clerks won t count some of the 45,000 applications the group had already collected.Republicans, as they often do in election years, have mounted an assault on voter registration drives and mobilization efforts. They have particularly targeted these efforts to minority communities. North Carolina Republicans were recently rebuked by the federal courts when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals declared most of a 2013 law invalid, since documents revealed that it was designed specifically to target minority voters with a voter ID law, and by banning same-day registration, early voting, and out-of-precinct voting.The judge in that case, Diana Gribbon Motz, wrote, The State s very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race specifically its concern that African Americans, who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats, had too much access to the franchise.

U.S. Senate's top tax lawmaker targets corporate offshore profits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate’s senior Democratic tax law writer says he will rip up a root of corporate tax avoidance if his party wins Senate control in November, targeting trillions of dollars in tax-deferred profits being held abroad by U.S. companies. In an interview with Reuters, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden   said he wants to put an end to a Kennedy-era law that lets U.S. corporations indefinitely hold profits from active business operations offshore without paying U.S. tax on them.  Corporate tax avoidance is under trans-Atlantic assault. The EU has slapped a $14.5 billion back-taxes bill on Apple Inc. Ten days ago, the Obama administration imposed another in a series of recent clamp-downs on tax avoidance. The idea of ending tax deferral of foreign profits has been kicked around for years. Wyden, 67, is a long-time proponent and might finally be able to do something about it, if voters support enough Senate Democrats in the Nov. 8 elections. “This is going to be front and center at the beginning of January,” said Wyden, who is the top Democrat on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee. The panel and the full Senate are presently controlled by Republicans. Wyden said his first action, if he becomes chairman, will be to propose a funding package to upgrade U.S. infrastructure. It would require U.S. companies to bring home more than $2 trillion in foreign profits held offshore as part of an international tax reform package. A previous tax “holiday” for profits held offshore was tried in 2004 but was voluntary, not mandatory. Under that program, $360 billion in foreign profits was “repatriated” at a discounted tax rate of 5.25 percent, far below the statutory corporate income tax rate of 35 percent. Wyden has not specified a rate for his proposal. Six years later, with corporations pushing for another such holiday, a congressional committee said the 2004 program had little economic impact and cost the U.S. Treasury about $3.3 billion in lost revenue.  The tax reforms Wyden envisions would also lower corporate tax rates and simplify the convoluted U.S. tax code to prevent tax planners from “gaming” the system. The code has not been thoroughly overhauled in 30 years. “The first bill out of the gate would be roads and bridges and transportation,” Wyden told Reuters on Friday. “My sense is that there will be an interest among members in using a portion of the money derived from international reform for the roads and bridges and transportation systems.” Most multinationals and many lawmakers, both Republicans and some Democrats, favor a foreign profit repatriation program, but not like the one Wyden wants.  The United States has a “worldwide” corporate income tax system that taxes profits of U.S. companies no matter where they are made, with some exceptions. One is that earnings from active business operations, as opposed to passive income such as rent or royalties, can be left offshore on a tax-free basis under the Kennedy-era deferral rule. Passive income is taxed. In contrast, most large countries have “territorial” systems in which companies pay income tax only to the government of the country where the profits were made. Corporate America has been lobbying for many years for a territorial system that would make deferral obsolete. Wyden and other Democrats want to keep a worldwide system and eliminate deferral, a position singled out for criticism last week by House Speaker Paul Ryan.  “The fear I have is the progressives who kind of control the Democratic Party don’t think anything close to what looks like tax reform is a good thing,” Ryan told the Economic Club of New York. “I hope that view changes.” But Wyden says the public is unlikely to accept a system under which U.S. corporations do not pay taxes on foreign profits. “At a time when Americans are so angry about jobs being shipped overseas... I don’t think it’s going to go over very well,” he said. “A competitive rate, no deferral and no gaming, I’m going to argue gets you the benefit of territorial.” Some Republicans also oppose tying tax reform to infrastructure. Wyden says failing to reform the tax code could strain U.S. relations with the European Union, if EU state aid probes continue to penalize U.S. companies, possibly resulting in U.S. action before the World Trade Organization. “To Democrats and Republicans, this feels more like the European Commission declaring open season on the American tax base than (them) joining us to fight tax dodgers,” he said. “I could see members saying the United States should respond with a WTO case,” Wyden added. “There’s that kind of anger.” ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1,4704

LOL! SHAKEDOWN ARTIST JESSE JACKSON TELLS CROWD: “President Trump Would Not Qualify To Get Into Jesus’ Kingdom” [VIDEO],"Here s a 1999 video of Jesse Jackson praising Donald Trump for his contribution to the black community, awarding him with a lifetime achievement award for African Americans:What a difference a few years (and an [R] behind your name can make:WFB   While speaking to a crowd at the  Ministers March for Justice  Rev. Jesse Jackson suggested that President Trump should be worried about gaining citizenship in heaven. Trump says you must be able to speak the language of English, [be] qualified, and have a job skill,  Jackson said Monday.  Jesus would not qualify to come in Trump s country he would not qualify to get into Jesus  kingdom. It s difficult to understand Jackson in the video below, as he mumbles through much of his commentary. (For translation, see quotes above):The  Ministers March for Justice,  was spearheaded by Rev. Al Sharpton and featured ministers from various traditions united in opposing the Trump administration. The event took place on the 54th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. s March on Washington, and Jackson did not shy away from using religious language to judge the president.After judging Trump s ability to enter heaven, he quoted part of a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus says what he will tell his followers at the Final Judgment.Is the notorious shake down artist Jesse Jackson really one to be deciding who will and who will not be given admittance to heaven? In 2006, government watchdog Judicial Watch released a report that revealed new details about the intimidation and shakedown tactics of Jesse Jackson s Rainbow Push Coalition.WND   The report,  Jesse Jackson Exposed,  claims Jackson is  an extortionist who uses his influence as a civil rights leader to essentially blackmail wealthy corporations with absurd discrimination threats. Included, the group says, are  incriminating admissions from Jackson made under oath at trial. Among the tactics highlighted in the report are:Jackson lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to block companies seeking government approval to merge until they donate money to Rainbow Push.Jackson publicly chastised Toyota for running an ad Jackson deemed  racist.  After Toyota pulled the ad, Jackson threatened a boycott the automaker to force it to launch a $7.8 million  diversity program. Jackson installed one of his friends, J.L. Armstrong, in a management position at Toyota to determine which organizations would receive $700 million in contracts awarded by Toyota.Minority businesses pay Jackson s  Trade Bureau  a fee to help extort lucrative contracts from corporations. During the trial, Jackson compared the Trade Bureau to  Noah s Ark,  claiming minority businesses and organizations had to be inside the  ark  to survive. Judicial Watch brought the lawsuit against Jackson, his son Jonathan Jackson and Rainbow Push Coalition on behalf of Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, a black minister and founder of the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Organization for a New Destiny.Peterson wrote a book titled,  Scam,  that takes Jackson to task as one of America s  self-appointed  black leaders. I don t recall the entire black race in this country taking a national vote to elect Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan, the NAACP, California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus or liberal black preachers as our leaders,  Peterson writes,  yet they ve seized the mantle of leadership and claim to speak for all blacks in this nation. Another expose of Jackson, Kenneth Timmerman s book  Shakedown: Exposing the real Jesse Jackson,  goes back several decades, including his ordination as a reverend. I describe a two to three year process for earning that title,  Timmerman said.  Jesse Jackson got himself ordained two months after Martin Luther King was shot. It was essentially a  political ordination,  a  shotgun ordination.  He did not go through the long procedure. He was not licensed to preach, as far as I could determine. I went to the church where he was ordained. He did not go through this two-year process. He never submitted himself to the authority of the church. He has never had a church himself, and he has been accountable to no one.  Timmerman asserts Jackson  is not doing things to help the black community. Jesse Jackson is   to help himself first.

BREAKING NEWS: GENERAL MATTIS Issues Fiery Warning To N. Korea’s Kim Jong Un…STAND DOWN Or Face “End of Its Regime…Destruction of Its People”,"President Trump put North Korea s brutal dictator on notice yesterday, warning Kim Jong Un that North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States   they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen .President Trump sent this message on Twitter this morning. He was clearly letting the world know we are not planning to allow North Korea to threaten  the most powerful nation in the world : Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017The Korean People s Army responded to Trump s warning by saying the strike plan would be  put into practice in a multi-current and consecutive way any moment . They went on to say, The KPA strategic force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the US major military bases on Guam, including the Andersen Air Force base,  said the KPA, referring to a missile it first tested in May. US strategic bombers  threaten and blackmail [North Korea] through their frequent visits to the sky above South Korea , the KPA added.  It is a daydream for the US to think that its mainland is an invulnerable heavenly kingdom. Today, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis weighed in, as he issued a fiery warning to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, urging him to put an end to any  actions that would lead to the end  of the rogue regime  and the destruction of its people. The DPRK must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,  Mattis said in a statement.  The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people. He went on to say that President Trump since before taking office has been fully aware of the threat that North Korea s nuclear and missile programs pose. President Trump was informed of the growing threat last December and on taking office his first orders to me emphasized the readiness of our ballistic missile defense and nuclear deterrent forces,  Mattis continued.  While our State Department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth. The DPRK regime s actions will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates.  MRCTV",politics,"Aug 9, 2017",0,2767

"Kremlin, angry at Syria missile strike, says Putin won't meet Tillerson","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will not meet President Vladimir Putin when he visits Moscow on Wednesday, a move that could point to tensions over a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian air base last week. John Kerry, Tillerson’s predecessor, often met Putin as well as the Russian foreign minister when he visited Moscow, and Putin granted several audiences to the Texan when he ran oil major Exxon Mobil before taking his current job. Putin even personally awarded Tillerson a top Russian state award — the Order of Friendship — in 2013, and it was widely expected that the former oilman would meet Putin on what is his first trip to Russia as secretary of state. But Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Monday that no such meeting was planned, suggesting Tillerson will follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. “We have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president’s diary,” Peskov told reporters on a conference call. He did not say why Putin was not planning to receive Tillerson. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian military base last week in retaliation for what Washington and its allies say was a poisonous gas attack in which scores of civilians were killed. Moscow says there is no proof that the Syrian military carried out the attack, and called the U.S. missile strike an act of aggression that violates international law.   Tillerson’s visit is being seen as an early test of whether Trump’s new administration can use any momentum generated by striking the Syrian base to craft and execute a strategy to end the war there. Even before Trump ordered the strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, Tillerson’s visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues. Those include alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Washington’s accusation that Russia is violating an important arms control treaty, and trying to bridge differences on how to conduct the fight against Islamic State. Syria, ironically, was one of the few areas where analysts believed Moscow and Washington might be able to find common ground. Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said on Monday that the U.S. strikes had shown Washington’s total unwillingness to cooperate on Syria. Reacting to media reports that Tillerson would use his visit to press Moscow to back away from supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia’s biggest Middle East ally, Peskov signaled that was a non-starter. “Returning to pseudo-attempts to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out.” ",politicsNews,"April 10, 2017 ",1,2823
"EU plans Brexit summit gesture, May hints on cash","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain will be offered a goodwill gesture at a European Union summit next week, European nations agreed on Friday, seeking to break the deadlock over Brexit, but no watering down of their demand for tens of billions of euros they say Britain owes. British Prime Minister Theresa May also indicated she might make a move at next week s summit. A spokeswoman said  there will be more to say there  on a promise May made last month to honor financial commitments when Britain leaves. Both sides are making the moves to end an apparent stalemate in talks on Britain s leaving the EU.  At heart is a proposal by summit chair Donald Tusk to tell May next week that the EU will start internal work on a post-Brexit transition plan.  This is a very big gesture towards Britain, maybe way too big,  a senior EU diplomat said ahead of an evening meeting of envoys from the 27 remaining states to discuss Tusk s draft for a statement to made after leaders meet in a week s time. Ambassadors broadly agreed the plan on Friday despite scepticism, including from powerhouse Germany. They requested some harder language to ram home that any offer is conditional on Britain making progress toward agreeing Brussels  terms.  Time is running out , German Chancellor Angela Merkel s spokesman had warned after week of stalemate in negotiations and faction-fighting within May s government that have raised concerns that talks could collapse, leaving Britain bumping out into legal limbo in March 2019. Hammering the point, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said in Luxembourg:  They have to pay. They have to pay.  Underscoring tensions, British finance minister Philip Hammond referred to the EU as  the enemy  at one point, but then apologized. His remark came as he defended himself against accusations from hardline Brexit supporters who say he is soft on Brussels. Businesses planning investment decisions are calling for a clear idea by the new year of how the split and subsequent years of transition to a new trade relationship will function. Otherwise, some firms say, they may assume a disruptive  hard Brexit  and move some operations to continental Europe. As the process approaches the half-way stage between last June s referendum vote for Brexit and Britain s departure on March 30, 2019, tensions are building not just between the two negotiating sides but also within the bloc of 27. While hardliners would prefer less or no talk of a future after Brexit and more about demanding money, others are keen to give May, beleaguered at home, something to show for the effort to compromise she displayed in a speech at Florence last month. One diplomat called the draft a  search and rescue mission  to help the British premier out of a jam. Another said it was a bid to break  stalemate  and avert  disaster  over the winter:  Some states were not very happy about this but what else can we do?  the diplomat added.  We are trying to reach out.  But then the diplomat added:  They must come up with something on the money.  Diplomats said Germany and France coordinated on Friday , to limit any watering down of the EU position that its negotiator, Michel Barnier, cannot so much as mention to his British counterparts what might come after Brexit until leaders deem there has been  sufficient progress  on three issues the EU says must be settled before Britain leaves. These are the rights of EU citizens in Britain, Northern Ireland s new EU border and the intractable  Brexit bill . Tusk, who met Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in a week when he has spoken to almost all other EU leaders including May, offered a draft text saying there is not enough progress but welcoming the advances there have been and flagging a hope that the next summit in December could open trade talks. In its strongest conclusion, it proposes that Barnier start working out internally - without negotiating with London - what will happen after Brexit. Barnier himself has sought flexibility to break the deadlock, diplomats say.  If this is the concession May needs to be able to make a move on financial settlement, let s try it,  said a diplomat from one of Britain s close EU trading partners.  She is so weak at the moment she can do nothing. And we need the money.  Despite protestations of unity, some diplomats detect nuance in approaches to the prospect of talks collapsing, with those countries with most to lose from trade barriers with Britain most keen to avert a meltdown. Essentially that means its near neighbors like the Nordic states, the Netherlands and Ireland. ",worldnews,"October 13, 2017 ",1,4645
Turkey detains 54 former university staff in Gulen-related operation: Anadolu,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police have detained 54 staff from a university shut down after an attempted coup last year that was blamed on U.S.-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday. It said the police had arrest warrants for a total of 171 academics and staff from Istanbul s former Fatih University, which was regarded as having close ties to Gulen. The cleric has denied any involvement in the failed putsch of July 15, 2016. Fatih University was shut under a state decree following the coup attempt and Anadolu said staff there were found to have been users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging application which the government says was commonly used by Gulen s supporters. Since the coup attempt more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs. Rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which has Turkey faced since the putsch, in which 250 people were killed. ",worldnews,"December 27, 2017 ",1,1213
 WATCH: The NRA Just Got Caught Desecrating A National Cemetery For Political Gain,"The NRA claims to care about our military veterans but they just got busted desecrating a military cemetery by filming an anti-Hillary campaign ad without permission.The 30 second ad shows Benghazi attack survivor Mark Geist casually walking through the grave markers of our deceased military veterans in the midst of dramatic fear-inducing music as he openly blames Hillary Clinton for the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. consulate in Libya in September 2012. A lot of people say they aren t going to vote this November because their candidate didn t win,  Geist began before pointing out that millions of veterans won t be voting this year because they are dead.  Well, I know some other people who won t be voting this year either. Hillary as president   no thanks,  he continues.  I served in Benghazi. My friends didn t make it. They did their part. Do yours. The $2 million ad campaign then goes on to urge people to vote for Donald Trump.Here s the video via YouTube.As you can see, Geist is clearly being filmed inside of a national cemetery where filming is prohibited by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In order to film a commercial at such a sacred venue requires permission, which the NRA didn t bother to seek because they knew they wouldn t get it. That s because their campaign ad is obviously partisan and is using the graves of dead soldiers to attack a political opponent.VA spokesman James Hutton condemned the ad and confirmed that the NRA did not seek nor did they receive permission. The National Cemetery Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs has not received or approved any filming requests of this nature. NCA did not receive a request from the NRA to film the subject advertisement. If we had received such a request, we would have denied it based on the partisan content. Our veterans, their families and survivors are our top priority. To maintain the sanctity and decorum of VA National Cemeteries as national shrines, our filming policy states that filming may not be used for the expression of partisan or political viewpoints, or for uses that are (or may be interpreted as) an endorsement of a commercial entity. In short, the NRA disgraced this country and themselves by using the graves of our fallen heroes in their political witch hunt against Hillary Clinton. And this comes in the wake of House Republicans ending their four year long Benghazi investigation which failed to find any evidence that Clinton is to blame for the attack.Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the family of Ambassador Chris Stevens, who also died in Benghazi that day, do not hold Hillary Clinton responsible for the attack. In fact, they say the  underlying cause  for the lack of security is the way Republicans have slashed security funding for U.S. embassies and diplomatic personnel in the years prior to the attack. Perhaps if Congress had provided a budget to increase security for all missions around the world, then some of the requests for more security in Libya would have been granted,  said Dr. Anne Stevens, the sister of Ambassador Stevens.  Certainly the State Department is underbudgeted. I do not blame Hillary Clinton or [former CIA Director] Leon Panetta. They were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world. And their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had. This is a sick campaign ad by the NRA and they should be ashamed of themselves for sinking to this depth in what is obviously a desperation play because they know their Republican nominee is getting his ass handed to him in the polls. If anything, this violation of the sanctity of the final resting place of many veterans, many of whom were probably not Republicans or members of the NRA, should enrage every American who claims to give a damn about the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The NRA disrespected sacred ground and that cannot go unpunished.Featured image via screen capture",News,"June 29, 2016",0,4096

Relatives of Wallenberg filed a lawsuit against Russia s Federal Security Service (FSB), seeking access to uncensored documents which they said could provide clues to Wallenberg s fate.

U.S. Senate confirms Trump trade representative ahead of NAFTA talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. Trade Representative, a critical position ahead of renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Delays in Senate confirmation of veteran trade lawyer Robert Lighthizer more than 100 days after his nomination have set back Trump’s trade agenda, including the start of talks about revamping one of the world’s biggest trading blocs. Lighthizer won support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Republican-led Senate on Thursday, with an 82-14 vote to confirm his nomination.   The administration has had to wait for Lighthizer to be in place before triggering the formal process to begin renegotiating NAFTA.  It was not immediately clear when the White House would begin that process. To do so, the Trump administration must send a letter to Congress declaring its intention to launch  negotiations in 90 days. The Republican president has said the 23-year-old trade pact devastated U.S. workers and has vowed to tear it up if he fails to get a better deal.  Some Democrats, while critical of Trump’s views on trade, said they were confident Lighthizer would work to help U.S. workers. “He’s a real pro,” Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said before voting in favor. Lighthizer’s approval came despite the objections of two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said they were worried he did not appreciate NAFTA’s benefits. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, in charge of trade ties with the United States, said she did not expect the administration would move immediately on NAFTA. “I imagine that Ambassador Lighthizer may need to spend a bit of time in consultations prior to formally triggering that 90-day period,” she said on a conference call on Thursday night.      While the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico has ballooned since NAFTA was enacted in 1994, U.S. farmers have profited from exports to America’s southern neighbor, while automakers have cut costs by building cross-border supply chains that benefit from lower Mexican wages.  Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee and voted in favor of Lighthizer’s nomination, also urged the incoming trade representative not to put at risk the gains NAFTA had brought.  “There are definitely opportunities to update and improve NAFTA,” Hatch said. “But it is important that the administration follow the spirit of the Hippocratic oath: First do no harm.” ",politicsNews,"May 11, 2017 ",1,2611

I can say that at this time it would be unlikely to find someone alive,  Puente said in an interview, referring to 43 missing people being sought at four disaster sites in Mexico City.      The 7.1 magnitude quake struck one week ago, killing 326 people including 187 people in Mexico City, damaging 11,000 homes, of which about 1,500 will need to be demolished, Puente said. About 10 percent of damaged buildings were constructed after strict building codes were enacted in the wake of the devastating 1985 earthquake that killed an estimated 10,000 people, Puente said, leading officials on Monday to instruct prosecutors to open investigations.  The Mexico City mayor and the national government have already ordered judicial investigations to determine who was responsible for new construction that did not meet the requirements,  Puente said from Civil Protection headquarters, where a roomful of technicians monitored seismic activity and tropical storms on an array of screens. A school that collapsed in southern Mexico City, killing 19 children and seven adults, will be among the subjects of the investigations, Puente said. Officials who approved the school building, the construction company and the owner of the property all could be held accountable if any violations are discovered, Puente said. The largest search and rescue effort was under way at an office building in the Roma section of Mexico City where 40 people may be buried, based on families who have reported their relatives missing, Puente said. A person was believed missing at each of three other buildings in the capital where search operations are in progress, Puente said. Dogs trained to pick up the scent of survivors have yet to find any signs of life at the search sites, he said. Asked how mucher longer search and rescue operations would continue, Punete said,  As of today, we have agreed to another 72 hours.  ",worldnews,"September 26, 2017 ",1,2522
"Defense Secretary Mattis promises support to Ukraine, says reviewing lethal aid","KIEV (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on a visit to Ukraine on Thursday said Washington would keep up pressure on Russia over what he called its aggressive behavior and signaled his personal support for providing weapons to Kiev. Mattis said Russia had not abided by the Minsk ceasefire agreement meant to end the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and that the United States would maintain sanctions on Moscow.    Despite Russia s denials, we know they are seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free nations of Europe,  Mattis told reporters, alongside Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Mattis s visit, timed for Ukrainian Independence Day, is the second high-profile show of U.S. support in as many months, after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson came to Kiev in July.    Ukraine has counted on U.S. support against Russia since a pro-Western government took power following street protests in 2014 when the Kremlin-backed president fled the country. But some of President Donald Trump s comments during the election campaign last year, such as appearing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia, stoked fears in Kiev that Trump might mend ties with Moscow at Ukraine s expense. While emphasizing Trump had yet to take a decision on the issue, Mattis signaled his personal support for a longstanding Ukrainian request for defensive weapons, which could include anti-tank Javelin missiles and anti-aircaft systems. Mattis also played down fears, voiced by the previous White House administration under Barack Obama, that supplying weapons could escalate the situation.   On the defensive lethal weapons, we are actively reviewing it, I will go back now having seen the current situation and be able to inform the secretary of state and the president in very specific terms what I recommend for the direction ahead,  Mattis said.  Defensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor since it is their own territory where the fighting is happening,  Mattis said. Poroshenko said he was  satisfied  with the progress on discussions about weapons, and also said he and Mattis had discussed the possibility of a U.N.-backed armed force being sent to eastern Ukraine. Relations between Ukraine and Russia went into freefall after Moscow s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people. Russia denies sending troops and weapons to eastern Ukraine.  According to U.S. officials, a plan to provide defensive weapons to Ukraine has made its way to the White House but has not been signed. Thus far the Pentagon says it has provided $750 million in non-lethal aid to Ukraine since 2015, which includes radars and uniforms. Supplying weapons  will be a huge boost of support to Ukraine,  said Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the region. Carpenter said the weapons under discussion cannot effectively be used to take territory, which means providing them would help stabilize the situation. U.S. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, also pressed the Trump administration to act.   Secretary Mattis  visit to Kiev provides yet another opportunity for the United States to correct its policy toward Ukraine and provide the lethal defensive assistance the country needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,  McCain said in a statement on Wednesday.  Mattis  strong words against Moscow on Thursday are likely to reassure eastern European allies who are concerned about Russia s military activity in region, including planned war games in September. Russia and Belarus aim to hold joint exercises that some North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies believe could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013. Earlier this year, Estonia s defense minister said Russia may use the exercises to move thousands of troops permanently into Belarus in a warning to NATO. Russia has dismissed Western worries about the war games as  buffoonery . ",worldnews,"August 24, 2017 ",1,4279
Italy's former PM Renzi loses more allies as election nears,"ROME (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose Democratic Party (PD) is shedding support in opinion polls, suffered a further setback on Wednesday when two allies said they would not contest next year s election. Renzi quit as prime minister a year ago after losing a referendum on his planned constitutional reforms. He aims to return to power at the vote due by May, but the PD has split under his leadership and his prospects seem to be dwindling. On Wednesday Giuliano Pisapia, a former mayor of Milan, announced that his small leftist party, called The Progressive Camp (CP), which had been expected to join forces with the PD at the election, was disbanding. Pisapia said it had proved  impossible to continue talks with the PD , and complained in particular about Renzi s unwillingness to push through a contested law making it easier for the children of immigrants to obtain Italian citizenship. Hours later, Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, leader of the centrist Popular Alternative party (AP) which governs with the PD, said he would not be running at the election, throwing into doubt the future of the party he founded.  The CP and AP have less than 3 percent of the vote each, according to opinion polls, but the latest defections weaken the center-left in which a declining PD is now virtually without any allies.  The left and the PD are crumbling away,  said Renato Brunetta, lower house leader of Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party which is the lynchpin of a center-right alliance that is expected to win most seats at the election. On Sunday, leftist parties which had already quit the PD joined forces under the leadership of Senate Speaker Piero Grasso to form Free and Equal, a new grouping already credited with around 6 percent of the vote and expected to grow further at the expense of the PD.     Posing a potential further headache for Renzi, a parliamentary commission on banking decided later on Wednesday to call a former top banker who a prominent journalist alleged had been put under pressure by a close ally in his government. In a book published earlier this year, the previous director of one of Italy s biggest newspapers said Renzi s reform minister Maria Elena Boschi had in 2015 asked Federico Ghizzoni, then chief executive of UniCredit, to look into buying a struggling bank where her father held a senior position. The cross-party commission investigating banking crises said in a statement it had voted unanimously to call Ghizzoni to speak. A source said his hearing would be held by Dec. 23. Boschi, who is now cabinet secretary, denies ever asking anyone to buy Banca Etruria, which was eventually rescued by the state. She said this week she was taking legal action.     Renzi s PD critics say he has dragged the traditionally left-leaning party to the right and lament what they say is his autocratic, domineering leadership style.    The party has been steadily losing support since it won over 40 percent of the vote at European elections in 2014. Surveys suggest it would now poll around 25 percent, some 3 points behind the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. The center-right bloc is made up of Forza Italia and the anti-immigrant Northern League, each with around 15 percent, and the right-wing Brothers of Italy, on around 5 percent. While the center-right is seen winning most seats at the election, opinion polls suggest it will not win an absolute majority, making a hung parliament the most likely outcome.

Popular Michelle Obama courts young people for Clinton,"FAIRFAX, Va. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign deployed a popular surrogate on Friday to gin up enthusiasm amid young voters who could be critical to victory on Nov. 8: Michelle Obama. The U.S. first lady and wife of President Barack Obama, who won the White House in 2008 and 2012 with high levels of support from young voters, told a crowd of students in Virginia that they could mean the difference between a Clinton win or a loss to Republican nominee Donald Trump. “Let’s be clear, elections aren’t just about who votes, but who doesn’t vote. And that is especially true for young people like all of you,” she said, noting that voters under the age of 30 provided the margin of victory for Obama in the swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Virginia in 2012. “Without those votes, Barack would have lost those states and he definitely would have lost that election. Period, end of story,” she said. A New York Times/CBS poll this week showed Clinton with more support from people under 30 than Trump but still well below the levels Obama achieved.  Though she has not yet been a frequent presence on the 2016 campaign trail, Mrs. Obama has proven to be an especially powerful advocate for Clinton, her husband’s one-time rival. Her speech in support of Clinton at the Democratic convention in July was praised as one of the best of that event. “I’m inspired,” she said, listing Clinton’s positions in public service and rejecting arguments that Clinton was not an inspiring figure. The current first lady praised the former first lady as one of the most qualified people for the office of president in history. “So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because here is what we know: that being president isn’t anything like reality TV,”  Mrs. Obama said, referring to Trump, a former reality television host. A president could not just “pop off” when making life or death decisions about war and peace, she said without naming Trump.   Mrs. Obama noted that the country was in a time of transition, just like her family, which was about to move into a new house. She joked that they had to make sure the White House was cleaned up so they could get their security deposit back. Then she referred to the transition in 2008 with a dig at Trump for questioning whether Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. On Friday he finally conceded that Obama was U.S. born. “There were those who questioned, and continued to question for the past eight years, up through this very day, whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said to boos. “I think Barack has answered those questions with the example he’s set: by going high when they go low.”  ",politicsNews,"September 16, 2016 ",1,2793
China says it respects Mugabe's decision to resign,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday that it respects Robert Mugabe s decision to resign as Zimbabwe s president, a week after the African country s army and Mugabe s former political allies moved to end his four decades of rule. The 93-year-old Mugabe had clung on for a week after an army takeover, and finally resigned on Tuesday, moments after parliament began an impeachment process, prompting dancing in the streets of the capital, Harare.  China has close ties with Zimbabwe and traditionally also with Mugabe himself, who is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa s most promising states. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing that China was happy to see Zimbabwe peacefully and appropriately resolve the issue via talks, and that its policy toward the country would not change.  China respects Mr Mugabe s decision to resign. He remains a good friend of the Chinese people,  Lu said, adding that Mugabe had made  historic contribution to Zimbabwe s independence and liberation . Zimbabwe s army seized power after Mugabe sacked his former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was a favorite to succeed him.  Mugabe s move was an apparent bid to smooth a path to the presidency for his wife Grace, 52, known to her critics as  Gucci Grace  for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping. Mnangagwa is expected to be sworn in within days and serve the remainder of Mugabe s term until the next election, which must be held by September 2018. Asked about a U.S. call for free elections in Zimbabwe, Lu said China believed it could handle its own affairs and China hoped other countries would not interfere.  China and Zimbabwe have a close diplomatic and economic relationship, and China had stood with Mugabe s government in the face of Western economic sanctions, investing in auto, diamond, tobacco and power-station projects. In August, Zimbabwe said a Chinese company planned to invest up to $2 billion to revive operations at Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), which ceased production in 2008 at the height of an economic meltdown.  That year, China vetoed a proposed Western-backed U.N. resolution that would have imposed an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on Mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate , rather than ease, conflict.

Transgender military personnel sue Trump over service ban,"(Reuters) - Five transgender members of the U.S. military including Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans sued President Donald Trump on Wednesday, challenging his ban on transgender people serving in the armed forces. Trump said on Twitter on July 26 that the U.S. government “will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity” in the military, a reversal of Pentagon policy that the lawsuit said was made without consulting senior military commanders. The surprise announcement, citing healthcare costs and unit disruption, appealed to some in Trump’s conservative political base but created uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the Pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly.  Trump’s tweets appeared to dismiss findings from a RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon that found allowing transgender people to serve would “cost little and have no significant impact on unit readiness.” The White House and the Pentagon said they do not comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The service members suing the president are three U.S. Army soldiers, one U.S. Air Force airman and one member of the U.S. Coast Guard who are active duty. All have come out as transgender to their commanding officers but are anonymous in the lawsuit, named only as Jane Doe, for fear of retribution, said Jennifer Levi, a lawyer from GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. The group filed the lawsuit along with the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was preparing its own lawsuit. The lawsuit said Trump’s tweets violate the rights of the service members to due process and equal protection under the law. It asks the court to declare Trump’s directive as unconstitutional and to issue injunctions to stop it. The defendants are listed as Trump, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other military leaders including Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford said in a memo a day after Trump’s tweets that there would be no change in policy until Mattis received an official order from the president. That order has yet to be issued. “In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,” Dunford said. Lawyer Levi said the plaintiffs, some of whom are near retirement, need not wait for an official policy because the tweets alone created uncertainty about their futures.

OBAMA HID BIN LADEN PAPERS To Bury This Damning Evidence That Could Have Cost Him 2012 Election,"The Obama administration s well guarded Osama bin Laden documents were released on Wednesday by CIA director Mike Pompeo. The documents were seized in a raid after U.S. SEAL Rob O Neill killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand-picked just a few of the 470,000 documents to release. They hid damning evidence that could have hurt Obama s chance at reelection in 2012 .OBAMA RAN THE CLOCK OUT AL QAEDA WAS NOT  ON THE RUN :Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard:  In a manner of speaking, Barack Obama wanted what al Qaeda already had: a mutually beneficial partnership with Tehran. Revealing to the American people the truth about Osama bin Laden s cozy working relationship with the Iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest, just as the ongoing vitality of al Qaeda, amply testified to in the bin Laden documents, would have contradicted Obama s proud claims in 2012 that al Qaeda was  on the run.  So Obama, with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community, bottled up the bin Laden documents and ran out the clock.IRAN S CLOSE TIES TO AL QAEDA COULD HURT THE IRAN DEAL:Within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al Qaeda   Tehran ties: how Iran supplied  everything needed,  including  money, arms  and  training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon,  including safe haven for other jihadis, the New York Post reported.The assessment is raising questions as to how much then-President Obama knew about Iran s ties to al Qaeda before making his controversial deal. And it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key.The Obama White House had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons. Bin Laden had called Iran a  main artery for funds, personnel and communication  for al Qaeda, the Post reported.That wasn t the only suspicious dealing Obama had with Iran. In August 2016, Republicans were furious over a reported deal Obama had made to release American hostages in Iran.The former administration denied paying $400 million in  ransom  for the hostages, arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long-standing case. However, it was only the first of three payments to the Iranians totaling $1.3 billion that took place after the hostage release, as the Wall Street Journal disclosed. And strikingly, much of the case came by way of plane-loads of cash in international currencies.But the revelations about bin Laden and the former administration don t end there.MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO BIN LADEN:In one of the 10,000 videos files contained within the newly released documents, bin Laden is asked to name is his influences. The terrorist leader didn t hesitate, The National reported. From a religious aspect, I was committed within the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden also suggested the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi. It was the first time I travelled to a country where I did not know the language,  he writes.  I carried a pistol and went. The Brotherhood, they had poor knowledge about things. If they knew, I would not have had to travel through Syria to Antakya 12 hours by bus to reach Istanbul. It was easier from Jeddah to Istanbul by plane. Three hours by plane. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO CLINTONS:Critics of the Muslim Brotherhood have long warned of its terror affiliation and infiltration into the West. One Brotherhood official Gehad el-Haddad was arrested two years ago in Cairo for inciting violence. El-Haddad (pictured below) previously worked as an executive for the Clinton Foundation.

 Trump Will Spend More Taxpayer Money On Vacations In A Year Than Obama Did In Eight,"If Donald Trump continues to travel to Mar-a-Lago in Florida at the current pace, he ll spend more taxpayer dollars on vacations than President Obama ever did.Throughout President Obama s eight years in office, conservatives constantly complained every time he went on vacation or played golf. They whined that it was a waste of money and that Obama was lazy.In total, President Obama took 28 vacations spanning 217 days, which cost a total of $90 million.It should be noted that despite conservative bitching, President Obama took less vacation days than his Republican predecessor. George W. Bush took 88 vacations spanning over 500 days.And Donald Trump is going to surpass both of them very quickly.Only days after the election, Trump indicated that he intends to spend most of his weekends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida where he also has a golf course. He also wants to spend lots of time at Trump Tower in New York and his golf course in New Jersey.Trump has already taken three trips to Mar-a-Lago since taking office four weeks ago and those three trips alone cost taxpayers $10 million.Assuming that Trump keeps up this routine and pace, he will end up taking 39 trips to Mar-a-Lago in 2017 at a whopping cost of $130 million to taxpayers, which means Trump will outspend President Obama within a single year. Furthermore, Trump would easily surpass Obama s number of vacation days. At the current pace, he would end up taking 320 vacations days in four years, and that s not counting other vacations Trump may end up taking. If he starts going to Florida every weekend he would surpass 400 days. And if he plays golf every time he goes to Mar-a-Lago he will have played more rounds of golf in two years than than President Obama did during his first term.If Trump does this every year, the cost to taxpayers will be a monstrous $520 million after four years. That s right, over half a billion dollars.Trump supporters and conservatives will argue that Trump is working during his vacations, but President Obama worked during his vacations, too, yet conservatives never stopped whining about his vacations.And just because Trump might be working a little during his vacations, it doesn t justify the cost to taxpayers. And with all the chaos Trump is causing across the nation and around the world, he shouldn t be going on vacation at all right now.Russia is getting more aggressive. North Korea is firing missiles. America is on course for a major confrontation with China. Millions of Americans are about to lose their healthcare. Immigrants are being rounded up. And America s creditors are dumping us because Trump has made investment here too much of a risk. Chaos and infighting plague the White House. Yet Trump is going on lavish vacations to his Florida estate on the taxpayer s dime while he makes everyone else suffer.It s outrageous and conservatives are hypocrites if they defend Trump.Featured image via Ian MacNicol/Getty Images",News,"February 18, 2017",0,3055
RUSH LIMBAUGH Tells His Own Theory Of The Lynch/Clinton Meet Up,"Rush Limbaugh weighed in on what he thinks happened when Bill clinton met up with AG Loretta Lynch for 30 minutes at the Phoenix airport. The big question to ask in all this is what does Lynch mean by primarily? Doesn t she incriminate herself by opening up the possibility that there could have been conversation about the case before her that involves Hillary Clinton? According to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, her seemingly impromptu meeting with former President Bill Clinton earlier this week was  primarily social,  but conservative talker Rush Limbaugh isn t convinced. I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving, and he spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,  Lynch told Phoenix news outlet KNXV-TV Monday.  Our conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren. It was primarily social, about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix. Radio talk show host and conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh speaks at  An Evenining With Rush Limbaugh  event May 3, 2007 in Novi, Michigan. The event was sponsored by WJR radio station as part of their 85th birthday celebration festivities.But Limbaugh feels a few too many things lined up for the meeting, which has been criticized given the fact Lynch is overseeing an investigation into Hillary Clinton s private email server, to be a spontaneous social call. So Clinton just happens to be told that Loretta Lynch is arriving soon when he just happens to be arriving to depart at Sky Harbor International Airport?  Limbaugh asked during his radio show Thursday.  [W]e are supposed to believe here that Bill Clinton, a 70-year-old man with a history of heart trouble, played golf in Phoenix where it was 108, 110 degrees? Limbaugh doesn t seem to buy Lynch s recanting of the meeting. Instead, he feels the discussion   which the radio personality believes was intended to be clandestine   involved Bill Clinton blackmailing Lynch, telling her to drop the email issue all together. During his program, Limbaugh posed another possibility, in which Bill Clinton praised the attorney general and reminded her he  was one of the people that told Barack Obama to put you in this job,  adding that he s been one of her  champions  for  I can t tell you how long.

Former Salvadoran president Calderon dies at 69,"SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Former Salvadoran President Armando Calderon, who helped oversee the Central American country s transition from a bloody civil war to peace in the 1990s, has died at the age of 69 after a battle with cancer, his family said on Monday. Calderon, who was president from 1994 to 1999 as the reconstruction of the divided country took hold, died around midnight in a hospital in Houston where he was admitted in critical condition with an undisclosed form of cancer. El Salvador s 1980-1992 civil war, which pitted a U.S.-backed right-wing government against the leftist guerilla Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), claimed some 75,000 lives and left around another 8,000 people missing. A founder of the powerful, right-wing  Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), Calderon as president ushered in a string of business-friendly economic reforms including a privatization of the telecoms sector and the pension system. El Salvador s Supreme Court of Justice in 2016 ordered an investigation into Calderon s fortune on suspicion of illicit enrichment. The former president, who was also mayor of San Salvador between 1988 and 1994, rejected the accusations. ",worldnews,"October 9, 2017 ",1,1241
U.S. judge to lift house arrest for former Trump campaign manager Manafort,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge on Friday said she would release former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort from house arrest once he meets certain conditions, expressing satisfaction that the $10 million he agreed to forfeit would be available if he ever failed to appear for court proceedings. In her order, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said to be released from home confinement, Manafort must execute documents agreeing to forfeit four properties, including two in New York, one in Alexandria, Virginia, and his Florida home.    He will be subject to restrictions including a curfew and electronic GPS monitoring but will be allowed to leave his home in Alexandria for his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, once he meets the conditions.  Manafort is charged with conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of the government of Ukraine’s former pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych.  He is being prosecuted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of Mueller’s investigation into accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. In case the forfeited properties do not raise $10 million, the judge said, Manafort’s wife, Kathleen, has deposited $5 million in an account and his daughter Andrea Manafort Shand, $2 million in a separate account, to make up any difference. The assets cannot be touched without a court order. Once in Florida, Manafort must stay within the area, unless he is traveling to Washington for court appearances or meetings with counsel, according to the order. He needs permission for any other domestic travel and cannot leave the country. ",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017 ",1,1794
Pastor freed from prison in Iran to return to U.S. on Thursday: wife,"(Reuters) - A pastor from Idaho who was among five American prisoners released by Iran over the weekend will return to the United States on Thursday from Germany, his wife said on Wednesday. “Saeed will be landing on American soil Thursday evening,” Naghmeh Abedini said in a Facebook posting.  Saeed Abedini, 35, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was detained in 2012. He was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2013 after being accused of harming Iran’s national security by setting up home-based churches in his native country. “He will spend a few days with his parents and then the kids and I will join him on Monday,” his wife said. The couple have two young children. The Americans’ release coincided with the implementation of a nuclear deal under which international economic sanctions against Iran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s atomic program. The White House offered clemency to seven Iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the United States. Abedini, along with Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and former Marine Amir Hekmati, arrived at a U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, on Sunday. Also released by Iran were Iranian-American Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, who stayed behind, and American student Matthew Trevithick. ",politicsNews,"January 20, 2016 ",1,1336
"“ALLAHU AKBAR” MUSLIM EXTREMISTS Forced Catholic Priest At Knifepoint To Kneel While They Performed “Arabic Sermon”….Filmed Beheading Of Priest…Two Terrorists Shot DEAD…19 Yr Old Was KNOWN TERRORIST Allowed To Live With Parents, Roamed Freely During Day [VIDEO]","FRANCE HAS THE BLOOD OF THIS PRIEST ON THIER HANDS! Their political correctness allowed this KNOWN TERRORIST to roam freely in the streets! Shame on their progressive values that made it possible for this beautiful 84 year old priest, who was filling in at the church to be beheaded by these monsters!  The ISIS knifemen who stormed into a church in Normandy filmed themselves butchering an elderly priest after forcing him to kneel   before they performed a  sermon in Arabic  at the altar, a terrified witness has revealed today.The 84-year-old priest, named as Jacques Hamel, had his throat cut in a Normandy church this morning in an attack that also left a nun critically injured and both jihadis dead.The two killers, who were both known to French authorities, were shot dead by police marksmen as they emerged from the building shouting  Allahu Akbar . The building was later searched for bombs.One of the extremists who stormed into the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray near Rouen during mass was a French 19-year-old named Adel K., who was being monitored by electronic tag after twice attempting to join fanatics in Syria.

French authorities say they have arrested a third man over the attack   a 17-year-old man believed known as HB and believed to be a relative of Adel K.It was also revealed that the Catholic church involved was on a terrorist  hit list  found in the apartment of a suspected ISIS extremist last April.Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for a  merciless  response to the killing while  horrified  ex-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said he feared  everything is being done to trigger a war of religions .France s Socialist president Francois Hollande addresses the Islamic terror attack with the press here: A nun who was in the church during the attack said the priest was forced to the ground before his throat was slit.French authorities admitted that both of the attackers were subject to security  S  files, meaning both were known terror suspects who should have been under surveillance.Adel K. was a convicted terrorist who was meant to be living with his parents in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray with an electronic tag on his ankle.In March 2015, while still a minor, he tried to reach the terror group s base in Syria via Germany, but was arrested in Munich.  He was placed under judicial control with his parents, but after his 18th birthday again tried to return to the Middle East.Accompanied by two childhood friends, Adel K. headed to Switzerland overland and then took a plane to Turkey, hoping to cross the border into Syria.Turkish police deported him back to Switzerland and, after being sent back to his hometown, he was tried and found guilty of  associating with a terrorist enterprise  on May 22 2015.After spending less than a year of his two-and-a-half-year sentence in prison, he was released on March 22 this year.For entire story: Daily Mail ",politics,"Jul 26, 2016",0,3582
“BLACK SKIN PRIVILEGE” Why These Two Well Known Writers Say It’s A Real Thing [VIDEO],"If the title of this book was  White Skin Privilege  you would likely find it in just about every college campus library or school book store. Conversely, it s highly unlikely that you ll find the  Black Skin Privilege and the American Dream  book on any college or high school reading lists. After all, discrimination is a one-way street and as usual, the left gets to determine who s being discriminated against and who s guilty of discrimination In 2013, conservative writers David Horowitz and John Perazzo released a Kindle pamphlet titled,  Black Skin Privilege and the American Dream,  and today I want to give you an inside look courtesy Frontpage Magazine.In the pamphlet, the authors argued that, in their  obsessive quest to find evidence of illusory  white skin privilege,  the left instead winded up creating  black skin privilege. Its effects can be seen in the presumption of guilt on the part of innocent whites (think Duke lacrosse team) on the basis of their skin color, while guilty blacks (think O.J. Simpson) are often presumed innocent,  the authors wrote.Think also of Mike Brown and Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. The left turned Wilson into a bogeyman of alleged racial terror, while they portrayed Brown as an innocent  gentle giant.  Not surprisingly, the evidence eventually vindicated Wilson and proved without a doubt that the real villain had been Brown all along. Blacks can commit racist attacks on whites certain that civil rights  activists  who sift the news obsessively for black victims will either not notice or dismiss such attacks as a form of delayed  justice  for the historical oppression of black people,  the writers added.Indeed. I try to cover as much racial crime as possible, but frankly, too many stories of blacks assaulting whites appear on my feed for me to legitimately address them. If you want to know more about such crimes, I suggest you follow Colin Flaherty on YouTube:https://youtu.be/tMsJ1wc7mTwHere is an excerpt from the book: The result of such prejudice   there is no better word for it   is the creation of an optical illusion of deeply embedded, if largely invisible, white racism that creates vast numbers of black victims when the social facts show quite a different situation,  the authors added.According to FBI crime data released earlier this year, whites and Hispanics are far more likely to be killed by a black person than a black person is to be killed by either a white or Hispanic person.Alas, these sorts of facts  are suppressed (or shrugged off) by the media and civil rights  activists  dedicated to creating a one-sided and propagandistic narrative of race in the United States. As a result, we live in an age where every black criminal is automatically assumed to be a victim, while every white victim is automatically assumed to be a perpetrator.It s sad, but it s all part of Obama s America  Via: DownTrend",politics,"Jul 31, 2015",0,2982

 Florida Governor Rick Scott Tax Cut His Way Into Massive HIV/AIDS Comeback,"Rick Scott has been governor of Florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism. While the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of HIV and the number of people dying from AIDS drops, Florida is seeing the reverse.In a comprehensive review of how Scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding, the Miami Herald discovered two disturbing facts: Florida now leads the nation in HIV cases, and its biggest county, Miami-Dade, is ground zero.New cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. Miami-Dade and Broward together account for 38 percent of that total.Although Florida is among the nation s fastest-growing states, Scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the Department of Health.The 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions compared to 12,759 in the year Scott took office. It s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,  said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.  We have a rise in AIDS and we have a reduction in public health spending. We re now cutting just to be cutting. Indeed, Scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers. He s a tax-cutting superstar in the same vein as Kansas Governor Sam Brownback (who imploded his state s economy) and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (whose neglect poisoned an entire city).However, he differs from his fellow conservative tax-slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had. At least Brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth. In a disturbing reminder of the Reagan era, when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the AIDS epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy, Scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in HIV cases. Or perhaps he s just grown used to it. After his first year in office, the number of HIV cases has grown hand-over-fist.Making matters worse, Scott has routinely fought against working with Obamacare in his state. For years. All the while, HIV cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold. This spells disasters for the victims of HIV because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier AIDS illness is careful health management. You can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the President.As we ve seen around the country, Republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it. Far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self-determination, states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate.  It s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad,  but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it.Florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful.  Oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 24, 2016",0,3373
"Tillerson underlines cooperation with Japan, Seoul on North Korea","TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stressed on Thursday the importance of the United States working with allies Japan and South Korea to counter perceived threats from North Korea. “Trilateral cooperation is critical as we address the issue of North Korea,” Tillerson told Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo at the start of his first trip to Asia as President Donald Trump’s top diplomat. He visits South Korea and China later in the week. In addition to reassurances on dealing with Pyongyang’s repeated missile and nuclear tests, the former oil executive is also expected to press China to help restrain North Korea, while America’s allies will be looking to see how the new U.S. administration deals with Beijing’s growing economic and military clout.

BREAKING BOMBSHELL: UNDERCOVER VIDEO Shows NY Dem Elections Official Explain STUNNING Voter Fraud Scams In Minority Areas…No ID’s…Absentee Votes,"This video will leave you breathless, as you watch a NY Democrat out the Democrat party and the unbelievable voter fraud the commit. Mayor DeBlasio and Hillary should be sharing a cell together! The Manhattan Democratic representative on the city s Board of Elections was caught on a secret video slamming Mayor Bill de Blasio s municipal ID program as contributing to  all kinds of fraud    including at the polls. He gave out ID cards, de Blasio. That s in lieu of a driver s license, but you can use it for anything,  Commissioner Alan Schulkin said in the undercover video recorded by a muckraker for conservative nonprofit Project Veritas. But they didn t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say,  I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card,  he said in the bombshell tape. It s absurd. There is a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud . . . This is why I get more conservative as I get older. Schulkin didn t hold back to the undercover journalist, who identified herself as a political consultant at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party on Dec. 16.Not realizing he was being recorded, he broke with his own party s position that voter ID requirements hurt the poor and minorities.Schulkin said he backed the IDs to prevent rampant fraud. The law says you can t ask for anything. Which they really should be able to do,  Schulkin said, according to a copy of the video and transcript provided to The Post. I believe they should be able to do it,  he added.The videographer asked point-blank,  You think they should have voter ID in New York? Schulkin responded,  Voters? Yeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud. Conservatives claim ID checks help curb voter fraud.Liberal and civil rights groups argue such rules discourage voting and discriminate against minorities and the poor. You know, I don t think it s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an ID . . . You go into a building, you have to show them your ID,  Schulkin said.While discussing the potential for fraud, Schulkin volunteered that in some parts of the city,  they bus people around to vote . . . They put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site. Asked which neighborhoods, Schulkin said,  I don t want to say. When the undercover mentions black and Hispanic neighborhoods, Schulkin responded,  Yeah . . . and Chinese, too. At another point in the conversation, he discussed potential absentee ballot fraud. Oh, there s thousands of absentee ballots . . . I don t know where they came from,  he said.The undercover offered that  people can cover their faces  to shield their identity when voting, which triggered a conversation about burqas. The Muslims can do that, too. You don t know who they are,  Schulman said. Via: NYP",left-news,"Oct 11, 2016",0,2934
" Oregon Terrorist: Locals Want Us Gone, But We’re Staying Because U.S. Is A Republic (VIDEO)","The Bundy militia has now been making a nuisance of itself and terrorizing Harney County, Oregon with its armed occupation of Malheur Wildlife Refuge for two weeks now. It s been frustrating to sane people nationwide, but especially to the area s residents, whose lives have been disrupted by this nonsense. Unfortunately, though, it has been confirmed that these people have no intention of going anywhere. In fact, one of the militants, LaVoy Finicum, says they have a right to be there, even if the local residents want them to leave.Finicum said to the press that he knows that the people who actually live in the area want the militia to get out of dodge, and a third says we like what you re doing but not liking your method, appreciate it but we want you to go, and about a third saying don t go, stay.  However, the United States is a republic, so they aren t going anywhere. He went on to say: Let s talk about a republic. It s the right of an individual that we re looking at, not the right of the collective. You know if there is just one rancher that is saying please help me, please don t go, what about him? What about the Hammonds? What about that family that is in prison? Let them be released,  he said.  It is about the one family right now. Nevermind the fact that the Hammonds want absolutely nothing to do with this band of nutcases, and their attorney has said that these idiots do not speak for them.

 WATCH: Ivanka Trump Gets SKEWERED By Saturday Night Live For Helping Her Crazy Dad,"Ivanka Trump is complicit in what her father Donald Trump is doing to America and Saturday Night Live hilariously made sure everyone knows about it.In yet another classic commercial spoof, Saturday Night Live brilliantly mocked Ivanka, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson, with an advertisement for a perfume called  Complicit. As dressed in gold Ivanka walks across a ballroom where champagne is being served and guests are gawking at her as a narrator speaks highly about her without choking on the words. Every man knows her name. Every woman knows her face. When she walks into a room, all eyes are on her. She s Ivanka. And a woman like her deserves a fragrance all her own. A scent made just for her. Because she s beautiful, she s powerful, she s Complicit. She s a woman who knows what she wants,  the narrator continues.  And knows what she s doing. Complicit. Ivanka then walks up to a mirror and applies lipstick but her reflection is that of her father as played by Alec Baldwin. She doesn t crave the spotlight, but we see her. Oh, how we see her. The narrator then goes on to describe Ivanka using terms like  feminist  but has no idea why they apply to her. A feminist, an advocate, a champion for women,  the narrator says.  But, like, how? She s loyal. Devoted, but probably should ve bounced after that whole Access Hollywood bus thing,  the narration continued in reference to Donald Trump bragging about grabbing women s genitals without their consent.  Oh well,  Ivanka said.The commercial then concluded with an epic and accurate slogan for the  Complicit  perfume. For the woman who could stop all this   but won t. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Ivanka Trump has a lot of influence over her father but she has failed to use it. Instead, white nationalists like Steve Bannon are pulling the strings and America is suffering for it. Ivanka Trump should be ashamed of herself and she should always be remembered as the one person who could have done something but didn t.

WATCH OBAMA’S BROTHER Rip Barack And Endorse A Surprise Candidate In Rare Interview [Video]," Apparently, the U.S. leader has attitude issues.  President Barack Obama has been slated by his own brother   and revealed he will back Republican Donald Trump in the Presidential race. Speaking live from Kenya on British TV, Malik Obama also spoke about his relationship with Barack and claimed he has to make appointments to see him. And he told Good Morning Britain hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid that the US leader has issues with attitude. He said:  [Barack] has this attitude like  I m the president, I ve made it, I m the star here . I do understand that but I m just expressing my opinion and how I feel.  In a swipe at his sibling s incredible political career, Malik added:  Looking back, he made so many promises when he was running for president. He was riding on the promise of hope. There was so much excitement and we thought he would do so many things.  But look at the Middle East right now. It s a mess. People are being killed all over the place; Berlin, Florida, France, Brussels. And look at the situation in Iraq right now.  Malik also sounded pretty miffed when he revealed he has to request an appointment when he wants to see his brother.  I have to go through this woman and make a request, saying I would like to see him,  Malik added.  Then I just have to wait. The last time I requested to see him was June 15th and I ve only just got a response.  And that s how it usually works. It all depends on whether there s an opening in his diary.  The most shocking point Malik made during the interview was that he plans to vote for Barack s rival Donald Trump in the upcoming U.S. elections.Although the president is backing his friend Hilary Clinton for the job and has made no secret of his feelings towards Donald, Malik was more than happy to explain why he isn t supporting his brother.  Something is going on with Hilary that I don t like,  he explained.  Donald on the other hand, he speaks his mind and is straight forward.  And remember, the Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln   who freed slaves and freed the black man.  ",politics,"Jul 28, 2016",0,2166
BREAKING: CROOKED SEC OF STATE HILLARY Knew Taking $12 MILLION From King Mohammed VI of “Corrupt” Morocco Might Hurt Campaign…Took It Anyway [VIDEO],"Why is this woman not in jail?The evidence is overwhelming that Hillary was putting our national security at risk by taking money for the Clinton Foundation Slush Fund from foreign governments while Secretary of State, in return for favors. The latest Wikileaks email shows that our nations security was second to Hillary s desire to not get caught so it wouldn t hurt her chances at winning the election for the highest office in our nation. Here is the insane story of more Hillary corruption:Hillary Clinton solicited a $12 million donation from a government that her State Department considered corrupt, then realized the  mess  it would cause to her presidential run, a newly leaked  email reveals.King Mohammed VI of Morocco agreed to give the money to the Clinton Foundation, provided that it hold a convention in his country in May 2015 with Clinton as the keynote speaker.But Clinton realized that the conference, slated for a month after she announced her run for president, would hurt her candidacy. No matter what happens, she will be in Morocco hosting CGI [Clinton Global Initiative] on May 5-7, 2015. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,  top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to campaign manager Robby Mook in a November 2014 email revealed by Wiki Leaks.In another email, Abedin warned that if Clinton didn t attend, the $12 million would be off the table. Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,  Abedin wrote in a January 2015  email to Mook and campaign manager John  Podesta. CGI also wasn t pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn t their first choice. This was HRC s idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the [foundation s] endowment and to support the meeting,  Abedin continued. It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months. She created this mess and she knows it. The king gave the money to the Clinton Foundation and underwrote the CGI summit with the quid-pro-quo understanding that Hillary would attend, and other dignitaries attending were led to believe that she would be there.But Hillary sent Bill and Chelsea Clinton while she campaigned in Nevada and California.The deal with Morocco was struck even though the State Department   under Hillary Clinton   accused the country s government of  arbitrary arrests and corruption,  according to Fox News.It was unclear exactly how much went directly for the summit and how much went to the Clinton Foundation   but the total added up to $12 million, according to the emails.Guests at the May 2015 CGI summit   which was closed to the media   stayed at the five-star Selman-Marrakesh hotel, a posh lodging featuring a stable of Arabian horses and luxury amenities.The meeting was officially paid for by OCP, a Moroccan government-owned mining company that has been accused of human rights violations.Hillary Clinton supported the monarch when she was secretary of state, and the US-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure, the Daily Caller reported.Politico reported in 2015 that Clinton  was seen by [the Moroccan capital] Rabat as among its staunchest supporters in the Obama administration.

Iran sentences 'Mossad agent' to death over scientist killings,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has sentenced to death a person found guilty of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists, Tehran s prosecutor said on Tuesday. Dolatabadi did not identify the defendant, but Amnesty International said on Monday that Ahmadreza Djalali, an Iranian doctor who studied and taught in Sweden, had been sentenced to death in Iran on espionage charges. At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said was a program of assassinations aimed at sabotaging its nuclear energy program. Iran hanged one man in 2012 over the killings, saying he had links to Israel. On the latest conviction, Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi told the judiciary s news agency:  The person had several meetings with (Israeli intelligence agency) Mossad and provided them with sensitive information about Iran s military and nuclear sites in return for money and residency in Sweden.   The headline of the report described the convicted person as a  Mossad agent . Amnesty said the court verdict against Djalali stated that he had worked with the Israeli government which then helped him obtain a Swedish residency permit.  Neither Iran nor Amnesty said when the verdict was issued. Sweden condemned the sentence and said it had raised the matter with Iranian representatives in Stockholm and Tehran.  We condemn the use of the death penalty in all its forms. The death penalty is an inhuman, cruel and irreversible punishment that has no place in modern law,  Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said in an emailed comment. Djalali, a doctor and lecturer at Stockholm medical university the Karolinska Institute, was arrested in April 2016 and held without access to a lawyer for seven months, three of which were in solitary confinement, according to London-based Amnesty.   Djalali was sentenced to death after a grossly unfair trial that once again exposes not only the Iranian authorities  steadfast commitment to (the) use of the death penalty but their utter contempt for the rule of law,  said Philip Luther, Amnesty s Middle East advocacy director. The United States has denied Iran s accusation that it was involved in the scientists  deaths, while Israel has a policy of not commenting on such allegations. Dolatabadi said the convicted person gave Mossad information about 30 nuclear and military scientists including Massoud Ali Mohammadi, who was killed by a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside his home in Tehran. The judiciary said the defendant was also linked to the assassination of nuclear engineer Majid Shahriari, killed in a bomb attack in November 2010. Djalali s wife Vida Mehrannia, who lives in Sweden with their two children, has told Amnesty that his physical and mental health has sharply deteriorated since he was detained.   We are calling for his release because he has not committed any crime,  Amnesty quoted her as saying. The vice-chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, where Djalali received his PhD in disaster medicine in 2012, said he was deeply concerned.  For many years, he has worked with researchers from all over the world to improve the capacity of hospitals in countries suffering from extreme poverty or affected by disasters and armed conflicts,  Ole Petter Ottersen said in a statement published on the university s website.  We ask that Dr Djalali be subjected to due process and fair trial.  ",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",1,3512

"ARE ANGRY LEFTISTS Planning Violent Communist Revolution?…“It is their goal to “block, obstruct, disrupt” Trump’s Inauguration","Author Ed Klein told Pete Hegseth on Fox and Friends Weekend that Barack Obama is setting up a shadow government in Washington DC to undermine President Trump after Inauguration Day. Does Obama have plans to work with the underbelly of the Democrat Party to disrupt Trump s term as President?But could the left really attempt a violent revolution to overthrow the U.S. government and overturn the American way of life?Not only could they, but they will try, according to Douglas V. Gibbs, who has appeared as a commentator on Fox News and is a radio talk-show host in Los Angeles.And it won t be a liberal revolution. It will be a communist revolution.That s the prediction Gibbs made in an article published Friday in the Canada Free Press titled,  Democrats Prepare for Violent Revolution. Examining the evidence, he concludes a revolution attempt is not necessarily imminent, but that it will happen, once various pieces fall into place.Gibbs declared,  They are in full preparation for social and economic collapse, or a violent revolution. He cites the website DisruptJ20 and its  Call for a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017. Gibbs quotes Michael Moore explaining,  It is their goal to  block, obstruct, disrupt, and do whatever they can to prevent the onslaught that is going to happen with Donald Trump. .It is Gibbs  contention that,  The liberal leftists want desperately to sabotage the Trump administration, and possibly overthrow the entire government. For their socialist big government agenda, the ends justifies the means. Why now?Because, he explained,  [U]nder Obama, the veil was raised. Why worry about exposure now? They ve been poking the right-of-center groups in the chest for years, trying to instigate a violent response, and they never got it. Now,  he continued,  they may be realizing, it is up to them to initiate the violence. It is up to the leftists to finally launch the true coup. Or, at least that is what a lot of people think. Evidence that could support his theory is not hard to come by, as the left is becoming increasingly violent.During the 2016 presidential campaign, leftist riots broke out in cities across the country, the worst perhaps in San Jose, California, and in Chicago.WND reported assassination threats against Trump accompanied the nationwide rioting.Often-violent anti-Trump protests broke out in cities including Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Denver, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Seattle, Tampa, Dallas and Oakland, California.In Chicago, a video showed a mob of young black men beating and dragging through the streets a white man who voted for Trump.Portland, Oregon police termed a protest a riot after  anarchists  threw objects at officers, vandalized local businesses and damaged cars.Some 1,000 protesters in Oakland broke store windows, left graffiti on buildings and threw M-80 firecrackers, Molotov cocktails and bottles at police officers, authorities told CNN.And that s only the beginning, if Gibbs is right.He suggests the left will inevitably move on to more violence following the election of Trump, because  the realization that the Democrats are losing grip on their transformational agenda in the rest of the country has slammed the leftists square in the face. Gibbs asserts the leftists  hate any opposition, and are willing to do whatever it takes to either win over their opposition, or silence and eliminate their opposition. The next step by the left, according to Gibbs, is the stockpiling of arms. Now, it s the liberals who are suddenly worried, and stockpiling food, guns, and emergency supplies,  he observed.  Trump s 2016 win was a wake-up call. Their cheating, lying and violence was not enough to stop the man, and his very unorthodox approach to politics. Gibbs sees the left s hysteria as now having gone beyond insanity, marking a transition to violent anger.He believes the hysteria arose because the left they thought they had finally defeated the right permanently with the election of Obama, and that the election of Hillary Clinton would seal the deal. They only needed, now, to disarm the crazy right-wing bastards,  wrote Gibbs.  Then, with a faint whimper, the last of the opposition to the liberal left agenda would be gone. It seemed to them a near-certainty, but when it all came crashing down on Nov. 8, it was a disorienting  shock to the system.

Foreign tourist numbers up 23 percent in Tunisia in 2017,"TUNIS (Reuters) - The number of foreign tourists in Tunisia rose by 23 percent in 2017 compared with the previous year, official data showed, indicating that a vital industry crippled two years ago by Islamist attacks is recovering. Tourism accounts for about 8 percent of Tunisia s gross domestic product, provides thousands of jobs and is a key source of foreign currency, but has struggled since two deadly militant attacks in 2015. A total of 6.731 million tourists visited the North African country in the year until Dec. 20, data provided by the presidency showed. The number of European tourists rose by 19.5 percent to 1.664 million, the data showed. The number of French visitors rose by 45.5 percent and the number of Germans by 40.8 percent in the same period. The number of Algerians visiting rose by 40.5 percent to 2.322 million. Tunisia s tourism revenues rose by 16.3 percent to 2.69 billion dinars ($1.09 billion), data showed. In 2010 Tunisia s tourism revenues had hit a record at 3.5 billion dinars with almost 7 million tourists visiting. The rise is helping the government weather an economic crisis as it plans to raise taxes from 2018, part of reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund in return for a loan package. High unemployment has driven youth to seek illegal migration to Europe. ",worldnews,"December 27, 2017 ",1,1378
Trump says U.S. interest rates must change as Fed weighs rate hike,"YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has previously accused the Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates low to help President Barack Obama, said on Monday that the U.S. central bank has created a “false economy” and that interest rates should change. “They’re keeping the rates down so that everything else doesn’t go down,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s request to address a potential rate hike by the Federal Reserve in September. “We have a very false economy,” he said. “At some point the rates are going to have to change,” Trump, who was campaigning in Ohio on Monday, added. “The only thing that is strong is the artificial stock market,” he said. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month that the U.S. central bank was getting closer to raising interest rates, possibly as early as September, saying that the Fed sees the economy as close to meeting its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed raised interest rates last December for the first time in nearly a decade, and at that time projected four more hikes in 2016. The Fed later scaled back that projection to two rate hikes this year in the wake of a slowdown in global growth and continued financial market volatility. Trump, during the primary campaign, as he took on 16 Republican rivals, had called Yellen’s tenure “highly political” and said the Fed should raise interest rates but would not do so for “political reasons.” The Fed has been a target of some conservative critics in the U.S. Congress, who say the bank risked sparking inflation with its easy monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis. Fed officials say their independence is critical to making sound policy decisions. ",politicsNews,"September 5, 2016 ",1,1804

WOW! WOMAN TOTALLY FREAKS OUT At Sight Of Confederate Flag In Store…REAL OR FAKE OUTRAGE? [Video],"WHAT NOT TO DO IS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THIS NUTJOB DID:1. Do not angrily confront anyone with children in tow Franklin claims to be terrified of these men and yet she aggressively confronts them and films them while hurling insults at them. She thinks they are  racists  and people who support  hate symbols,  which leads one to believe she also thinks they are capable of great violence. Would you provoke violent racists while you have your children with you? I wouldn t. So either she s incredibly stupid or she knows these men aren t dangerous at all and what she is doing is meant to intimidate and shame them. (Let s also acknowledge that it can t possibly be good for children to hear their mother sobbing and freaking out while she does absolutely nothing to reassure them. It s hard to watch.)2. Don t lie about things that are verifiably untrue When faking a hate hoax, make sure you edit out the parts of the video that prove you re a liar. She lied about several things. First, she lied about the Confederate flags  hanging on the wall.  You ll notice that in the video you can t see any flags. That s because there weren t any on the wall like Franklin claimed. She might have gotten away with it if she hadn t taken a picture of the flags and posted them on her Facebook page for anyone to see. Here is the  flag  she claims was displayed on the wall: It it not a flag and it is not hanging on the wall. It s a rug that is hanging in a rug rack with other rugs and it s buried in the middle where she would have had to dig through them to find it. Then she lied about what the men said to her. We can clearly hear the man call her a  bit*h.  But when she describes what happens to her to a bystander, she decides to make it sound worse by saying he called her a  f***ing bit*h.  She also adds that they followed her around, which also doesn t appear true when watching the video she made.Then she lies about the man in the parking lot  approaching  her! Clearly, the man is filming her from about 50 feet away while standing absolutely still. He only moves once when she dares him not to come any closer and sarcastically takes one giant step forward like he s playing Simon Says. It s hilarious. This triggers the next mentally unstable reaction from the SJW.3. If you can t muster real tears, don t bother Her out-of-control response and fake crying are Razzie-worthy. She s so  terrified  and scared for her life that she remembers to turn the camera around so we can all see her dry cheeks as she wails uncontrollably at an ear-splitting frequency. Then, when a good Samaritan comes over to assist her, she continues her bad acting and fake sobbing while her nose grows on camera as she starts recounting a bunch of stuff that didn t happen, proving once again that SJWs always lie.Via: PJMedia",left-news,"May 15, 2017",0,2911
U.S. says holds Myanmar military leaders accountable in Rohingya crisis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday the United States held Myanmar’s military leadership responsible for its harsh crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim minority. Tillerson, however, stopped short of saying whether the United States would take any action against Myanmar’s military leaders over an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country. Washington has worked hard to establish close ties with Myanmar’s civilian-led government led by Nobel laureate and former dissident Aung San Suu Kyi in the face of competition from strategic rival China. “The world can’t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in the area,” Tillerson told Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. “We really hold the military leadership accountable for what’s happening,” said Tillerson, who said the United States was “extraordinarily concerned” by the situation. Forty-three U.S. lawmakers urged the Trump administration to reimpose U.S. travel bans on Myanmar’s military leaders and prepare targeted sanctions against those responsible for the crackdown. The request, in a letter to Tillerson from Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives, said Myanmar authorities “appear to be in denial of what has happened” and called for Washington to take “meaningful steps” against those who have committed human rights abuses. Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar in large numbers since late August when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape. Tillerson said Washington understood Myanmar had a militancy problem, but the military had to be disciplined and restrained in the way it dealt with this and to allow access to the region “so that we can get a full accounting of the circumstances.” “Someone, if these reports are true, is going to be held to account for that,” Tillerson said. “And it’s up to the military  leadership of Burma to decide, ‘What direction do they want to play in the future of Burma?’” Tillerson said Washington saw Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, as “an important emerging democracy,” but the Rohingya crisis was a test for the power-sharing government.  He said the United States would remain engaged, including ultimately at the United Nations “with the direction this takes.”   The European Union and the United States have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leadership. Punitive measures aimed specifically at top generals are among a range of options that have been discussed, but they are wary of action that could hurt the wider economy or destabilize already tense ties between Suu Kyi and the army. Tillerson also said he would visit New Delhi next week as the Trump administration sought to dramatically deepen cooperation with India in response to China’s challenges to “international law and norms” in Asia. Tillerson said the administration had began a “quiet conversation” with some emerging East Asian democracies about creating alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing.

"Repeal of individual mandate would increase uninsured, premiums: CBO","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than initially forecast. The CBO, the nonpartisan budget-scoring agency, said that eliminating the Obamacare mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine would lower the deficit by $338 billion over the next decade, not $416 billion as it estimated in December. The agency found that health insurance premiums would rise by about 10 percent in most years over the next decade in the individual market created by the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. It noted that markets in most areas of the country would remain stable. President Donald Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying. The U.S. House of Representatives unveiled its tax plan last week, and the Senate’s plan is expected to be released on Thursday. The individual mandate is a central tenet of Obamacare that health policy experts and proponents say is essential to making the law work. It compels young and healthy people to join health insurance markets and help lower premiums by offsetting the costs of sicker patients. Americans must note on their tax returns whether they have health coverage. Yet it has proved to be among the most controversial portions of the law as Republicans, who say Obamacare is too expensive and an example of government overreach, argue that the federal government should not be able to require people to buy health insurance if they do not want it. The CBO said in its December report that the individual mandate increases the federal deficit by encouraging people to buy subsidized coverage, either through Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, employer-provided plans, or through the Obamacare individual health insurance market.  Eliminating the mandate would lower the deficit by reducing federal spending on subsidized health insurance coverage, it said. The CBO said abolishing the requirement would cause premiums to rise because healthier people would be less likely to purchase insurance. It found that the resulting increases would cause more people to forego insurance. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2017 ",1,2641
Highlights: The Trump presidency on February 3 at 6:25 P.M. EST/2325 GMT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday: DODD-FRANK Trump orders reviews of major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, drawing fire from Democrats who said his order lacked substance and squarely aligned him with Wall Street bankers. Wealth managers from Wall Street to Wisconsin have spent the last six years lobbying against the retirement advice rule that Trump began killing off with a swipe of his pen. The United States ratchets up pressure on Iran, putting sanctions on 13 individuals and 12 entities days after the White House put Tehran “on notice” over a ballistic missile test. Instead of tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, the Trump administration is exploring how to tighten its enforcement and renegotiate key terms, but it may be impossible to get other major powers and Iran to consider revisions. A federal judge in Boston declines to extend a temporary restraining order that allowed some immigrants into the United States from certain countries despite being barred by Trump’s recent executive order. Tens of thousands of visas were revoked under Trump’s travel ban, the State Department says. U.S. immigration officials have postponed interviews with asylum seekers in an Australian camp since Trump’s executive order on immigration, suggesting Washington is already blocking progress on a controversial refugee resettlement deal. Chief executives of major U.S. companies met with Trump at the White House, with some expressing concern about the ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries traveling to the United States. Congressional Republicans repeal a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and vote to ax emissions limits on drilling operations, part of a push to remove Obama-era regulations on extractive industries. Trump’s agenda to repeal Obamacare and punish “sanctuary cities” for resisting him on immigration is making its presence felt in the $3.8 trillion municipal bond market. European Union leaders agree to stick together in dealing with Trump, but at their first summit since he took office they are at odds on how far to confront or engage with him. The Trump administration is in the midst “of a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba” with a focus on its human rights policies. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2017 ",1,2430

"In edgy Kenyan slum, a rumor ends in fires and a death","NAIROBI (Reuters) - It all started with a rumor: the Mungiki, a dreaded Kikuyu tribal militia, had infiltrated Nairobi s Kawangware slum. Within minutes, local men already fired up by Kenya s divisive election had grabbed machetes and sticks to defend their turf. By the end of Friday night s confrontation, a man had been beaten to death and rows of shops and homes set alight, a worrying taste of how quickly ethnic violence can erupt in the Kenyan capital s volatile slums. Almost all the 50 deaths since August s presidential vote have been in clashes between protesters and police. The deeper fear of Kenyans is that the months of political strife, exacerbated by the courts annulling the August vote, eat away at deep tribal divisions and ignite a wave of inter-ethnic violence, as happened after a disputed 2007 vote when 1,200 people were killed. The Kawangware fighting was sparked by rumors that Kikuyu, the tribe of President Uhuru Kenyatta, had drafted in members of the Mungiki to protect them from opposition supporters.  On Friday, a Reuters witness saw a group of men armed with machetes, known locally as pangas, on the streets of Kawangware. Their identity was unclear, although several residents said they were Mungiki, brought in after opposition loyalists burnt down a prominent Kikuyu-owned business the previous night. The Mungiki, notorious for castrating and decapitating victims, were blamed for hundreds of deaths in the 2007 clashes. Their relative quiet since has not diminished their reputation.  They were more than a hundred, and they were carrying all new pangas,  Vitalis Aloyi, a Kawangware resident, said. Another man said residents had to act to defend themselves.  We had to teach them not to bring Mungiki here. If they bring Mungiki, we will destroy their property and their lives,  said Kennedy Ochieng, an ethnic Luo, like opposition leader Raila Odinga. As the pro-Odinga vigilantes, also armed with clubs and machetes, swept down the muddy street they set fire to Kikuyu businesses suspected of hiding Mungiki militiamen, Ochieng said. One man was killed, and his body burned, leaving a charred spot on the road. Some Odinga supporters denounced him as Mungiki, but no one could explain how they knew. The next day, with smoke still rising from the twisted wreckage of homes and shops, the remaining traders in Kawangware began loading their wares of pipes, popcorn machines and meat onto trucks.  All the other tribes are against the Kikuyu here because of the voting,  said Stephen Kamau, whose fruit stall was burned down.  These people will come back and burn more.  Others in the district, long home to mixed communities, said the truth was more nuanced. As political tensions rose, some businesses had hired local youths for protection, said Rhoda Kungu, a market trader. She insisted the vigilantes were not Mungiki.  We are all brothers and sisters. We just want to live in peace,  she said.  Another trader, Brian Njenga, said it may merely have been pro-Odinga youths spotting a chance to enrich themselves, demanding protection money or looting businesses before they burned them.  Some people are just using this situation to get personal benefit,  Njenga said to somber nods from a crowd of youths around him.  Many have not worked for a long time because the economy is very down.  A few hundred meters down the rubbish-strewn road, hundreds of young men milled around on street corners. Teargas from the night before lingered in the air.  We want to kill Mungiki. They must know this is our territory,  one man shouted.  Don t think because it is quiet now that we are at peace. We are just waiting for something!  ",worldnews,"October 28, 2017 ",1,3728

WOW! Why George W. Bush Never Left DC Until After Christmas Day,"Meanwhile, the Obama s jet off to Hawaii every year well before Christmas. When you read the reason why the Bush s wait in DC until after Christmas day, you ll see why its really all about putting others before yourself Like many Americans, U.S. presidents often take time off around the holidays.However, according to journalist Joseph Curl, who previously covered the White House, former President George W. Bush went on Christmas vacation in a way that stands in direct contrast to President Barack Obama. [H]ere s the thing: In December, we never left Washington, D.C., until the day after Christmas. Never. Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, would always depart the White House a few days before the holiday and hunker down at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland,  Curl wrote in a 2013 column that was republished Thursday.After a few years, curiosity finally got to the former Washington Times reporter and he asked a low-level administration official why. I still remember what she said,  Curl wrote.  So all of us can be with our families on Christmas. Who was  us ? Hundreds and hundreds of people, that s who. Sure, the reporters who covered the president, but also dozens and dozens on his staff, 100 Secret Service agents, maybe more, and all of those city cops required whenever the president s on the move in D.C.,  Curl added in his column.However, things seemingly changed when Obama took office. [T]his president would never delay his trip to his island getaway. He s off every year well before Christmas. Hundreds and hundreds head off with him, leaving family behind,  Curl wrote.

 WATCH: John Oliver Rips ‘Douchebag’ Trump For Attacking Obama And Calling Election ‘Rigged,"John Oliver had a field day mocking Donald Trump on Sunday night for repeatedly shooting himself in the foot and it was an absolute laugh riot.The HBO host of Last Week Tonight began by talking about how Hillary Clinton released her tax returns and has had to answer questions about Clinton Foundation connections to the State Department, which could have helped the Republican nominee if he hadn t utterly screwed himself and his own campaign by running his mouth. She was eclipsed by the imploding star that is Donald Trump, the owner of what you might describe as a  resting rich face,  Oliver said.You see, Trump tried to briefly act sane by reading his speech material off of a teleprompter, which the right-wing hypocritically whines about President Obama doing, so he can t go off script and say stupid things. This was the 53rd consecutive week he was going to put his campaign back on track,  Oliver quipped.But no sooner had Trump started doing that when he started calling for  Second Amendment people  to do something about Hillary, claimed the the election is rigged, and declared that President Obama literally  founded ISIS. Wow,  Oliver remarked.  Now clearly what he just said is absolutely absurd, but even when people try to help him reframe it, he doubled down. Indeed, during an interview with right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt he doubled down on his accusation despite being given an opportunity to walk his statements back, only to then claim that he was merely being  sarcastic  when he repeatedly called the sitting President of the United States the leader of a terrorist organization. He s so insistent!  Oliver continued.  He s like the guy drowning but waving off a lifeboat saying,  Get out of here, I m very buoyant. I m the most buoyant. Everybody talks about my buoyancy. I m a tremendous floater.  And yes,  sarcasm  is a bullshit excuse. It s the douchebag s apology. After incredulously noting that Trump walked back his  bullshit excuse,  Oliver then took on Trump s dangerous charge that Hillary will only win the election because it is  rigged. What is really worth taking note of there, and is worth thinking about, is that he s suggesting the election may be stolen by his opponent, and that s actually dangerous. He is priming his supporters to question the result when he loses Pennsylvania, as polls indicate he will, and as all Republican presidential candidates have since 1988. In fact, Trump actually urged police officers who support him to patrol polling places to make sure voters don t vote multiple times. In short, Trump supporters are primed to intimidate minority voters on Election Day, because as we all know, conservatives believe minority voters cheat the system. But Oliver pointed out how Americans will know if Trump somehow wins the election. In a way, we are all Trump Election Day observers. Because if you look out of your window in November and see the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse you ll know, oh shit, they just called Florida! Oliver then explained that his team signed up as an  election observer  on Trump s website to see what would happen and they got an email declaring that  we are going to do everything we are legally allowed to do to stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election.  And that prompted Oliver to question if Trump knows what is legal and what is not since his own lawyer once claimed that spousal rape isn t real. Plus, again, Trump suggested that gun nuts assassinate Hillary Clinton.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald Trump is a con man who is trying to become the most powerful person on the face of the planet. He is so good at lying to his supporters that he has even told them to their faces that he is lying to them and they were too dumb to notice.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 15, 2016",0,3874
 One Hero Made Donald Trump Panic And Made Twitter Celebrate (DETAILS),"If you were bored on Thursday night at around 7pm ET and felt the need to peruse President Trump s Twitter feed, you might ve instead encountered a blue page bearing the message,  Sorry, that page doesn t exist! , eventually just replaced with an even more generic-looking response:Yes, for a whole 11 minutes Donald Trump s Twitter account was down.Twitter is sometimes seen as that one avenue where voyeurs and sociopaths can coexist so it comes as no surprise that the medium is a favorite of President Trump s, as well as his supporters and critics alike. It is where we get to see the truly uncensored leader, not following a script, just posting exactly what comes to mind and digging his hole deeper with every tweet. A normal day for Trump generally begins by taking to Twitter to attack Democrats, North Korea and, of course, kneeling NFL players before he starts his presidential duties.However, some have grown tired of Trump s early morning poop-tweets and one person decided to take action. That s right, this wasn t the result of some glitch of sorts, but was actually an inside job. To be more specific, it was the work of a heroic Twitter employee on their last day on the job. Twitter initially released a statement saying the President s feed was inadvertently deactivated due to a human error,  but it didn t take long for the truth to come out.Earlier today @realdonaldtrump s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.  Twitter Government (@TwitterGov) November 3, 2017Through our investigation we have learned that this was done by a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee s last day. We are conducting a full internal review. https://t.co/mlarOgiaRF  Twitter Government (@TwitterGov) November 3, 2017Naturally, the Twittersphere initially went into conspiracy mode when they couldn t access Trump s account, with the common assumption being that the President had finally been booted from the platform. Many have requested that President Trump be banned from Twitter under the belief that his tweets about North Korea could be bringing the United States closer to the brink of nuclear war, something Twitter has declined to do, claiming they must weigh the newsworthiness of Trump s tweets with its violent rhetoric.Instead, on this occasion, it was just a Twitter employee having the intestinal fortitude to do what many have probably fantasized about doing on their last day of work.Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 3, 2017",0,2726

Morneau Shepell​ sees no impact from pension legislation,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Morneau Shepell Inc (MSI.TO), the human resources management company at the heart of conflict-of-interest allegations against Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said on Friday it would not benefit from pension or tax legislation proposed by the Liberal government. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s government has been badly shaken by the conflict-of-interest controversy about his finance minister, who is the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of Morneau Shepell. Some have questioned whether Morneau, whose father founded Morneau Shepell, would be forced to resign. Morneau Shepell, a major provider of pension administration services to private companies and government agencies, said it is not involved in the consultation for either changes to the small business tax code or to the pension reform.  If passed, (the pension reform) would allow federally regulated pension plans the option to implement target benefit pension plans. They would not be required to do this,  the company said in a statement.  Several provinces have already enacted similar enabling legislation for pension plans that they regulate, but in practice, very few employers have adopted it,  Morneau Shepell said. The company said it severed all contact with Morneau upon his election to the House of Commons in October 2015. Morneau resigned as executive chairman of Morneau Shepell shortly after his election. Morneau, who was named finance minister shortly after his election to Parliament, said last week he would put his assets in a blind trust and divest his stockholding in the family business in response to criticism that his proposals for pension or tax reform could benefit his company and his personal finances. On Thursday, Morneau said he will donate to charity any profit that his Morneau Shepell shares have made since he was elected. The company s stock, currently trading at C$21.17, closed at C$15.77 in the session before the election, which would put the potential profit for the 1 million shares Morneau has said he holds at C$5.4 million. Morneau told reporters on Thursday he did not know what the difference in the value of the shares will be. Opposition parties from both the political left and right have seized on the ethics scandal, trying to tie Trudeau s team to what they say is an entitled Liberal Party that has previously faced corruption charges.

NFL’S PHONY PATRIOTISM: US Defense Department Paid NFL DISGUSTING $4.5 Million For On-Field Flag Appearances…Welcome Home Tributes,"Every day, the NFL gives fans another reason to stop supporting them. Although the NFL agreed to refund a small portion of the money our Defense Department (US taxpayers) have paid them to show support for our military, it s the idea that Americans have been duped into believing it was something they did out of honor or reverence for our military. The NFL has reached a new low with their acceptance of players who are disrespecting our flag to promote Obama s race war while disallowing the Dallas Cowboys to honor the 5 police officers slain in their hometown by a Black Lives Matter terrorist. Don t forget, they also looked away when Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell posted an Instagram picture of a cop with his neck being slit open. The NFL never said a word. They never even acknowledged what some considered to be a terrorist type threat to our law enforcement.In May 2016, the NFL announced that they would return more than $700,000 of taxpayers  money that was paid to teams for sponsored military tributes.After being criticized for  paid patriotism,  in which money came out of the armed forces budget for various measures of public recognition during games, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league would pay that money back.In a letter written to Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain on Wednesday, and disclosed on Thursday, Goodell said that   following an audited review of 100 marketing agreements from 2012 to 2015 by accounting firm Deloitte & Touche   teams were deemed to have received $723,734 for acts of sponsored patriotism. Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer,  the report said.  Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks.   PGLast year, Flake and McCain disclosed that the U.S. Department of Defense had spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams from 2011 to 2014. Some of those contracts disclosed that payment was for on-field flag ceremonies and tributes to welcome home veterans. One team, the Atlanta Falcons, had made more than $1 million from the department over those four seasons.The National Guard spent $6.7 million on contracts with NFL teams from 2013 to 2015.

"PROOF That Obama Interfered TWICE In Foreign Elections, Including Time He Used U.S. TAXPAYER MONEY To Defeat Conservative Israeli Leader [VIDEO]","President Barack Obama recently said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin to  knock it off  back in September. Obama s alleged demand was a result of the supposed  hacking  of the computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), in what has been presented as an attempt by the Russians to influence the outcome of the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.This alleged effort by the Russians was even cited as a reason to block Trump s election in the Electoral College. Some presidential electors even asked for an intelligence briefing before they cast their votes, so they would know exactly what Putin s government did. Of course, almost all those asking for the briefing were Democrat electors already voting for Trump s Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, so it could be dismissed as just a political ploy.But, if the Russians did covertly attempt to alter the outcome of the presidential election, it would seem somewhat hypocritical of the U.S. government to take umbrage. After all, the United States, under several presidents both Democrat and Republican, has repeatedly interfered in foreign elections, both covertly and overtly, multiple times in the past several decades.Most recently, President Obama told British voters that they better not vote for Brexit   the public vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (EU)   or they would find themselves  at the back of the queue [line]  in getting any sort of trade deal with the United States. Of course, with Obama leaving office on January 20, he would not be making any trade deals with anyone much longer anyway.Here is the video of Barack Obama attempting to influence the Brexit vote by threatening to put them at the back of the que:Obama went on to say,  I think this [membership in the EU] makes you guys bigger players,  at a joint press conference with then-British Prime Minister David Cameron, a staunch supporter of remaining in the EU. In the end, the British did not take Obama s  advice,  and opted to leave the EU.It was not the first time that the Obama administration attempted to determine the outcome of a foreign election. In the last Israeli election, the Obama State Department funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to the opposition of Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that the State Department and a group called One Voice coordinated political activities   including the building of a voter database, the training of activists, and the hiring of a political consulting firm tied to President Obama himself.Watch here:Yet, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has charged that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election by releasing e-mails damaging to the Clinton campaign effort. But why is it acceptable for the United States government to interfere in another nation s election campaign efforts, but not acceptable for other countries   including Russia   to (allegedly) interfere in U.S. elections?The Brexit vote and Israeli election are not the only times this has happened. Don Levin of Carnegie Mellon University has documented 81 times the United States has attempted to influence presidential elections in other countries between 1946 and 2000. And then, of course, there are the military coups backed by the United States and the regime changes imposed by military actions. In his study, Levin described  intervention  as including funding of the election campaigns of selected political parties, the dissemination of political propaganda, training of local activists in political techniques, and public comments by high-ranking U.S. officials, favoring or disfavoring one side or the other. He also included public threats to withdraw foreign aid, or even promises to provide it if one side were to be elected.For entire story: The American",politics,"Jun 8, 2017",0,4026
" BUSTED: Trump Supporter Tries To Rig Election For The GOP, Gets ARRESTED","Donald Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of rigging the election against him, but it turns out his own supporters are doing everything they can to rig it in his favor.And that includes voting twice, something Republicans continually claim that Democratic voters always get away with doing.The Des Moines Register reports,Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into the Polk County Jail about 3:40 p.m. Thursday on a first-degree election misconduct charge, which is a Class D felony.Rote, a registered Republican, reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the Polk County Election Office, 120 Second Ave., and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in Des Moines, according to a Des Moines police report.So just to recap, Rote literally committed voter fraud in a desperate attempt to get Trump and the Republican Party an extra vote in this election.That s the precise definition of election rigging, but you won t hear Trump say anything about this because he thinks that Democrats are the ones committing voter fraud, which is why he has called for his supporters to intimidate minority voters at polling places.But this incident is far from the only time during this election that a Republican has been caught trying to rig the election.A Wisconsin city clerk was recently busted for trying to deny an extra polling place near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she argued in an email that students lean Democratic. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,  Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. Imagine if a Democratic clerk denied letting a church be a polling place on the premise that most religious people are Republicans. The outrage and whining would last for days.And a right-wing group is literally creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on Election Day. Keep in mind that Republicans often accuse Democratic voters of using fake IDs to vote multiple times, but here s a right-wing group making fake IDs so they can use voter suppression tactics to swing the vote in favor of Trump.Thus far, it appears that only Donald Trump s supporters are trying to rig the election, not Democrats as he so often claims. And just think, there are still ten days left until Election Day. Still plenty of time for even more hypocritical Trump supporters to be caught trying to rig the election for the small-handed man who whines about how unfair our democratic system is.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2016",0,3144
U.S. lawmaker wounded in June shooting discharged from hospital,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Congressman Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican leader in the House of Representatives who was shot and wounded last month, has been discharged from a hospital, the medical center said on Wednesday. The Louisiana lawmaker has made “excellent progress” in his recovery and is beginning a period of intensive rehabilitation after being released from MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Tuesday, MedStar said in a statement. “He is in good spirits and is looking forward to his return to work once he completes rehabilitation,” the statement said. It did not say how long Scalise was expected to be in rehabilitation before returning to work. Scalise was among Republican lawmakers attacked June 14 in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, by a gunman who  opened fire on them while they were practicing for a charity baseball game against Democrats. Scalise, 51, was shot in the hip. He underwent surgery this month to treat an infection related to his wound. The gunman, James Hodgkinson, 66, had a history of posting angry messages against Republican President Donald Trump. He died after being wounded during a shootout with police at the ballpark.

" Trump Has Sent Out His First Email Begging For Money, And It’s Beyond Ludicrous","Ever the self-absorbed, narcissistic candidate, Donald Trump has nevertheless been reduced to doing what every other candidate in any race does   sending out fundraising emails asking for donations. His first email, though, doesn t feel like a sincere attempt at raising money. Instead, it s full of the same language he uses to talk about how great he is, with a little twist thrown in to remind everyone of how rich he is, too.Our three-ring political circus began his very first fundraising email with this: I m going to help make it the most successful introductory fundraising email in modern political history by personally matching every dollar that comes in WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS At most, that will raise $4 million, and only if everything goes exactly as planned, including the number of people he believes will donate the needed dollars. Considering that Ben Carson s failure of a campaign has more cash on hand than he does, this fundraising effort already isn t off to the best of starts. It doesn t seem to matter to him, though, as long as he comes off sounding like the winner we all know he s not: Even without this match, this initial effort would have been the most successful first fundraising email in history. I am certain of this. Oh, please. What a prognosticator he is! He then gets into his typical insulting rant, attacking Hillary Clinton and alluding to this delusion he s got that, once he s president, America will win so much that we ll all be sick of it: The bottom line   Crooked Hillary has been a DISASTER for our country, and we must win against her this fall.Let s make history again, and keep winning, by making this the most successful first fundraising email ever. And if it s not, he ll get up on a stage somewhere, stand behind a podium, and claim he raised ten times the amount of money he actually raised just so he can look successful. For May, his campaign only raised $3 million, compared to the $26 million that Hillary raised. Hillary also has $40 million more in cash than Trump does. Yet he told NBC News,  I understand money better than anybody. Sure he does. So he ll raise $4 million if he s very lucky and claim he raised $40 million. Or at least, that he outraised Hillary even if it s not true. As Slate writer Elliot Hannon said,  It will be interesting to see if the email moves the needle.

" Republicans Turn On Trump, Throw Him Under The Bus For F*cking Up Health Care Plan (DETAILS)","When Republicans celebrated Donald Trump s undeserved election victory, they probably never imagined he d damage the party as badly as he already has in just nine weeks.This week, Trump once again embarrassed the GOP by messing up their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. Not only did Trump fail to sell the disastrous American Health Care Act, but he pulled the bill on Friday. Understandably, Republicans are pissed that Trump conducted things this way, and are distancing themselves from him more than ever. In fact, they re blaming him and saying that he and the White House had been an obstacle from the start, setting them up for failure. One House Republican (who wanted to remain anonymous) said: Their heart was not in the healthcare battle. Think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban, or on the wiretapping claims. He certainly checked the boxes on healthcare, to his credit. But it s self-evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this. Trump and his minions have countered this claim, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer issuing a statement on Saturday: The president and vice president left everything on the field  They were making calls and having members to the White House all week. In total, we spoke or met with over 120 members of Congress. And yet, this doesn t seem to add up, considering that Trump s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were nowhere to be found as sh*t was hitting the fan on Friday. Kushner, who is one of Trump s key advisors, was actually skiing with Ivanka in Aspen as House Republicans tried to pass their horrible health care bill and failed. And it s not just Kushner they re pissed at   it s Trump himself.According to House staffers and other GOPers, Trump didn t seem focused when in meetings concerning the Obamacare repeal. Another unnamed Republican said: Halfway through that meeting, he stopped to talk about Gorsuch. His mind was bouncing around. I never felt they were dialed into this. Maybe next time the GOP will think twice about letting a five-year-old become their party s nominee. What we re witnessing here is the breakdown of the Republican Party, and it s so humiliating that we almost feel bad for them. Almost.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 25, 2017",0,2375
Finnish court bans neo-Nazi group,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - A Finnish court banned neo-Nazi group the Nordic Resistance Movement (PVL) on Thursday, saying there was an  urgent social need  to shut down the group which it said spread hate speech and incited violence.

Trump Treasury nominee wants to loosen limits under Volcker rule: document,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dialing back the Volcker Rule that limits banks’ ability to engage in speculative investments is a top priority for President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, according to a document seen by Reuters on Monday. In written responses to questions posed by members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Mnuchin said he would use his role as head of the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council to give the Volcker Rule a stricter definition of proprietary trading.  In “prop trading” a financial firm uses its own money to invest in privately held companies, hedge funds and similar vehicles. The Volcker rule was designed to limit the type of risk-taking activities that helped land banks in trouble during the financial crisis. “As Chair of FSOC I would plan to address the issue of the definition of the Volcker Rule to make sure that banks can provide the necessary liquidity for customer markets and address the issues in the Fed report,” Mnuchin wrote in the document, which also included senators’ questions and was verified by a Senate aide. During his confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee last week, Mnuchin cited a recent Federal Reserve report that found the rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law, was limiting market liquidity. The committee has not yet scheduled a date to vote to send the nomination to the full chamber for approval. Regulators have applied proprietary trading prohibitions to too many activities, he said. The Fed report found that ambiguity and gray areas in the rule were pushing dealers to conservative strategies to ensure they did not cross the line on the prohibitions. In the responses Mnuchin also made it clear he believes the  rule should only apply to “a bank that benefits from federal deposit insurance.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees retail deposits at about 6,000 banks, including the consumer banking arms of the country’s largest investment banks. The law currently applies to banks that have access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window or other government backstop.  Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat who serves on the Finance Committee, wrote that uninsured investment banks also pose risks that the rule, named for former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker, was supposed to address. “As we saw during the financial crisis, when nonbanking affiliates of FDIC insured banks failed, they were rescued by their insured affiliates, which in turn were forced to be rescued by taxpayers,” she wrote. “This was the case with State Street Bank, and your former employer, Goldman Sachs, which converted to a bank holding company in order to be eligible for federal bailout funds.” Mnuchin reiterated that an updated version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that had long separated commercial and investment banking should be instated to reduce risks. The law was repealed in 1999. Mnuchin has not shared details of his “21st Century Glass-Steagall,” but hinted it would be looser than the original. “A bright line between commercial and investment banking, although less complicated, may inhibit the necessary lending and capital markets activities to support a robust economy,” he wrote.

U.S. judge orders Illinois to boost disabled care,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday ruled that Illinois was not providing sufficient resources for the care of developmentally disabled residents and ordered the state to come up with a plan to restore services. U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman said Illinois, which just ended an unprecedented budget impasse, failed to provide “resources of sufficient quality, scope, and variety” to the residents, who as a result “suffered substantially” from a reduction in services in violation of a federal consent decree. In the ruling, Johnson said she lacked the authority to order a funding increase, noted the state’s “dire financial condition,” and directed Illinois to devise a plan to address issues affecting the services and comply with the decree. The state had argued that advocates for the disabled living outside of institutions were seeking as much as an additional $1 billion annually - an amount Illinois could not afford. A two-year budget impasse that ballooned the state’s unpaid bill backlog to more than $15 billion ended in July when lawmakers enacted a fiscal 2018 budget over the governor’s vetoes. That budget allocates $53.4 million for the first rate increase for developmentally disabled services since 2008. But the advocates said the funding boost was insufficient to retain workers and services. “What (the state) comes up with will be the next step,” said Barry Taylor, vice president at Equip for Equality, one of the advocates, in a phone call. The judge set a status hearing for Oct. 27. Meghan Powers, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Human Services, said in an email that the state was committed to providing quality services to the developmentally disabled.  “The state will continue to meet all its legal obligations and will review the court’s rulings to determine appropriate next steps,” she said. Another U.S. judge ordered Illinois in June to substantially boost its monthly payments to Medicaid providers to ensure continued health care for poor and disabled residents covered under a separate federal consent decree. The state had owed those providers more than $3 billion. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2017 ",1,2188
RECKLESS: CLINTON PRESIDENCY Could Mean U.S. Muslim Population Would Exceed Germany’s 4.8 Million [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton always putting a radical ideology and her own personal financial gain before the best interests of America. Is this really the kind of leader America needs after 8 miserable, lawless years of Barack Obama? Under two terms of a President Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Muslim population would exceed Germany s current Muslim population, according to data from Pew Research Center and the Department of Homeland Security.According to a Pew report published earlier this week,  as of 2010, there were 4.8 million Muslims in Germany. In September, 2015, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that the United States should accept 65,000 refugees from Syria to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis created by the war there. We re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more,  the former secretary of state said Sunday on CBS   Face the Nation.   I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.  Via: CBS NewsHere s Trump on the out-of-control refugee crisis and common sense ideas on how he thinks America should deal with it:A Pew report from January of this year estimated that there are roughly 3.3 million Muslims living in the United States. This means that today the U.S. already has a larger Muslim population than does Kuwait, or Brunei, or Bahrain, or Djibouti, or Qatar. Under current policy, Pew projects the number of Muslims in America will outnumber Jews by 2040. However, under a President Hillary Clinton it s possible that date could come much sooner.Under two terms of a Hillary Clinton presidency, the U.S. would have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany s Muslim population of 4.8 million.Based on the most recent DHS data available, the U.S. permanently resettled roughly 149,000 migrants from predominantly Muslim countries on green cards in 2014.Yet, as Donald Trump explained during Thursday night acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Clinton  has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. Specifically, Clinton had said that, as president, she would expand Muslim migration by importing an additional 65,000 Syrian refugees into the United States during the course of a single fiscal year. Clinton has made no indication that she would limit her proposed Syrian refugee program to one year.As Trump explained, Clinton s Syrian refugees would come on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U.S. already admits from Muslim countries.Adding Clinton s 65,000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149,000 Muslim migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year, means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214,000 Muslim migrants in her first year as President. If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her Presidency, she could potentially resettle roughly 1.5 million Muslim migrants during her first two terms.These projections suggest that after seven years of a Hillary Clinton Presidency, the U.S. could have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany s Muslim population of 4.8 million.These projections are rough estimates, and the population size could be impacted by additional various factors  including births, deaths, and conversions.

Iceland PM calls snap election after coalition party quits over 'breach of trust',"REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Iceland s prime minister called for a snap parliamentary election on Friday after one party in the ruling coalition quit the government formed less than nine months ago. The outgoing party, Bright Future, cited a  breach of trust  after Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s party allegedly tried to cover up a scandal involving his father.  That leaves the country, whose economy was wrecked by the collapse of its banking system nearly a decade ago, facing its second snap election in less than a year. The outgoing government would be the shortest-living in Iceland s history. The previous government was felled by the Panama Papers scandal over offshore tax havens.   We have lost the majority and I don t see anything that indicates we can regain that. I am calling an election,  Benediktsson told reporters. He said he would be looking to hold the election in November though that would mean it would not be possible to finish next year s budget. It is ultimately up to President Gudni Johannesson, whom Benediktsson will meet with on Saturday, to make the decision on a new election.  If he accepts the call for an election he is likely to ask the government to stay in place until a new coalition is formed but he could also ask other parties to try form a majority. Johannesson was not immediately available for comment. The news knocked more than 1 percent off the value of the Icelandic crown against the euro and the dollar. The scandal revolves around a letter written by Benediktsson s father to help an old friend have his criminal record expunged after he was convicted of sex offences against children.    The board of Bright Future has decided to terminate cooperation with the government of Bjarni Benediktsson,  the party said in a statement.  The reason for the split is a serious breach of trust within the government.   The Ministry of Justice, under Sigridur Andersen, a member of Benediktsson s Independence Party, initially refused to disclose who had written the letter of recommendation. She was later ordered to do so by a parliamentary committee. Andersen told broadcaster Stod 2 that she had informed Benediktsson about his father s involvement in July but had not told anyone else.       I was told by the justice minister that we were discussing confidential matters, which followed the rules of the ministry...I decided to handle the issue as a confidential matter,  Benediktsson said. He had later informed the chairmen of the coalition parties, he said.  First, it was illegal for me to indulge the information, second, I informed them when I could.  The prime minister s father, Benedikt Sveinsson, confirmed on Friday that he had signed a letter supporting his friend s application to have his  honor restored , a procedure that effectively erases a criminal record. Among the requirements is a letter of recommendation from a close friend or associate.        Sveinsson said he had not discussed the letter with anyone.  This week, it came forth that my father had written a letter... I couldn t have written such a letter myself and I will never try to defend that,  Bendiktsson told a news  conference. Capital Economics economist Stephen Brown said a change of government could frustrate plans to overhaul Iceland s monetary policy framework. Benediktsson s administration has asked experts to look at options, including pegging the crown to the euro or the pound to keep sharp shifts in the currency from  destabilising the economy. The central bank cut interest rates four times in the year to June to tame the crown. The currency has soared on the back of a tourism boom that has helped the economy recover from years of crisis but increased the risks of overheating. The strong currency is also hurting Iceland s exports.       I think if there s going to be another election and possibly the chance of a more left-wing government, then that probably decreases the chance of monetary policy being loosened any further in the future,  Brown said.   That could be quite important.  ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1,4128
Pugnacious New Yorkers hit back at presidential candidate Cruz,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ted Cruz - be careful who you mess with. Never shy in defense of their city, New Yorkers came out swinging - via social and traditional media - on Friday after the Texas Republican’s comments about “New York values” during a  presidential debate. Cruz’s remarks, aimed as a put-down of campaign rival Donald Trump during Thursday evening’s sour-toned Republican debate, sparked a backlash from city and upstate dwellers, politicians and ordinary citizens alike. James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, a New York police officer who was killed on 9/11, wrote in a Facebook post: “I invite you to come to the National 9-11 Memorial and Museum and see for yourself, and perhaps learn something about, the values of New Yorkers and the Heroes who defended American values on September 11th, 2001.” One theme emerged in particular as New Yorkers piled in: the idea that the senator may be less fastidious when it comes to financing his campaign to be his party’s nominee for the November presidential election.  “I’m sure Ted Cruz was very negative about New York money,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told NY1 anchor Pat Kiernan, calling on Cruz to apologize to all New Yorkers. “I’m sure he’s not going to accept any money from any New Yorker. I’m sure if he has, he’s going to return all of those contributions,” said Cuomo, a Democrat. Cruz, top challenger to front-runner Trump in the Republican race, has lately been denouncing “New York values” to try to connect the real estate mogul to the city’s liberalism and to reinforce his own standing as a conservative.  During Thursday evening’s debate, Cruz said on the values issue, “And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.”  Trump responded with an emotional tribute to the resilience his home city showed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. According to Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) data, that exchange between Cruz and Trump was the second-most tweeted moment during the debate. Among tweets shared on Friday was the cover of the New York Daily News, which curtly told Cruz: “Drop Dead, Ted.” Michael Bruno (@MikeJBruno) tweeted on Friday: “@tedcruz you, sir, wouldn’t last 2 minutes in New York. We don’t take kindly to people like you. And that’s our #NewYorkValues.” Nicholas Dyer (@NicholasDDyer), who identifies himself as a Comedy Central producer on Twitter, said: “@tedcruz is the kind of guy who takes his family to the Times Square Applebee’s for dinner. #NewYorkValues.” He was referring scathingly to a chain restaurant that is normally filled with tourists from out of town. “My #NewYorkValues: Tolerance, eccentricity, sleaze, pizza, bagels, dancing, not making eye contact,” tweeted Lindsay Goldwert (@lindsaygoldwert). Many on Twitter perceived Cruz as having targeted the city’s Jewish and gay communities.  Zack Ford (@ZackFord), the LGBT editor at the progressive blog Think Progress, tweeted, “So...#NewYorkValues...Do you just pick a state you know you probably won’t win and belittle everyone from it?” He added, “Cruz knows Trump’s not Jewish, right?” Cameron Gray (@Cameron_Gray) said, “As a Jewish conservative born in Brooklyn, I proudly have #NewYorkValues.  Some local businesses piggybacked the theme to advertise. Drama Book Shop, a theater book store in midtown Manhattan, tweeted: “The #DramaBookShop is proud to have had #NewYorkValues for 99 years.” Others sought to distinguish the politics of the city, which is liberal and overwhelmingly votes Democratic in presidential elections, from the rest of the state. Josephine (@notmyname02) said on Twitter, “Unshackle Upstate New York. We have nothing to do with New York City values. We have mid-West values. #NewYorkValues.” To be sure, some thought the backlash against Cruz was not warranted. Wesley23 (@50th_President) tweeted: “I still think people are overreacting to #TedCruz and his #NewYorkValues line. He clearly meant it was a blue (Democratic) state (and) not very conservative.”  It appeared that neither Cruz nor Trump may have benefited from the exchange. Overall, conversations about the Republican candidates during the debate were negative on social media, according to analytics firm Zoomph.

 White Students Accused Of Dragging Black Classmate By A Rope Around Her Neck (VIDEO),"The parents of a 6th grade student at Live Oak Classical School, located in Waco, Texas, are outraged over school officials  failure to take action against a group of alleged white student bullies.The 12-year-old victim, who is referred to in media reports as KP, says that a group of three white boys have repeatedly injured and accosted her at the school, where she is one of only a handful of Black students.According to Vibe the boys have approached KP in the hallway, shoving her and kicking her. Her parents sent an email to the school in November, asking officials to address the situation.School officials responded by saying that they spoke with the boys and had determined that the kicking incident was meant as  a joke. In April, students of the school were taken on a field trip to a nearby ranch. According to the girl, she was standing next to a rope swing when the same group of white boys grabbed the rope, wrapped it around her neck and then threw her violently to the ground.Images of the girl s neck show rope burns that are consistent with her story.This time school officials claim that KP s injuries were the result of an  accident,  not intentional racist bullying.If that s not enough, they are now insinuating that the 12-year-old and her family are trying to milk the school for money.After school officials refused to address the behavior of the student bullies, KP s parents contacted an attorney. The attorney then contacted the school. School officials provided the media with a copy of an email stating that the family would be willing to settle for $2.7 million.After repeated attempts to get the school to deal with the students responsible for their daughter s injuries, the girl s parents decided to hit them where it hurts. Good for them.As Vibe reports here, KP s parents decided to send their daughter to the expensive private school in Waco, Texas, so she could receive  a better education,  in what they assumed would be a  wholesome learning environment.  According to its website, the school claims to have a  Christian worldview. Live Oak Classical School has a student body that is 87 percent white and just two percent Black. It s located in Waco, Texas, an area of the country that has a long and ugly history of racism.The willingness of school officials to downplay and dismiss allegations of racist bullying speaks for itself. A Black student had a rope wrapped around her throat.

 Deputy Attorney General PISSED; Trump Ordered Him To Find Reason To Fire Comey,"Just when you think you re starting to figure out what happened with James Comey getting fired from the FBI, another tidbit of information comes out and turns the whole thing on its head once again.In a new twist, Donald Trump knew that Comey reported directly to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. So, in an effort to move things along with Comey, he had them come to the White House.According to The Washington Post: The president already had decided to fire Comey, according to this person. But in the meeting, several White House officials said Trump gave Sessions and Rosenstein a directive: to explain in writing the case against Comey. And we all know what happened next. The memos were written by all parties and made public pretty fast. Faster than Comey could even become aware he was fired.Here s the thing, though. Deputy AG Rosenstein is pissed he s basically become the fall guy for Trump.WaPo reports: Rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey and that the president acted only on his recommendation, said the person close to the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. You see, the narrative came out that Comey went to the Justice Department only days before he was fired requesting  more prosecutors and other personnel to accelerate the bureau s investigation into Russia s interference in the presidential election.  And this request was made to Rosenstein,  whose memo was used to justify Mr. Comey s abrupt dismissal on Tuesday. Now that Rosenstein is pissed, it s looking more and more likely that Trump may have planned it this way and made Rosenstein the fall guy for Comey s removal.The plot in this story of mayhem is definitely getting thicker and it will be interesting to see how things progress in the coming weeks and months.Featured Photo by Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2017",0,2079
 BREAKING: Highest-Ranking Elected Republican Says He Won’t Support Trump,"The GOP implosion we have been waiting for has finally come full circle. Now that John Kasich and Ted Cruz have bowed out of the GOP race for the 2016 presidential nomination, Trump pretty much has it in the bag. There s just one problem though: not all avowed Republicans are supporting him. In fact, there s an active #NeverTrump movement, and even a #RepublicansForHillary movement. In other words, sane conservatives are willing to do all they can to stop Trump. Now, we can add another name to the list of prominent republicans to the list of those who cannot find it within themselves to back Trump: House Speaker and GOP Convention Chair Paul Ryan.The New York Times reports that Speaker Ryan insists that the GOP establishment needs a  standard bearer  and Trump is not that. Ryan goes on to say, I don t want to underplay what he accomplished.  That being said, though, Ryan believes that the GOP needs a nominee who  appeals to a vast majority of Americans.  He also said: We hope that our nominee aspires to Lincoln and Reaganesque. I think conservatives want to know does he share our values and our principles. There s a lot of questions conservatives are going to want answers to. Well, Mr. Ryan, sane people, be they liberals, conservatives, or somewhere in between, definitely want nothing to do with the bigotry that Trump is spewing. He is not a man we need anywhere near any position of power. however, you and your GOP compatriots have spent eons playing to the bigotry of the Stupid People of America, and this is your result. You created this monster. Now, you handle it. Get rid of Trump at all costs, unless you want your party to die a slow and painful death sometime between now and November. You are already more than well on your way.Trump is dangerous. Your job is to put country before party, not the other way around. Perhaps your speaking sense today, Speaker Ryan, will rub off on your fellow republican politicians. We can hope and dream, right?Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"May 5, 2016",0,2091

We ll see!The lie that REALLY stood out is that she said she heard of the Bill/Loretta meeting  in the news . Do you think for one minute that she didn t hear this from Bill first?

A scandal no one thought I would have the guts to address head on. It appears he s going to address his sexual harassment issues, but instead he reveals his true talking point: The shocking allegations of the abuse of power that have been leveled against the Obama administration. He then attempts to introduce Fox News reporter Laurie Dhue (one of the actual women who received a settlement after filing a sexual harassment suit). After he s told that she no longer works for Fox News, O Reilly asks,  Well, did she receive the check? After speaking to another female reporter who, for obvious reasons, had to stay 500 yards away from him, he goes on to address the issues he s having with sponsors leaving the show. As you know, 60 of our sponsors have pulled ads from the program,  O Reilly said, before going to commercial break.  No word as to why yet. We thank the following for sticking with us. After that, fake ads played for dog cocaine and horse Cialis. Now this is hard for me to discuss, but I also have been in the news this week,  Baldwin s O Reilly said after the break.  Several women have come forward and accused me of offering them exciting opportunities here at Fox News. Beyond that, the details are fuzzy, but one man was brave enough to come to my defense. A man who is unimpeachable on all female issues. Cue Donald Trump who did, in real life, come to O Reilly s defense this past week. The two then appear together in split screen.

 White House Defends Boehner’s ‘Lucifer’ Comment About Cruz: ‘He Was Just Looking To Be Honest’ (VIDEO),"Ever since former House Speaker John Boehner aired out his true feelings about Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, everyone has been having a field day and running with it.It all started on Wednesday, when John Boehner was asked about the 2016 election during a forum at Stanford University. It just so happened that Cruz s name came up in the discussion, and Boehner couldn t hold back his disgust for his fellow conservative. Referring to Cruz as  Lucifer in the flesh,  Boehner mocked the Texas senator: I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life. This is a thought that many Republicans would actually agree with, as it s been well-documented that Cruz is one of the least-liked politicians   with several of those opinions coming from within the GOP. This fact only gets proven time and time again.On Thursday, the White House hilariously failed to come to Cruz s defense during a daily briefing, clearly amused by the Republicans  in-party fighting. The room broke out in giggles when CNN s Michelle Kosinski asked Press Secretary John Earnest if he felt Obama would agree with Boehner s  Lucifer  comment, and whether those remarks were appropriate or not.Earnest, trying to hold back laughter, suggested that Boehner was just trying to be as truthful as possible. Earnest was barely able to keep a straight face as he replied: Obviously, Speaker Boehner was speaking based on his own experience. I don t know that he was looking to be helpful or harmful, I think he was just looking to be honest about his own view. Weighing in on whether Boehner s comments had crossed a line, Earnest simply said that if Kosinski was looking for somebody to come to the defense of one Republican who s being attacked by another, you should probably ask somebody else.

Kurds offer joint border deployment as Iraq threatens more military operations,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq s Kurdish region said on Thursday it had offered a joint Kurdish-Iraqi deployment at a strategic crossing into Turkey with the participation of U.S.-led international forces as part of a compromise aimed at ending a stand-off with Baghdad. The offer was disclosed hours after the Iraqi armed forces threatened to resume military operations against the Kurds, accusing them of delaying the handover of control of borders and taking advantage of negotiations to bolster their defenses. The central government in Baghdad has cracked down hard on the Kurds since the government of the Kurdish autonomous region staged an independence referendum on Sept. 25 that Baghdad considers illegal. Central government forces swiftly seized swathes of Kurdish-held territory last month and have demanded control of all border checkpoints, including the Turkish frontier which has been controlled by the Kurds since the Saddam Hussein era. Over the past week, the Kurds have tried to defuse the crisis with negotiations. The Kurdish defense department said the offer for joint control of the frontier was part of a  deconfliction  proposal made to Baghdad on Oct. 31. Other proposals included a ceasefire on all fronts, continued cooperation in the fight against Islamic State and joint deployments in so-called disputed territories claimed by both the Kurds and the Iraqi central government. The KRG  continues to welcome a permanent ceasefire on all fronts, deconfliction and the start of a political dialogue  with Baghdad, the Kurdish statement said. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended military operations against the Kurds on Friday. The sides have since held talks which Baghdad says cover only technical issues, with political questions off the table unless the Kurds discard the referendum. Iran and Turkey back Abadi s tough line, fearing a drive for independence could spread to their own Kurdish populations.  The Kurdish statement said the offer of a joint deployment at the strategic Fish-Khabur crossing was meant  as a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution . Fish-Khabur is strategically vital for the landlocked Kurds as the point where oil from northern Iraq crosses into Turkey. Iraq wants the Kurdistan region to stop exporting its own oil and hand over sales to the Iraqi state-oil marketer SOMO, the company s director said on Thursday. Iraq is talking to Turkey to let SOMO sell Kurdish crude that arrives by pipeline, acting SOMO director general Alaa al-Yasiri told reporters. The Iraqi Joint Operations Command accused the Kurds on Wednesday of using the talks  buy time  to strengthen positions.  We will not allow it; the federal forces are mandated to secure (the disputed) areas and borders,  it said in a statement. The command of the Kurdish security forces, known as Peshmerga, accused Iraqi troops of massing weapons and threatening force to resolve  domestic political differences . The office of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq said more than 183,000 civilians had been displaced by the conflict, including 79,000 from Kirkuk city which Baghdad captured on the first day of its offensive last month.  A humanitarian official involved in the relief efforts said more than three quarters of the displaced are Kurds. Iraqi troops set up positions on Tuesday at the Turkish border for the first time, between Turkish and Kurdish checkpoints at Habur, the Turkish name for the road border crossing located 10 km from Fish-Khabur in Iraq. The Turkish frontier with Iraqi Kurdistan is a critical security issue for Turkey, which says Kurdish insurgents fighting against the Turkish state shelter across it. Turkish security forces killed 17 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants near the border, the Turkish armed forces said on Thursday, after eight members of Turkey s security forces were killed in clashes. The Kurdish militants were intercepted crossing the border into Turkey, the Turkish military said. ",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1,4181
Death of Australian Hughes ruled 'tragic accident',"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes was a ‘tragic accident’ and not as a result of a failure to enforce the rules of the game or inadequate safety equipment, the New South Wales (NSW) Coroner’s Court ruled on Friday. Hughes was hit on the back of the neck by a rising delivery when playing for South Australia in a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Nov. 25, 2014. He died two days later in a Sydney hospital. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine whether the 25-year-old’s death could have been avoided, NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes said he could find no evidence to support the view of Hughes’ family that he had died in a “very unsafe workplace”. “The family’s grief at losing their much loved son and brother was exacerbated by their belief that unfair play had contributed to his death,” said Barnes. “It is hoped that they accept the compelling evidence that the rules were complied with. Phillip was excelling at the crease as he so often did and that his death was a tragic accident.” The helmet worn by Hughes came under the spotlight following his death, though the NSW Coroner said the batsman’s death could not have been avoided by wearing different protective equipment.  Australia’s cricket board in May made it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Hughes. The family had been angered that Hughes had been subjected to threatening language from an opponent and had suffered a sustained spell of aggressive short-pitched bowling that contravened the rules of the game.     Barnes accepted Hughes had received a barrage of short-pitch blowing, but all of which fell within the rules of the game. The court said it was unable to rule on whether Hughes had been subjected to threatening language, though Barnes said it was implausible that no “sledging” had occurred at all during the day. “Hopefully, the focus on this unsavoury aspect of the incident may cause those who claim to love the game to reflect upon whether the practice of sledging is worthy of its participants,” said Barnes.  “An outsider is left to wonder why such a beautiful game would need such an ugly underside.” ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1,2329
Paul Ryan sees common ground with Trump budget plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Republican leaders on Tuesday praised President Donald Trump’s proposed federal spending budget and said lawmakers would be able to find common ground with the administration’s plan. “At least we now have common objectives: grow the economy, balance the budget.

 WATCH: Don Lemon SCHOOLS Trump Supporter For Calling Trump’s Win A ‘Landslide’,"Apparently, conservatives do not know what a dictionary is, much less how to read one.In the reality created by conservatives in their narrow minds, facts are lies, lies are facts, and words have different definitions.Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum on Twitter over CNN s coverage of him and actually had the gall to call his election win a  landslide. .@CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don t know what to do.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016During a panel discussion on CNN on Monday, a Trump supporter repeatedly claimed that Donald Trump won the election  by a landslide  even though he got nowhere near the electoral vote totals of President Obama and lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes to Hillary Clinton.Paris Dennard s ridiculous claim forced CNN host Don Lemon to humiliate him on the air. It s also false for Trump to say that the electoral college vote was a landslide. It was certainly an upset, but it was far from a landslide. You go back to 1980, he had a smaller margin than the Reagan elections, George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama s two elections   he tops only George W. Bush s two narrow wins. Can he call this a landslide? Why is he calling this a landslide? It s not a landslide, he got way more than most people thought, but you can t really call this a landslide. Dennard responded by repeatedly changing the definition of the word  landslide  to mean simply beating Hillary Clinton. But Lemon would have none of it. You re changing the definition of landslide?  Lemon replied.  You can say he did better because he won, but can you call something a landslide when it s not actually a landslide? Is that what you re doing? It wasn t a landslide, Paris. A landslide is only a landslide when it s the definition of a landslide. That s not the definition of a landslide. That s you changing the definition of a landslide. Dennard s ignorance forced Bakari Sellers to burst out in laughter while Kayleigh McEnany could only close her eyes in embarrassment.Here s the video via YouTube.As Lemon pointed out, Donald Trump definitely did NOT win by a landslide. In fact, he may not have even won at all if recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania flip the vote in favor of Hillary Clinton.Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 29, 2016",0,2441
STUNNING DEVELOPMENT: OBAMA GIVES $75 MILLION US Tax Dollars To Mexico To Build Border Wall,"You have got to be kidding me! After all the times that Trump has been attacked by the Democratic side of our society for saying that we need a wall on our Mexican border to stop illegals from getting into our country and destroying our economy, Obama just pulled the most hypocritical and pointless move of his career.Obama just gave a  gift  of $75 MILLION to Mexico to provide material and equipment for the building of a border wall on Mexico s SOUTHERN border and to help cover the expense of training to help man the wall properly.So basically he is helping Mexico to keep out illegals from central America because Mexico doesn t want them. Yet the Mexican President, Enrique Pe a Nieto, says he will not pay for the border wall on the northern border of Mexico to keep them out of the U.S, and Obama somehow sees the logic in this?Trump has and always will be right about the wall blocking Mexico and if Obama had wanted to help a country keep illegals out then maybe he should start in the country that he is President in. Then again Obama has given trillions of dollars away to other countries while we Americans still sit here struggling to pay simple bill like mortgages, medical, food, electricity, etc.I guess he felt the need to stick it to us in a special kind of way before we unceremoniously drop him outside of the White House gates come January 2017.H/T [ Young Cons , Conservative Tribune ]",politics,"Sep 17, 2016",0,1501
 Four Top Law Firms REFUSE To Represent Deadbeat Trump In Russia Probe,"Donald Trump may want to hire the best and the brightest to represent him in his growing Russia scandal, but that s certainly not what he is going to get. Apparently, had as big a problem in finding competent legal representation as he is in filling the government with worthwhile people.Yahoo News reports that the White House sought help from Brendan Sullivan of Williams & Connolly, Ted Olson of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Paul Clement and Mark Filip of Kirkland & Ellis, and Robert Giuffra of Sullivan & Cromwell, in dealing with the Russia investigation.All of them told him to f*ck the f*ck off.While he ultimately settled   key word being  settled    on his chief lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, he was turned down by some of the biggest names in the legal profession because Trump wouldn t listen to their advice, and even if he did listen he would continue his long tradition of not paying people he hires:The lawyers and their firms cited a variety of factors in choosing not to take on the president as a client. Some, like Brendan Sullivan, said they had upcoming trials or existing commitments that would make it impossible for them to devote the necessary time and resources to Trump s defense.Others mentioned potential conflicts with clients of their firms, such as financial institutions that have already received subpoenas relating to potential money-laundering issues that are part of the investigation.But a consistent theme, the sources said, was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position. The concerns were,  The guy won t pay and he won t listen,  said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration, as well as deliberations within the firms themselves.In addition, there are fears that association with The Donald would  kill recruitment  because of the shame involved in serving Trump willingly. Do I want to be associated with this president and his policies?  the lawyer said.Trump has representation, but it really says something that the top legal minds in the nation consider him and the Russia scandal a lost cause.Featured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee",News,"June 6, 2017",0,2356
"Republican Congress takes on Washington, D.C., laws to local outrage","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A vote by U.S. House Republicans on Monday to strike down a Washington, D.C., law that would allow doctor-assisted suicide has put the conservative Congress on a collision course with the liberal city that hosts it, local officials said. In the District of Columbia, where just 4 percent of the population voted for President Donald Trump, city leaders worry that Republicans will overturn progressive laws on issues like gun control and abortion, to the outrage of locals who have long complained of curtailed rights. One of the most liberal U.S. cities, Washington is unique in that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the option to block its legislative moves. Its 680,000 residents pay federal income taxes but have no voting representative in Congress. “This is yet another attempt by this House committee to trample the autonomy of the D.C. Government and undermine our local control,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who signed the assisted suicide law in December, said in a statement after the signing. Monday’s vote by the House Oversight Committee, headed by Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz, took the first step in overturning the measure letting doctors help terminally ill patients end their lives. The full House and Senate would now have to vote and Trump would have to sign a repeal by Friday, the 30-day deadline for Congress to act. “Congressman Jason Chaffetz has sent a signal to D.C. residents that Congress has zero respect or concern for their will or the will of their elected officials,” Bowser said.  Bowser called the vote a power grab by legislators who espouse states’ right to make their own laws but differ when the heavily Democratic city is involved. The vote was the first in a series of Republican-sponsored measures taking on city laws. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida last month introduced legislation that would bar city lawmakers from passing gun control laws and repeal local firearm registration requirements. Rubio said the measure, aimed at Washington, was needed to protect residents’ constitutional right to bear arms. The House also has approved a bill that would permanently ban the District from using local tax funds for abortions for poor women. Congress granted the 68-square-mile (117-square-km) enclave a mayor and council in the 1970s and has voided only a handful of District laws since then. But Chaffetz has pledged to intensify scrutiny, saying at Monday’s hearing that the assisted suicide law could create “a marketplace for death.” Washington’s city council has passed laws in recent years on issues dear to liberal Democrats nationally. These include a $15-an-hour minimum wage, legalized recreational marijuana and one of the country’s most generous family leave laws. “The District is a progressive jurisdiction in the midst of a conservative Congress,” Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District’s congressional representative, said in a phone interview. Washington leaders have relied on the Senate, which has long had less appetite than the House to interfere with District laws. The city also had an ally in Democratic President Barack Obama. That protection is gone, Norton said. ",politicsNews,"February 14, 2017 ",1,3250
Coalition of 13 states to challenge Trump on vehicle emission standards,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York State’s attorney general and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said on Friday they would mount a vigorous court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules by the Trump administration.  In March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough on the auto industry. The push to weaken the rules by the Trump administration comes as automakers are worried that consumers shift to larger vehicles and low gas prices will make it expensive or impossible to meet the regulations. They also fear a prolonged fight with states over the rules could make revising their product plans difficult. Democratic state officials have been increasingly aggressive in challenging Trump administration regulatory rollback efforts. “In light of the critical public health and environmental benefits the standards will deliver, if EPA acts to weaken or delay the current standards for model years 2022-25, like California, we intend to vigorously pursue appropriate legal remedies to block such action,” the state attorneys wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency including Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, Washington State, Oregon and Rhode Island. An EPA spokesman said Friday the agency is reviewing the letter. Automakers including General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp say the Obama administration did not conduct a proper review to ensure those rules are feasible. Automakers have met with Trump administration officials in recent months and hope to reach a deal with California and other states on vehicle fuel efficiency standards. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said automakers “urge everyone to avoid pre-judging the results” of the ongoing review. “A process is now under way again for a thoughtful and coordinated analysis,” California has opposed weakening the rules, threatened to pursue tougher standards unilaterally and could mount a legal challenge.     The White House plans to hold negotiations with car companies, California and potentially other states. A deal would remove uncertainty for automakers, who need years of lead time to engineer future models and want uniform rules across all 50 states. The Obama administration’s rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Under the 2011 deal, the 2022-2025 model year rules had to be finalized by April 2018. The Obama administration completed a review of the 2022-2025 rules days before leaving office. Without a deal, automakers could be forced to meet one set of standards in California and a dozen states that have adopted its rules and other rules in the rest of the country. In 2011, Obama said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

 San Jose Cop Wrongly Held Black Family At Gunpoint In Front Of Their 7-Year Old Child,"The San Jose Police Department has been plagued with accusations of racism and racial profiling, and now they re getting sued for it. A black family alleges that an officer followed them home from picking up their seven-year old daughter, and held them at gunpoint for absolutely no reason other than they were black, and the father, Emmanuel Stephens, might have matched the description of a  suspicious black man  in the area. The family is suing for an unspecified amount in damages.The first question that many people will ask themselves when faced with a like this is, what did this family do that caused the officer to draw his gun?According the lawsuit, they did nothing, and it s that kind of question that perpetuates racism in the justice system, because nobody asks themselves that when the victim is white. Officer Alexander Keller followed them home, and then when they got out of their car, he got out of his and drew his gun. The officer also put Stephens in handcuffs and held him in the back of his patrol car for a while. Their car was searched, and Stephens was cited for possession of a small amount of pot, despite having it for medical reasons and producing a prescription to prove it.Worse, when their 14-year old daughter came out, she was threatened with a trip to Juvenile Hall if she went back to get her cell phone and record the whole sordid incident.Their lawyer said: What happened to my clients happens all the time and is a real problem.This type of police misconduct only gets attention when someone ends up dead, but this type of non-lethal harassment is much more widespread and also need to be brought to light and stopped. The department, however, says that there isn t any bias in their policing methods despite strong evidence to the contrary, and this situation would seem to be another piece of that evidence. Another cop later said that someone had reported a suspicious black man with a purple backpack in that area, but Stephens had no such backpack. Keller proceeded to profile him anyway.Even if Stephens did have such a backpack, there was no way for this officer to see that from his car when he decided to follow them, hold them at gunpoint, detain Stephens, and search their car without a warrant and without probable cause. Being black does not constitute probable cause.San Jose s police department is like many others, though. Black people are guilty until proven innocent, and are treated as such. Had this been a white family, and someone had reported a suspicious white man in their area, would Keller still have followed them home and drawn his gun on them? Searched their car without a warrant or evidence of wrongdoing? Cited him for medical marijuana for which he had a prescription?Very likely not.Featured image by David Paul Morris/Getty Images",News,"August 3, 2016",0,2894

" Ted Cruz Says Endorsing Trump Is A ‘Grave Mistake’, Promises To Do It Anyway (VIDEO)","Republican presidential candidate and Texas Senator Ted Cruz believes with every ounce of his being that Donald Trump in the White House is a  grave mistake  but he confessed that he would endorse the disgraceful GOP candidate anyway.Cruz revealed this on Sunday during CNN s State of the Union. Host Jack Tapper asked Cruz about the recent attacks against Trump by other conservatives, especially presidential candidate Marco Rubio (R-FL). Not to be outdone, Cruz also had some choice words for Trump, blasting the front runner for standing behind Planned Parenthood, his plan to stay neutral between Israel and the Palestinians,  and  longtime support of expanding Obamacare into Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care, putting government bureaucrats into a position to ration your care, especially that of seniors. Cruz, absolutely terrified of what President Trump could mean for America, warned: If Donald becomes president, who the heck knows what he would do? Even Donald doesn t know what he would do. I think the challenges facing the nation, they re too grave to roll the dice. Cruz made it perfectly clear during this interview that he felt a Trump presidency would be the worst case scenario for America, but Tapper pressed him to see if he would still back his rival if Trump took the nomination. Cruz s answer is puzzling   after all the negative things he just said about Trump, Cruz still felt that: I will support the Republican nominee. Period. The end. This response by Cruz is absolutely infuriating and goes beyond stupidity. Cruz recognizes that Trump is dishonest, terribly offensive, unqualified and without question the wrong person to lead the country and will STILL advocate for him just because he s a Republican. Cruz should be wise enough to know that even though he doesn t want a Democrat president in the White House, America would be in far more capable hands and so much safer.You can watch the interview below:In another part of this interview, Tapper also asked the same question of candidate John Kasich (R-OH). Kasich echoed Cruz s opinion and said: At the end of the day, I m going to support that person who came through the arena and became the nominee. As insane as these responses from Cruz and Kasich are, they re not entirely to blame   the Republican National Committee is basically forcing them to back Trump if he wins the nomination, as every GOP candidate took a solemn oath to support whichever candidate wins the Republican party s nomination.It s so unfortunate that the GOP is so bitter about left-leaning politics that they would rather support a candidate that is going to destroy America than explore alternative possibilities with a more capable Democratic candidate. They cannot see far enough past their narrow-minded views and hateful rhetoric to see that the future of America will be greatly jeopardized with Trump, and they d rather watch it crash and burn than trust someone outside the GOP.

Trump signs memo directing Pentagon to implement transgender ban,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that directs the U.S. military not to accept transgender men and women as recruits and halts the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgeries for active personnel unless the process is already underway. The memo, released by the White House, laid out in more detail a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. armed forces that Trump announced via Twitter last month, reversing a policy shift started under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. In it, Trump directed the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to stop using government funds for sex-reassignment procedures unless it is necessary “to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex,” the memo said. The order requires Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to determine in the coming months how to handle transgender individuals currently serving in the military using criteria including “military effectiveness and lethality,” budget constraints and law. A White House official who briefed reporters about the memo declined to specify whether transgender service men and women who are currently active in the military could continue to serve based on such criteria. The official said Trump decided the Obama administration had not identified a sufficient basis for changing what was then long-standing policy on transgender troops. The memo called on Mattis to submit a plan to Trump by February 21, 2018, on how to implement the changes. Trump’s decision appealed to some in his conservative political base while creating uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the Pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly. The change drew swift criticism from advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. “The President’s order to remove transgender service members from the United States armed forces and deny them healthcare is nothing less than a purge,” Matt Thorn, executive director of OutServe-SLDN, a group dedicated to LGBT equality in the military, said in a statement. “Our military is strongest when all people who are fit to serve have the opportunity to do so. This unprecedented policy amounts to a purge of qualified, contributing troops, and will serve only to undermine unit cohesion and weaken military readiness,” said Jennifer Levi, an official at the gay rights group GLAD (GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders) in a statement. Asked how the policy squared with Trump’s pledge to stand up for gay rights, the White House official said the president would ensure that such rights were protected but had been critical previously of the transgender changes under the Obama administration.

U.S. 'diversity visa' program in spotlight after New York attack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A visa program aimed at diversifying the U.S. immigrant population came under attack from President Donald Trump on Wednesday after he learned that the man accused of killing eight people in New York City on Tuesday used it to enter the country.        Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged in Tuesday’s truck attack, immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010 after winning a lottery enabling him to obtain a so-called “diversity visa,” two government officials confirmed to Reuters.  The program, established by Congress and coordinated by the State Department, has its roots in efforts to bring more Irish and Italian immigrants into the United States. Citizens of countries that send relatively few immigrants to the United States can enter a lottery that grants winners permanent U.S. residency. Applicants must have at least a high school education or its equivalent, or relevant work experience. Just under 11.4 million applicants entered the 2016 lottery for 50,000 slots available to winners and their close family members, according to State Department figures. The visa program has succeeded in diversifying the mix of immigrants that come into the United States each year, but has also drawn criticism for being vulnerable to fraud and for posing national security risks. Trump said on Wednesday he would ask Congress to “immediately” initiate efforts to kill the program, and Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, who has long called for an end to diversity visas, said in a statement that they pose “a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer helped create the program in 1990 when he was a member of the House of Representatives. But he was also part of a group of lawmakers in 2013 who crafted a bipartisan immigration bill that would have done away with the program. That bill was passed by the Senate but was killed by the Republican-led House. Top congressional Democrats on Wednesday defended the program, saying it subjects all visa recipients “to the same stringent vetting as all other immigrant visa programs.” The only other known instance of a diversity visa beneficiary carrying out a deadly terrorist attack in the United States occurred in 2002. That year, an Egyptian man who had received a diversity visa through his wife years earlier shot and killed two people in a Los Angeles airport. The man had earlier sought asylum in the United States but was rejected. Ultimately, he was allowed to stay in the country after his wife won the lottery. As early as 2004, the State Department’s then-deputy inspector general, Anne Patterson, told Congress her office believed the diversity program “contains significant vulnerabilities to national security” and that terrorists could “attempt to use it to enter the United States as permanent residents.” The agency watchdog recommended barring citizens of countries that sponsor terrorism from the program. Over the years, government audits have exposed sophisticated fraud schemes targeting the program, including extortion rackets, sham marriages and the use of fake identification documents.  In 2007, Congress’s Government Accountability Office issued a report noting that federal law enforcers “believe that some individuals, including terrorists and criminals, could use fraudulent means to enter or remain in the United States.”  The report found, however, “no documented evidence” that diversity visa immigrants “posed a terrorist or other threat.”  A September 2013 State Department inspector general report found that “organized fraud rings masquerading as travel agencies” had hijacked the diversity visa program in Ukraine. Under the scheme, Ukrainians were entered in the lottery without their consent, and then held up for money in exchange for the chance to claim a visa or encouraged to enter into sham marriages if they won.

The interview was interrupted by a group of protestors chanting,  Say,  black lives matter!  In response to a question by one of the protestors about alleged instances of police brutality against African Americans, O Malley stated,  I think all of us have a responsibility to recognize the pain and grief caused by lives lost to violence. Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.  The statement is said to have drawn boos from the crowd. A minute or two later, O Malley apologized.The incident illustrated neatly illustrated the cultural divide between the left and the rest of America. Most people, without much of a thought, would agree that all lives matter, whether they belong to someone killed in an altercation with police or   say   a Marine gunned down by a terrorist. The crowd at Netroots Nation disagreed.More importantly, O Malley failed the  Sister Souljah  test by apologizing for saying something that should be axiomatic. A  Sister Souljah Moment  refers to an incident during the 1992 presidential campaign in which then Governor Bill Clinton condemned a rapper named Sister Souljah for racially incendiary lyrics in some of her songs. The statement caused a great deal of consternation, but Clinton received praise for taking on an extremist who was part of an important Democratic constituency.

The move comes on the same day that the president postponed his decision on whether or not to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, reports CNN. The goal of the agreement is to create  a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 C,  according to European Commission s website.Trump intended on making an announcement before attending the Group of Seven nations summit in Sicily, Italy, on May 26-27, but now, he s going to make a decision after the G7, explained White House press secretary Sean Spicer.Trump has a long history with Tiffany & Co; he named his youngest daughter after the iconic jeweler and the brand s flagship store is connected to Trump Tower in New York.

Many of us in the  new  media have been warning about their true motives for year.Now, instead of the climate crisis being caused by carbon emissions, it is being caused by inequality.On Monday, during a press conference at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Ms. Camille Risler, a representative of the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) which is an organization listed as an official consultant to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, stated that the cause of Climate Change is the unequal distribution of wealth, carbon, and power: This is the press conference of the Women and constituency.

U.S. aims for start this year on buying more military satellites,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force has developed a new framework for assessing the resilience of its satellites that should allow it to start the acquisition process for more military communication and missile detection satellites this autumn, a senior official said at the Farnborough Airshow this week. Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp and Raytheon Co are keeping a close eye on these satellite programs, which could be worth billions of dollars and represent the first big new business opportunities in the military space market for some time. U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the need to protect their military satellites - which are critical to being able to identify targets, navigate, communicate and operate drones - given the growing use of electronic jammers and other threats. Winston Beauchamp, the U.S. Air Force deputy undersecretary for space, told Reuters that officials had developed a new set of criteria over the past year to help military leaders determine their options for more satellites. The Air Force had previously looked at the options for follow-on satellites in both programs but until now had not included specific criteria for their resilience, or their ability to operate in the face of “hostile action or adverse conditions,” such as electromagnetic interference. Beauchamp said senior Pentagon leaders last week endorsed the work done so far on the framework and further work planned before it is presented to Defense Secretary Ash Carter for approval in the fall. Once that decision is made, the Air Force hopes to begin the long-awaited acquisition process to buy follow-on satellites for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system built by Lockheed Martin for protected satellite communications, and new missile warning satellites, also currently built by Lockheed under the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program.

The U.S. Air Force was also focused on increasing coordination and planning among allies for its space operations, as well as more multilateral wargaming and work on developing rules of engagement and joint concepts of operations. “We are thinking more broadly about how to conduct operations in a joint manner,” Beauchamp said. “In the past it was tacked on at the end.

Florida man pleads guilty in attempted hacking of Clinton Foundation,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Florida man pleaded guilty in a case stemming from an attempted hacking of the Clinton Foundation on Thursday, months after he was sentenced to 42 years in prison in the wake of child pornography discovered on his computers during the probe. Timothy Sedlak, 43, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to attempting to access protected computers without authorization. Prosecutors accused him of trying to gain access to an unnamed New York-based charitable organization’s network. “I knew that what I was doing was wrong,” Sedlak said in court. Neither prosecutors nor Sedlak named the organization from which he tried to get access to emails. In a court filing obtained by Reuters that summarized a U.S. Secret Service interview in 2015 with Sedlak, an agent said he was questioned about notes they found referencing former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. Sedlak, who called himself a private investigator, told the agents he was researching whether charities were unintentionally providing funding to Islamic militant groups, and said the Clintons “came up in his research,” the filing said. The filing’s description of the Clintons matched prosecutors’ descriptions of two previously unnamed individuals who were said to be executives at the charity and an “individual who has been publicly affiliated” with it. Chelsea Clinton is the vice chair of the foundation, which was started by her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Its full name is the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The filing was downloaded by Reuters on Feb. 3. It was later replaced by a redacted version removing the Clintons’ names. Clinton Foundation representatives did not respond to requests for comment. The investigation into Sedlak, of Ocoee, Florida, predated probes into cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies in January released an assessment indicating that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered  cyber attacks to help Republican Donald Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton. Sedlak launched about 390,000 unsuccessful attempts to gain unauthorized access to the charitable organization’s computer network, according to prosecutors. Following his arrest in 2015, authorities discovered files on his computers containing child pornography, including images depicting Sedlak sexually abusing a toddler, prosecutors said. Sedlak was separately charged in Florida, where a federal jury in Orlando in May found him guilty of charges he produced and possessed child pornography. He was sentenced in August to 42 years in prison. ",politicsNews,"February 23, 2017 ",1,2748

MOOCH SAYS BLACK KIDS AREN’T AS WELCOME IN MUSEUMS AS WHITE KIDS,"Our First Lady has taken time out from her self-appointed role as America s Food Nazi to fulfill her new role as  First Propagandist  in Obama s coordinated Race War on America First lady Michelle Obama used a speech Monday that was supposed to be celebrating the opening of a new museum to instead dig deeper the racial divide that s been growing ever wider during her husband s presidency.  Museums and concert halls,  she said, just don t welcome non-white visitors   especially children   the way they welcome whites. Speaking at the new Whitney museum in New York City s meat packing district last week, Obama said she grew up thinking that museums were not places  for someone who looks like me.   You see, there are so many kids in this country who look at places like museums and concert halls and other cultural centers and they think to themselves, well, that s not a place for me, for someone who looks like me, for someone who comes from my neighborhood. In fact, I guarantee you that right now, there are kids living less than a mile from here who would never in a million years dream that they would be welcome in this museum.  And growing up on the South Side of Chicago, I was one of those kids myself. So I know that feeling of not belonging in a place like this. And today, as first lady, I know how that feeling limits the horizons of far too many of our young people. According to Twitchy, Obama s remarks went largely unnoticed outside of the event, until a local radio host reported on  Museums as White Spaces. The first lady likely won t be answering that question any time soon. The tone of her speech was eerily similar to her husband s remarks during the launch of My Brother s Keeper Alliance in New York City on Monday. In the wake of racial tension and turmoil that has prompted riots throughout the country, President Obama unleashed some of his most overt commentary on race yet, as documented by Twitchy.

Lebanese court issues death sentence over 1982 Gemayel assassination,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s top court on Friday sentenced Habib Shartouni to death for the 1982 assassination of president-elect Bashir Gemayel, an event that was a turning point in Lebanon s 15-year civil war.  Shartouni, a member of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.  He was quoted in an interview in Lebanon s al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in Syria between 1994 and 2004. He did not reveal his present location.  Gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with Israel. His assassination occurred during Israel s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.  His death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on Sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many Lebanese and triggered the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut s Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.  Supporters of both Shartouni and Gemayel have protested outside the court during the hearings.  Gemayel was head of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, Muslim and Palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by Israel.  Its invasion was aimed at driving from Lebanon the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as well as the Syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.  After his assassination, Israel entered the capital Beirut and allowed Gemayel s militia, the Lebanese Forces, to access the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps, where their  fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.  Gemayel s family is still one of the most important in Lebanese politics, heading the Kataeb party that was founded by his father. The Lebanese Forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, Samir Geagea.  ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1,2078
May meets senior ministers to discuss Brexit divorce bill offer,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May met with senior members of her ministerial team on Monday to discuss their response to European Union demands for more detail on how much Britain is willing to pay as part of its Brexit divorce package. The EU told May on Friday that there was more work to be done to unlock the Brexit talks, repeating its early December deadline for her to flesh out Britain s opening offer on the financial settlement   thought to be worth around 20 billion euros ( 17.72 billion). May met with ministers amid expectations that she will offer the EU more than she committed to during a speech in Florence in September which failed to provide a meaningful breakthrough in the stalled negotiations. Despite growing pressure from businesses to show she can drive talks onto the subject of future trading relations with the EU, May s office gave little away as to the conclusions of Monday s meeting.  It remains our position that nothing s agreed until everything s agreed in negotiations with the EU,  a source from May s office said.  As the Prime Minister said this morning, the UK and the EU should step forward together.  Media reports said the ministers had agreed to make an offer which would increase the value of May s existing commitment but  gave no specific details. The BBC reported that no specific amounts had been discussed during the meeting. May has repeatedly signalled that she will increase an initial offer that is thought to be worth about a third of what Brussels wants. But, wary of the need to keep the peace in her Conservative Party, which has a powerful faction insisting Britain should be paying the minimum possible to the EU and using the cash offer to leverage better exit terms, May has avoided publicly discussing any figure. Instead, she has said Britain will meet its financial obligations to the bloc   a commitment which remains wide open to interpretation.  Finance minister Philip Hammond said on Sunday that the government would submit its proposal to the EU before a Dec. 14-15 summit.  He warned Britain would be prepared to negotiate hard over the bill, acknowledging differences of opinion with the EU on the value of liabilities, and whether Britain was even liable at all for some elements of the total amount mooted by Brussels.

MN: Mayoral Candidate Wants To DISARM COPS After Muslim Cop Kills Unarmed Woman," Minneapolis mayoral candidate Raymond Dehn proposes disarming cops in wake of Damond shooting. Only one year ago, the FBI named Minneapolis, MN as one of the most dangerous cities in America. Minneapolis is also home to the largest Somali refugee population in America. According to the Star Tribune, Minnesota remains near the top among states for refugee resettlement, measured as a share of state population. It is also the top destination for refugees who move from the state where they were originally resettled. Of the 2,338 total, almost 45 percent hailed from Somalia.In the wake of the shooting death of Australian Justine Damond, Raymond Dehn, a candidate in the race for Minneapolis mayor has proposed disarming police officersThe Australian woman was shot dead by police officer Mohamed Noor after calling 911 to report a suspected sexual assault. Officers don t need to carry a gun on their person all the time,  said Raymond Dehn, one of the frontrunners in the mayoral race and who currently serves in the Minnesota House of Representatives. Currently, officers carry all sorts of assault weapons in their cars. So why can t one of those weapons be the side arm (such as a baton that sits on a holster)? It s important that we begin to have a conversation, and I would say that all things are on the table. We live in a culture where guns are pervasive. Cops carrying guns is part of a larger conversation about guns in our society,  he said, according to the Star Tribune .Better yet, how about just disarm the cops who, like Mohamed Noor, are only on the force to demonstrate Minneapolis  commitment to  diversity,  rather than because they re competent to be police officers?Even better still, how about hire and fire cops based on merit, rather than for their value as trophy Muslims or Somalis on the force?Nah   that would be  Islamophobic.

 Hateful Arizona Pastor Deported From Botswana After Saying Gays Should Be ‘Stoned to Death’ (VIDEO),"Wouldn t it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, that s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.Anderson s road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a  roundabout  way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,  Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana)   and if you ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his  thing.  The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a  prohibited immigrant :Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana  Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be  stoned to death.  Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn t advocate violence, the victims were  disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway. Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does),  if it did then yes I would condone it  because  the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God. In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country s acceptance of  f*ggots, has called the Orlando massacre  good news  because a bunch of  f*ggots  died (he later expanded on that by adding that  perfect Christians  would  bathe  in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world  to cure AIDS.

Australian medical group wants access to Manus Island asylum seekers,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia s main medical association called on Saturday for the government to allow independent doctors and other health experts to help more than 400 asylum seekers languishing inside a recently closed detention center in Papua New Guinea. The asylum seekers have shut themselves inside the Australian-run Manus Island Centre for the past 18 days, defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to close it in a standoff the United Nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis . Australia has shut access to the center, and staff, including doctors, have left, leaving the men without sufficient food, clean water, power or medical care. Members of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) voted unanimously on Saturday to call on the government to grant access to the center so doctors could assess the men s health, wellbeing and living conditions.  The AMA has made many representations on this matter, both publicly and in private but, with a worsening and more dangerous situation emerging on Manus, the federal council strongly believes that urgent action and answers are needed,  AMA President Michael Gannon said.  It is our responsibility as a nation with a strong human rights record to ensure that we look after the health and wellbeing of these men, and provide them with safe and hygienic living conditions.  Government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment. Australia s  sovereign borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, has been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but has bipartisan political support in Australia. The 421 asylum seekers on Manus island say they fear violent reprisals from the community if they move to transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the United States. Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz said via text message on Saturday that PNG officials had started to dismantle the center s perimeter fences and food was running low.  We are waiting drinking from the rainwater ... it s tense feeling, we don t have any idea what PNG will do to us. Their attitude toward us they are really aggressive,  Aziz said. PNG s Supreme Court ruled last year that the center breached its laws and fundamental human rights, leading to the decision to close it. New Zealand has offered to accept 150 of the men, but Australia has declined the offer saying the priority was an existing refugee swap deal negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year.   Under that deal, up to 1,250 asylum seekers could be sent to the United States and Australia will in turn accept refugees from Central America. ",worldnews,"November 18, 2017 ",1,2760

Philadelphia prosecutor will not seek reelection after ethics fine,"(Reuters) - Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said on Friday he would not run for reelection this year, saying he made “regrettable mistakes” when he accepted gifts that resulted in the city ethics board ordering him to pay a record fine. Williams, a Democrat, had already been expected to face several challengers in the May primary election for the top law enforcement position in the fifth-most-populous U.S. city. Last month, Williams agreed to pay $62,000 in civil penalties to end an investigation by the Philadelphia ethics board into his failure to disclose gifts including NBA basketball tickets, cash and lodging. The ethics board said it was the largest amount in penalties it had imposed in its 10-year history.  The gifts prompted the FBI to interview members of the prosecutor’s staff and at least one of the gift-givers, and the bureau is investigating a nonprofit Williams founded, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. Williams apologized at a televised news conference. “My decisions to accept gifts and fail to report them brought much embarrassment, shame and adverse publicity to me and, unfortunately, to the office which I love,” he said. “For this, I will always hold deep regret in my heart.” Another top Pennsylvania prosecutor, former state attorney general Kathleen Kane, resigned in August after she was convicted of leaking confidential grand jury information and then lying about it to investigators. Kane, a Democrat, was sentenced to 10 to 23 months in prison. Williams, first elected in 2009 and reelected in 2013, is the first black district attorney in the history of Pennsylvania.  His 600-person office handles 40,000 criminal cases a year, from minor crimes to murders. He said he was proud of changes he had made in the office, such as involving senior prosecutors in the earliest stages of cases. ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2017 ",1,1963

Senator Flake expects more Republicans to denounce Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Jeff Flake said on Wednesday he expects more  Republican colleagues to speak out against Donald Trump’s behavior and policies, one day after denouncing the Republican president in a fiery speech. Flake had accused Trump of “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior and said his “instinct to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking people.” His condemnation in a speech on the Senate floor came just hours after Senator Bob Corker, another Republican, lashed out at Trump as “an utterly untruthful president” who was debasing the United States. Flake, who is not seeking re-election in Arizona next year, said on Wednesday he thinks other Republican lawmakers will join him in standing up to Trump. “Privately a number of my colleagues have expressed concern about the direction of our politics and the behavior of the president,” Flake told CNN. “There comes a tipping point where you realize we just can’t continue to normalize this kind of behavior so I do think we’ll have more people stand up in the coming months.” Trump responded by saying Flake’s feud with him probably would have cost him with voters and that he would have lost if he had sought re-election. “He was against me before he ever knew me,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday. “He would have never won. He did the smart thing for himself. This way he can get out somewhat gracefully.” Despite control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, Republicans have yet to deliver any major legislative victories this year on priorities such as tax reform, healthcare and immigration. Republican Senator John McCain, who is fighting brain cancer, also has spoken out sharply against Trump.  But most Republicans in Congress have either remained silent or tried to play down divisions inside their party as Trump has attacked lawmakers, the media and others he sees as opposing or trying to undermine his presidency. “I think people should settle their differences personally,” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. “I think it’s better that way. I think it’s in our interest to have party unity so that we can continue to work forward on an agenda.” So far, the fierce criticism from Flake and Corker has drawn more praise from Democrats than from fellow Republicans. “History will judge Senator Flake and Senator Corker as two men of the greatest conscience to have graced this chamber on either side of the aisle in a long time,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.

U.S. top court rejects challenge to political ad disclosure rules,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld federal disclosure rules for political advertising, rejecting an appeal by a Denver-based libertarian think tank that wanted to run an ad without being forced to divulge its major donors. The Denver-based Independence Institute sued the Federal Election Commission, arguing the law requiring such disclosure violated its free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. The Supreme Court affirmed a lower court’s ruling last year in favor of the commission. It was the latest in a decade-long series of cases brought by conservatives aiming to roll back federal campaign finance restrictions. The Independence Institute was supported in the case by influential Republican and conservative voices including Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the  Judicial Watch legal activist group as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group. The institute, ahead of the 2014 congressional elections, had sought to run a radio advertisement about increasing prison costs, telling listeners to urge their Colorado U.S. senators to support sentencing reform. Because the ad mentioned a senator by name in the lead up to an election, it triggered a provision in the 2002 campaign finance statute known as the McCain-Feingold law requiring the institute to file with the election commission and disclose any donors supporting the ad. The law was enacted to combat an explosion of what is known as “soft money” in campaigns through so-called sham issue advertisements, which cloaked partisan advocacy in discussions of public policy. Though the Supreme Court allowed unlimited campaign spending by corporations and unions in its landmark 2010 decision in the Citizens United v Federal Election Commission case, the court also upheld disclosure requirements for campaign ads. The Federal Election Commission said that for more than a century federal law has required organizations that influence elections to disclose information about their funding sources, a principle upheld in the Citizens United ruling. The Independence Institute sued in federal court in Washington in a bid to keep the names of its donors secret, arguing that its proposed ad focused on the sentencing reforms that senators were considering, not any senator’s re-election campaign.  Last October, a three-judge panel of the federal court ruled against the group, saying it would be impossible to distinguish genuine issue ads that reference candidates from campaign-style ads that openly promote or disparage a candidate.  ",politicsNews,"February 27, 2017 ",1,2639
French government dampens Corsican nationalists' autonomy hopes,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s government on Tuesday ruled out major concessions towards autonomy sought by Corsica s nationalists after they won a regional election, but said it was open to talks that took account of the island s distinctive character. The nationalists on Sunday won two thirds of the seats in the new regional council that takes office on Jan. 1. Their ambitions are relatively modest among the wave of secessionist movements that have sprung up in parts of Europe as its traditional political forces have lost traction.  Unlike Catalonia s nationalists, they do not target outright independence, but they do seek official status for the Corsican language and a greater say on fiscal issues.  Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said there were Corsican  specifics  to be taken into account in the discussions that Paris holds with all new regional authorities.  (But) let s be clear ... this was not a referendum or a vote on autonomy or independence,  he told France 2 TV. The Corsican nationalists also want to be able to decide who can buy properties and they seek liberty for those they call political prisoners, who have been condemned for attacks or are awaiting judgment. The sun-drenched island, the birthplace of Napoleon and known as much over recent decades for its sometimes violent independence movements as for its stunning landscapes, has long been a thorn in the side of French governments. Clandestine group the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica (FLNC) laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four-decade long rebellion, in a major shift that helped boost the popularity of the moderate nationalists who won Sunday s election.  Asked about prisoners, Griveaux said:  The law must be respected. When there have been crimes and a court ruling, when people have been condemned, the sentence should be carried out.  Asked about Corsican becoming an official language on the island alongside French, Griveaux said provision had already been made in various regions to allow the use of a local language, for instance in some schools. But  the language of the Republic is French,  he added.  Political analyst Andre Fazi, a lecturer at the University of Corsica, said it would be hard for the nationalists to get what they wanted.  But with Sunday s election win, it would also be risky for the government to not do anything,  he said.  Shutting the door completely could boost calls for outright independence, as was the case in Catalonia.  In a sign that the government might be taking this into account, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday called nationalist leader Gilles Simeoni to congratulate him on his win and told him he was willing to see him soon in Paris.

MORE TRANSPARENCY: CLINTON’S REFUSE TO RELEASE HILLARY’S HEALTH RECORDS,"Karl Rove is suggesting Hillary suffered brain damage following her blood clot.On Sunday, Hillary Clinton s campaign manager would not commit to releasing her health records during the 2016 campaign.Face the Nation host John Dickerson pointed out that  Hillary Clinton had a big health scare when she was secretary of state  and asked campaign manager Robby Mook,  will she release her medial records as part of this campaign? I will let Hillary decide that,  Mook answered.  But I can tell you she has been hitting the campaign trail hard. In 2012, Clinton had to delay her Benghazi testimony to Congress after she fell and suffered a concussion. She later was treated for a blood clot in her brain, which experts said could have been  life threatening.  Though Clinton joked about her  cracked head  in emails that the State Department recently released, Bill Clinton revealed last year that Hillary s injuries  required six months of very serious work to get over. On the stump this weekend, Clinton tried to deflect concerns about her age by saying that she would be the  youngest woman president  if elected to the White House.Via:Breitbart News",politics,"Jun 16, 2015",0,1221
Clinton leads Trump by six points in latest Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a 6-percentage-point lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Tuesday. Clinton’s support has ranged from 41 percent to 44 percent since late July, and was about 41 percent in the Aug. 11-15 online poll. Trump’s support has experienced wider shifts ranging from 33 percent to 39 percent while his campaign has endured controversies and distractions in recent weeks. He is favored by about 35 percent of likely voters, according to the most recent poll. Trump has caused divisions in the Republican Party with his strong anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, and faced criticism from both parties earlier this month for a days-long feud with the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, 70 Republicans, including former members of Congress and Republican National Committee staff, wrote a letter calling for the RNC to stop helping Trump, whose actions they said were “divisive and dangerous.” The number of likely voters who picked neither Clinton nor Trump in the poll was nearly 24 percent.  At this point in 2012, President Barack Obama was ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by nearly the same margin, favored by 46 percent of likely voters to Romney’s 41 percent, with about 13 percent picking neither candidate. Obama and Romney swapped the lead in the poll several times through the summer and early fall before the president took and held the lead in late October. In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that gave respondents the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton also led Trump by 6 percentage points. Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with 8 percentage points. Stein had about 2 percentage points.  The Aug. 11-15 polls surveyed a sample of 1,132 and 1,131 likely voters, respectively, and had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1,2080
U.S. EPA bans some scientists from independent advisory boards,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Tuesday it will bar certain scientists from serving on its independent advisory boards, a move critics say could open the way to more industry-friendly advisors on the panels. The EPA barred scientists who have won agency-awarded grants in the past, billing the step as a way to preserve the independence and diversity of the boards, which provide the scientific input for agency decisions around pollution and climate change regulation. “Whatever science comes out of EPA, (it) shouldn’t be political science,” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, said in a release, adding that committee members will be “financially independent” from the agency.  Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate environment committee, said Pruitt’s decision was part of an EPA effort to “delegitimize the work of nonpartisan scientists.” Carper added, “this crusade endangers the health of every American, and it cannot be tolerated.” Pruitt signaled the move during a speech last week at the conservative Heritage Foundation, when he questioned the independence of scientists who have won past EPA research grants, and promised to “fix” the situation. During his election campaign last year, Republican President Donald Trump promised to roll back environmental regulations from Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, including those limiting carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming, to make government more friendly to the drilling, mining, and manufacturing businesses.     The advisory boards were created by Congress to serve as a check on EPA policies and research. They include the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the Board of Scientific Counselors.  Last year, the SAB questioned an EPA report that concluded that hydraulic fracturing - an oil and gas drilling technology that frees petroleum from underground shale formations - had no ""widespread impacts"" on drinking water despite evidence of problems in several states. (reut.rs/2h2GTrD) In June, Pruitt decided not to renew the terms of nine members of a separate body, the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors. One of those members, Michigan State University professor of community sustainability Robert Richardson, told Reuters the move came as a surprise because the work they were doing was “apolitical.”     The EPA is also expected to announce three new members of the Clean Air advisory committee on Tuesday. Pruitt is an outspoken doubter of mainstream climate science, a consensus of scientists that carbon dioxide from human use of fossil fuels is a primary driver of global warming, triggering more frequent volatile storms, sea level rise, and droughts.  Pruitt has said he wants to set up a televised debate about the science of climate change between scientists who believe it is driven by humans and those that do not.

Obama budget to adjust health insurance 'Cadillac tax': adviser,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will propose tailoring the controversial “Cadillac tax” on expensive private health insurance plans to reflect regional differences when he releases his 2017 budget plan next week, a senior White House adviser said in an article released on Wednesday. Obama's proposal would reduce the bite of the unpopular tax by raising the threshold where it takes effect in areas where healthcare is particularly expensive, according to the article in the New England Journal of Medicine co-written by Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. (bit.ly/1QdGlDG) The tax on high-cost employer-based healthcare plans, passed as part of the president’s 2010 Affordable Care Act and set to take effect in 2018, has generated growing opposition in part because labor unions say it could encourage employers to cut back on health insurance plans for workers. The tax was expected to raise some $87 billion a year to help pay for the reform generally known as Obamacare.   White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Americans Tell Senate GOP To Let President Obama Pick Supreme Court Nominee (IMAGE),"Sorry, Republicans. The American people have spoken and you lose.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republicans have insisted that President Obama should let whoever wins the 2016 presidential election nominate the new Supreme Court Justice. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even vowed not to even consider anyone Obama picks, which is a complete betrayal of the Constitution and everything Scalia stood for.And the American people overwhelmingly disagree with the GOP.Not only is President Obama serving out the final year of the second term a majority of Americans elected him to serve, a new poll shows that Americans still want him to the job despite what Republicans want.A new Rasmussen poll indicates that Americans not only think President Obama should make the pick, they say Senate Republicans should NOT block any nomination Obama puts forth.All told, 51 percent of Americans say President Obama is still the commander-in-chief, therefore he should get to replace Scalia, while only 43 percent say he shouldn t. An even bigger percentage of people, 53 percent, say Senate Republicans should not stand in his way. Only 35 percent say Senate Republicans should remain the obstructionist assholes they are.Here s a chart showing the poll results via ThinkProgress.The poll represents the opinions of likely voters, which means Republicans should probably reconsider their stance since any political stunt could hurt them on Election Day. People are sick and tired of GOP obstructionism and blocking President Obama from filling a vacant seat on the Supreme Court out of some sick political game won t impress voters at all.But rather than listen to the American people, Republicans will probably ignore them like they did when they listened to Ted Cruz and shut down the government. If Republicans really care about not getting their asses totally handed to them at the voting booth this November, they need to suck it up, respect that President Obama is still their president, and give any nominee he puts forward a fair confirmation hearing. That s what the American people want, that s what the American people should get.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"February 18, 2016",0,2250
BOOM! KELLYANNE CONWAY Schools CNN’s Anderson Cooper On The Comey Firing [Video],"Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties.

"Maryland, District of Columbia sue over payments to Trump hotels","(Reuters) - The attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming that government payments to President Donald Trump’s businesses violate the U.S. Constitution. Payments to the president’s enterprises from foreign and domestic governments through his hospitality empire draw business away from Maryland and D.C. venues and put local governments under pressure to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment, according to the complaint.  Foreign and domestic government payments to Trump’s businesses were the target of a similar lawsuit brought in January by plaintiffs including an ethics nonprofit group, and Democratic lawmakers have blasted them as potential corrupting influences on Trump. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require the customers to identify themselves.  “Every time the president has spoken about drawing a line between his presidency and his businesses, he’s walked those promises back,” said D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said at a news conference on Monday. The case by Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, both Democrats, has a better chance in court as the first government action over allegations that Trump, a Republican, violated the Constitution’s so-called emoluments clauses, legal experts said.  Democratic attorneys general have taken a lead role in challenging Trump policies, successfully blocking executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries.  The Maryland and D.C. attorneys general are seeking an order in U.S. District Court in Maryland preventing Trump from continuing to receive government payments beyond his salary.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday rejected the claim that Trump’s business interests violated the Constitution and said “partisan politics” were behind the lawsuit. Trump’s lawyers will likely move to dismiss the case, he said. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Trump’s ownership in hundreds of businesses hurts Maryland and D.C. and violates “emoluments” clauses in the Constitution that bar the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval as well as from domestic governments under any circumstances, according to the  complaint.  While Trump turned over management of the umbrella Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, he still owns his businesses, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and can draw revenue from them at any time. The attorneys general argued they had standing to sue Trump because their citizens will be harmed if payments to Trump are used to influence his allocation of federal funds. They also said local hospitality companies, including state-owned facilities, are being harmed.  The Justice Department on Friday argued in the other lawsuit that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue because they cannot allege enough specific harm caused by Trump’s businesses.  The attorneys general have a better chance of establishing standing, legal scholars said, although they are divided over whether the AGs will ultimately succeed. Plaintiffs typically only have standing to file lawsuits under federal law if they can show they have been injured and a court ruling would remedy the harm.  Fordham Law School Professor Jed Shugerman said state governments’ special duty to protect their citizens means they face a lower bar to standing in federal court, and the AG lawsuit should proceed.  However, Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said it was unclear that this harm could be remedied by a favorable ruling.  The government has also said Trump hotel revenue does not fit the definition of an improper payment under the Constitution. Payments to Trump’s hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president, the government said. “If the Justice Department is correct, the emoluments clause has no meaning whatsoever,” said Frosh, the Maryland official.  “The president can stand over here with his president of the United States hat and he’s not allowed to take payments. But he takes a step over here and puts on his businessman hat, they can funnel as much money to him as they want.” ",politicsNews,"June 12, 2017 ",1,4468
U.S. appeals court removes new voter-intimidation rules in Ohio,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won a legal battle on Sunday when a U.S. appeals court in Ohio removed new restrictions on partisan poll watchers that Democrats had sought to prevent Election Day voter intimidation. The rules overturned by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals would have imposed greater penalties on people who harass voters during Tuesday’s election. Voter intimidation already is prohibited under U.S. law but Democrats have pushed for greater restrictions in Ohio and five other battleground states, citing concerns that Trump’s heated rhetoric might inspire Election Day chaos. On the campaign trail, Trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare.  On Friday U.S. District Court Judge James Gwin imposed new restrictions on those who monitor voting activity, saying they may not interrogate voters within 100 feet of a polling place, block them from entering, or photograph them as they come and go. Those found to violate the rules could be held in contempt of court. The Trump campaign had argued that those restrictions were not justified, given that there had been no reported instances of voter harassment in the state so far.  “In the end, plaintiff’s case rested on rhetoric, not evidence,” Trump attorney Chad Readler wrote in a court filing on Saturday. The appeals court sided with Trump, lifting the new rules two days before Election Day. The ruling came before Democrats had a chance to respond to Readler’s motion and the party said it may appeal. “We are stunned that a court would rule without even allowing one of the parties to file a memo explaining their case, but that is exactly what the Sixth Circuit has done in this decision. We are exploring our options to reverse this unfortunate ruling,” Ohio Democratic Party spokeswoman Kirstin Alvanitakis said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump given unverified reports that Russia had damaging details about him,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Classified documents that the heads of four U.S. intelligence agencies presented last week to President-elect Donald Trump included claims that Russian intelligence operatives have compromising information about him, two U.S. officials said Tuesday evening. They told Reuters the claims, which one called “unsubstantiated,” were contained in a two-page memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that U.S. intelligence officials presented to Trump and President Barack Obama last week. Trump responded on Tuesday evening in a tweet calling the reports: “FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of the officials, both of whom requested anonymity to discuss classified matters, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other U.S. agencies are continuing to investigate the credibility and accuracy of the claims. They are included in opposition research reports made available last year to Democrats and U.S. officials by a former British intelligence official, most of whose past work U.S. officials consider credible. The official said investigators so far have been unable to confirm the material about Trump financial and personal entanglements with Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of Russian intelligence. Some material in the reports produced by the former British intelligence officer has proved to be erroneous, the official said. The FBI declined comment. The charges that Russia attempted to compromise New York real estate businessman Trump were presented to the FBI and other U.S. government officials last summer and have been circulating for months. The FBI initially took the material seriously, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, which was first reported by CNN.  However, the FBI failed to act on the material, and the former British intelligence officer broke off contact about three weeks before the November election, they said.  The warning of information about Russia’s compromising claims follows growing U.S. intelligence and law enforcement concerns about what Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has called “multifaceted” Russian influence and espionage operations in Europe and the United States.  In addition to hacking computer networks and spreading propaganda and fake news, it includes efforts to cultivate business and political leaders and find compromising personal, financial and other information on persons of interest, U.S. intelligence officials said. The classified briefings last week were presented to Obama and Trump by Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. U.S. intelligence chiefs included a classified summary of the material to make Trump aware that it is circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress, government officials and others, one of the officials said. An unclassified intelligence report released on Friday concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to help Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign. The report said U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that as part of the effort Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks and others to release emails it hacked from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats.

 Muhammad Ali Jr. Detained AGAIN At Airport Right After Testifying About First Detention,"One day after he testified about being stopped by immigration officials under Donald Trump s Muslim ban, the son of boxing legend Muhammad Ali was detained by immigration officials again   this time on a domestic flight.Muhammad Ali Jr. traveled to Washington on Wednesday to testify about the first time he was detained on his way back from a Black History Month speech he gave with his mother in Jamaica. Ali Jr. was initially detained at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on February 7 and questioned for two hours, with officials grilling him with ever-important questions like  Are you a Muslim  and  where did you get your name.  This time, the boxer s son didn t even make it to Florida.While attempting to board a flight home in a Washington-area airport, the TSA immediately took issue with his identification:When Mr. Ali, whose father died last year, arrived at Reagan National Airport in Washington on Friday for a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., he gave his Illinois identification card to a JetBlue agent to get his boarding pass, said his lawyer, Chris Mancini, who was traveling with him and witnessed the episode. Almost immediately, Mr. Ali was told that there was a problem and that the agent needed to call the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Mancini said.Mr. Ali, 44, was asked his date of birth, where he was born and his Social Security number, Mr. Mancini said. After answering the questions, he was told that his Illinois-issued identification card, which expires in 2019 but is not a driver s license, was invalid for flying. The same state ID from Illinois that he traveled to Washington on was rejected,  Mr. Mancini said in an interview on Friday night. Mr. Ali then produced his United States passport, which was accepted, and went through security and boarded the flight with his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the second wife of Muhammad Ali, and Mr. Mancini.Mr. Mancini said that the episode lasted between 20 and 25 minutes.  This whole thing smacks of some sort of retaliation for his testimony,  he said.The TSA, as is typical, absolved itself of all wrongdoing . Upon arriving at the airline check-in counter, a call was made to confirm Mr. Ali s identity with T.S.A. officials,  the agency says.  When Mr. Ali arrived at the checkpoint, his large jewelry alarmed the checkpoint scanner. He received a targeted pat-down in the area of his jewelry to clear the alarm and was cleared to catch his flight. This is now the second time over the course of two separate Muslim bans in which a well-known figure was singled out seemingly for no better reason than his name. This does not keep America safe   it makes everyday Americans afraid to travel if their skin is too dark or if they might appear too  Muslimy  to the unwashed bigots who regularly staff TSA checkpoints across the nation.If this is what America looks like when it s  Great Again,  then maybe we should stop.

Democratic senator tussles with U.S. Treasury secretary over communication,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee’s top Democrat tussled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a hearing on Thursday over the flow of information from his agency, and later asked if President Donald Trump, a Republican, had ordered him to restrain communications with Democrats. “Are you aware of any White House guidance formal or informal urging administration officials not to respond to or to delay in responding to Democratic senators?” Senator Sherrod Brown, a liberal Democrat, asked Mnuchin toward the end of the hearing. “I am not,” Mnuchin answered. Brown said earlier in the hearing that he had written to Mnuchin on March 2 asking about “potential conflicts of interest and ownership in the administration,” but did not receive a response. He then pressed Mnuchin to send the committee “a complete list of Trump business associates and financial ties.”  Mnuchin said that before the hearing he had checked that Treasury staff “had fully responded to all the inquiries from you and the committee” and asked Brown to send a note reminding him to deliver the list. While other senators began questioning Mnuchin, the two took the argument off-line, with Treasury emailing reporters a brief statement saying that it had responded to Brown’s letter on March 31. Brown’s office then circulated the response it had received, which generally discussed compliance with conflict of interest laws and lacked any details. Brown’s office said Treasury’s brief letter had not answered his questions. The senator also did not seem reassured that Treasury was not dragging its feet in communicating with Democrats. After he asked about possible guidance from the White House, Brown pressed: “Will you commit to responding to...members of both parties of this committee in a timely manner to all requests for information?” “I will,” Mnuchin responded. A Treasury spokesman did not replay to questions about any formal or informal White House orders on communication. ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2017 ",1,2067
More than 60 killed in air strike on Syrian market town,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The death toll from air strikes on a Syrian town in a  de-escalation zone  has risen to 61, a war monitor said on Tuesday, a demonstration of the fragile state of areas set up in attempt to ease the violence. Jihadist rebels blamed Russian warplanes of carrying out Monday s attack and said they would fight back against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s forces and his Russian and Iranian  backers in the six-year-old conflict. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three air strikes hit the market in Atareb, west of Aleppo,  and killed at least 61 people. Atareb is inside what is known as a de-escalation zone under an agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran to reduce the bloodshed. But despite the diplomatic efforts, fighting continues in many areas, including Aleppo, Idlib, Raqqa, Deir al-Zor and Hama.  (The zones) did de-escalate fighting,  U.N. humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland told Reuters. But lately,  there has been increased fighting also.  The zones were set up under the Astana process, a series of talks in the capital of Kazakhstan between Russia and Iran, and the rebels  supporter Turkey. They agreed in September to deploy observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in Syria s Idlib province, which is largely under the control of Islamist insurgents. Following the air strikes, the Tahrir al-Sham jihadist alliance denounced the ceasefire talks and pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies.  This aggression and crimes confirms for us that there is no solution with the colonizers without fighting and struggling,  it said. Tahrir al-Sham includes the group formerly known as the Nusra Front, which changed its name last year when it broke formal ties to al Qaeda. ",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1,1830

The speech was more sober and low energy than most Trump speeches have been, and used more sophisticated language than Trump s traditional events.But he still stuck his foot in it.During the speech, Trump made a reference to helping  our African-American people  who live in the  inner city  that have been  mistreated  for so long.Coming just a few days after referring to a black man in one of his rallies as  my African-American,  the comment hit a sour note for many people, especially as it sounded like a possessive reference to ownership.Twitter users took Trump to task for the comment almost immediately after he said it:Trump: It's gonna be great.

He described Mexican immigrants as  criminals  and  rapists,  while also calling for a ban on Muslim travel to the United States.His campaign has also received support from white supremacists, who have bankrolled robocalls in his favor and a super PAC backing his election. Trump was endorsed by notorious former klansman David Duke and his campaign arranged for a white supremacist radio show to get credentials to cover them.Trump even rejected multiple opportunities in an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper to denounce and reject support from Duke. Instead he stubbornly tried to deflect the question.His most diehard supporters have echoed Trump s rhetoric, while the most extreme have even assaulted black protesters at his rallies, and in one instance a Latino man was beat up and assaulted by a pair of men who cited Trump as they engaged in violence.So, tell us again how The Donald is not a racist.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 7, 2016",0,3057
 Trump’s Own Diversity Council Member Fact-Checks Him On DACA: ‘He’s A Liar’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s team is turning against him at record speed, and he s just been sent a strong message by a member of his own diversity council.Recently, Trump announced that he is going to get rid of the DACA program, marking his latest attack on immigrants. While much of America is furious over this, it seems like Trump has pissed off even his own team. Javier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and diversity council member to Trump, just destroyed Trump for recently claiming that he  loved  the 800,000+ people in the program. Palomarez pretty much tore Trump apart on CNN as he told Jim Acosta: If he gets rid of DACA, he s showing that he s a liar. He has said to this country that he is going to try to protect the people in the DACA program, that he was focused on getting rid of criminals. Palomarez made sure to point out the positives of DACA recipients, which includes high graduation and employment rates   far from the  drug dealers  and  rapists  labels that Trump had made up for immigrants during his 2016 presidential campaign. Palomarez even stated that he was so disgusted with Trump s announcement that he is considering resigning from Trump s diversity council. He said: I m gonna work right up until the bloody end to try to convince this president to do the right thing by these 800,000 Dreamers who reside in this country. Trump s policies and plans are disgusting even members of his own team. So far, any of Trump s staff have resigned over his inhumane ideas, and there aren t any signs of this pattern slowing down. Trump is a nightmare for any administration members that give a damn about human rights, and it s clear that many members are struggling with the lack of morale.

Hillary Scolds Major Contributors To Terrorist Groups…Doesn’t Mention They Gave Over $67 MILLION To Clinton Slush Fund,"Behold The Democrats best choice for President of The United States of America. Hillary should be on bloody knees every day thanking her lucky stars she s not a Republican .Hillary Clinton gave a speech Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relation, where she outlined her genius plan to defeat ISIS. (Step 1: Defeat ISIS.) She also offered a few more specific proposals [emphasis added]:When it comes to terrorist financing, we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions. The U.N. Security Council should update its terrorism sanctions. They have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities, but we have to place more obligations on countries to police their own banks, and the United States, which has quite a record of success in this area, can share more intelligence to help other countries. And once and for all, the Saudis, the Qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as the schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path to radicalization.Clinton is right about the fact that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have for years funneled money to terrorist groups, essentially bribing them to ensure that they don t cause trouble in their incestual oligarchies. She is certainly right that these oil-rich countries have made a habit of giving away money to powerful interest groups in an effort to curry favor. Some of those groups happen to be comprised of terrorists, while others are charitable foundations founded by a former United States president whose wife is currently seeking the Democratic Party s nomination for the same position in 2016.Here s how much those three countries and their affiliated entities have donated to the Clinton Foundation:Qatar   Up to $5.8 million United Arab Emirates   Up to $11.5 million Saudi Arabia   Up to $50 millionThe gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors.Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as  intelligent, forward looking  investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillary s top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York University campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family.Hillary is right, the time has come for Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia to stop using their oil wealth to buy influence and protection from special interests.

BRAINIAC PROTESTERS VANDALIZE…Attempt to Take Down ‘Peace’ Monument,"This is what mob rule does It s lawless idiots who decided to vandalize and tear down a  Peace  Monument in Atlanta. Has it come to this? Where does this end?THE PARAGRAPH BELOW FROM THE AJC IS THE MOST DISTURBING:A protester was hurt by metal falling from the edifice as the group tried to tear it down, AJC photographer John Spink reported Sunday night. Tensions rose as the lone policeman on the scene was surrounded by black-clad Antifa protesters shouting  pig.  Black Lives Matter protesters put themselves between the police officer and the Antifa crowd, and the gathering soon dispersed.Protesters vandalized and attempted to take down the Peace Monument in Piedmont Park in Atlanta on Sunday, mistaking it for a pro-Confederate statue. The protesters were marching in response to the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday where one woman died after being deliberately hit by a car, and two law enforcement personnel were killed when the helicopter they were in crashed. The Atlanta march traveled from Woodruff Park to Piedmont Park Sunday, where some damaged the Peace Monument, erected in 1911,  a blog on the Atlanta Journal-Constitution website said.  The sculpture features an angel standing above a Confederate soldier, guiding him to lay down his weapon. But the memorial attacked by protesters   some dressed in black and wearing masks   was erected to encourage healing and reconciliation. ATLANTA HISTORY BUFF FILLS US IN:  These guys realized a national healing needed to take place,  said Kennedy, a history buff who keeps the three-volume set  The Chronicles of the Old Guard  on his bookshelf.  They organized a peace tour of the North, which is really remarkable. These were guys who fought in the Civil War, against Union troops. They would go meet with Union soldiers and began to repair those fissures the war created. It speaks to what we call the Atlanta spirit. Read more: Breitbart",politics,"Aug 17, 2017",0,2000
Libyans flee by boat amid 'terrible' violence at home,"ABOARD SEEFUCHS RESCUE SHIP (Reuters) - Just before the sun dipped into the Mediterranean on Saturday, rescuers spotted a tiny wooden boat on the horizon. It turned out to contain five young Libyans fleeing violence and turmoil who were waving their arms for help. The crew of the Seefuchs plucked them from the old fishing boat, gave them water and couscous and one of the men, 26-year-old Hamza Tekbali, explained why they had fled their country.  Libya is terrible,  Tekbali told Reuters as he waited to be transferred to an Italian coast guard vessel.  In Libya, if you do not kill, they will kill you,  he said, adding that he feared he would be sent straight back home. The Seefuchs, a ship operated by the humanitarian group Sea-Eye, carried the men to Catania, Italy, on Wednesday along with 16 other Libyans picked up on Sunday. Already this year some 800 Libyans have reached Italy by sea, more than double the number for the whole of 2016, according to data collected by the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). The number is a fraction of the more than 100,000 non-Libyan migrants who have come to Italy from the country since January, but it suggests that the situation is deteriorating for Libyans in their own country. Migrants traveling through Libya from elsewhere in Africa en route to Europe already face terrible conditions.  For the past few months we have seen more Libyans,  said Marco Rotunno, who monitors migrant arrivals for UNHCR in Sicily.  They mostly point to a lack of security as their reason for leaving. They talk about fighting, kidnappings, ransom and armed robberies.   Conditions in Libya have deteriorated sharply since a 2011 uprising that ousted Muammar Gaddafi.  Gangs frequently kidnap people for ransom, power and water outages are common, health services have been crippled and residents often have to line-up for days to withdraw cash from banks due to a liquidity crisis.  The United Nations is making a new push to end the conflict that has opened the way for Islamist militants and armed smuggling groups who have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe.     In mid-September, fighting erupted in Sabratha, a people smuggling hub on the Western coast, after an armed group clamped down on migrant boat departures, prompting a cross-town rival to retaliate. As of Friday, at least 26 civilians and combatants had been killed and 170 wounded. Islamic State militants conduct attacks in Libya as well, including one on Wednesday that killed at least four people and wounded 39. UNHCR says there are still more than 217,000 internally displaced people in Libya and more than 278,000 who have recently returned home and who are considered people of concern.  Tekbali abandoned his hometown of Kikla, which is located southwest of Tripoli and said it was too dangerous to return. His friend Rafat, who did not give his last name, said he was fleeing Libya after having been kidnapped by a militia in 2016. He was released after nine days when his father paid a ransom of 120,000 dinar ($87,600) but said he feared a repeat. A third man, 24-year-old Alaa, said he was persecuted in Libya because his father had fought in Gaddafi s military. Tekbali said the five friends planned their voyage for a month and set out from a beach between Sabratha and Zuwara after paying 5,000 euros ($5,888) to smugglers for the boat and the small outboard engine.

"DISGUSTING! SEATTLE MAYOR WHO Announced He’s Suing Trump Over Sanctuary City Exec Order Is Accused Of Raping 15-Yr Old Boy, Two Others","Ed Murray has just been accused of alleged sexual assault of teenagers which took place in the 1980 s according to the lawsuit filed. The Mayor denies all allegations.A 46-year-old Kent man sued Seattle Mayor Ed Murray on Thursday, claiming Murray  raped and molested him  over several years, beginning in 1986 when the man was a 15-year-old high-school dropout.The lawsuit in King County Superior Court, filed under the man s initials,  D.H.,  alleges Murray sexually abused the crack-cocaine addicted teen on numerous occasions for payments of $10 to $20. I have been dealing with this for over 30 years,  the man, now sober for a year, said in an interview with The Seattle Times. He said he was coming forward as part of a  healing process  after years of  the shame, the embarrassment, the guilt, the humiliation that I put myself through and that he put me through. A statement from Murray s personal spokesman Jeff Reading said,  These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of vulnerable populations for decades. It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline. These unsubstantiated assertions, dating back three decades, are categorically false. Mayor Murray has never engaged in an inappropriate relationship with any minor.   Mayor Murray will vigorously fight these allegations in court. D.H. is not the first to accuse Murray, one of the state s most powerful politicians, of sexual abuse that occurred decades ago. Murray, 61, has known of other allegations for years, and has quietly, but vigorously denied them.Two men, Jeff Simpson and Lloyd Anderson, said they knew Murray when they were growing up in a Portland center for troubled children, and later as teenagers. They accuse Murray of abusing them in the 1980s when he was in his 20s. Simpson made the claim as a teen in 1984, and talked with a social worker and detective at the time.

Chinese Media Warns of ‘War’ with US Following Tillerson’s Remarks South China Sea," 21st Century Wire says During yesterday s cabinet confirmation hearing in Washington DC, hawkish comments made by President-Elect Trump s Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson were very pleasing to pro-war Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Not so for Chinese war hawks Tillerson s remarks referred to the 3,000 acres of reclaimed land in the South China Sea in the Spratly Island chain, presumably for use by the Chinese Navy, but also as a shipping resource. China denies the new facilities will restrict freedom of movement for any international shipping.It s important to note that there is a tremendous amount of pressure being put to bear on the incoming Trump Administration by neoconservatives and perpetual war advocates like McCain, Graham, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and others. This relentless pressure appeared to affect Tillerson during yesterday s hearings.In response, a Chinese Communist Party publication penned a scathing OpEd in response to Tillerson s comments .Telegraphlocking Chinese access to islands in the South China Sea would require the US to  wage war , an influential Chinese state-run tabloid said on Friday, after US Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson suggested the strategy on Wednesday.

" MI Gov. Dick Sends SEVEN National Guardsman To Help 100,000 Flint Residents","Earlier this week, as public outrage and media attention focused on his failed response to the Flint water disaster, Michigan s republican governor announced that he was calling in the National Guard to help deal with the escalating crisis.On January 13, those troops arrived in the city of 100,000 people. All SEVEN of them. Yes, seven. As in one less than eight.Doing the math, Snyder s response equates to one guardsman per 14,285.7 people.The city of Flint is experiencing a crisis of epic proportions, thanks entirely to the Snyder administration. Water poisoned with lead, and water that is potentially contaminated with the Legionella bacteria (which has already caused 87 serious illnesses and ten deaths) is just one aspect of what is happening in Flint.After the governor and his appointed emergency managers switched the city s water supply to the Flint River, they decided not to bother to treat it with standard corrosion control measures.According to researchers from Virginia Tech University, Flint is the only city in the U.S. that did not have these measures in place.As Marc Edwards of the Virginia Tech water study described to Michigan Radio back in October: What we discovered to our shock was that they switched to a new water source that was obviously very corrosive, meaning it would eat up the lead pipe and iron pipe and essentially put the metals into the water, without controlling the corrosion. And this is a horrible idea in a city full of lead plumbing and lead pipe like Flint. He went on to describe the standard practice for changing a water source. Before you switch to a new water source, six months to a year ahead of time, you are supposed to do laboratory experiments to determine the corrosivity of the water, and the chemistry   the pH, the alkalinity, and the phosphate that you need to make sure that the lead stays on the pipes and out of the water. Edwards explains that Flint s new water system had to have a  corrosion control  plan in place, otherwise the result is that you re  doing an uncontrolled human experiment on a city s population. The decision by Rick Snyder s emergency manager to just skip what was apparently viewed as an  unnecessary  corrosion control expense has basically been just that.  An uncontrolled experiment on a city s population. The amount of damage done to the city s infrastructure is just beginning to be realized.This photo from Flint Water Study researchers Ni Zhu and Siddhartha Roy shows the magnitude of the situtuation.Image credit: Flint Water StudyAccording to a new report released today, researchers believe that the damaged and corroded pipes that are transmitting water throughout the city are likely to become a breeding ground for bacteria, such as the Legionella bacteria which causes Legionaire s disease, along with a host of other potential pathogens.Because of the nature of the Legionella bacteria, which is transmitted through tiny droplets of water in the air, Virginia Tech researchers are recommending that vulnerable populations have minimal contact with the water. That includes people who smoke, the elderly, people with diabetes, people who have recently had surgery and others who might be at greater risk of contracting a waterborne respiratory disease.About 100,000 Flint residents are affected by this unmitigated disaster.In response, Governor Snyder put on a big show of  sending in the National Guard.  Now we know that only SEVEN guardsmen were actually dispatched to the city.After being forced to respond to questions regarding the number of guardsmen he sent to the city, the governor s office proclaimed that there could be as many as 30 or 40 National Guardsmen sent to Flint by the end of the week.During his PR conference on Tuesday, Snyder told the people of Michigan  As we work to ensure that all Flint residents have access to clean and safe drinking water, we are providing them with the direct assistance they need in order to stretch our resources further. The Michigan National Guard is trained and ready to assist the citizens of Flint. He neglected to mention that he was sending SEVEN guardsmen.As reported by Fox 2: The Governor s rhetoric is not doing much to quiet the growing fury in Flint. Gov. Rick Snyder called in the National Guard to assist those helping to get bottled water and filters to the people of Flint. Just seven members of the National Guard showed up to help the nearly 100,000 people in Flint. Watch this video on Governor Snyder s pathetic response to the Flint water disaster, via Fox 2.

"EU defends Iran deal despite Trump, appeals to U.S. Congress","LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday reaffirmed its support for a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers despite sharp criticism of the accord by President Donald Trump, and it urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Trump defied both U.S. allies and adversaries on Friday by refusing to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord, even though international inspectors say it is, and said he might ultimately terminate the agreement. EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg said a failure to uphold an international agreement backed by the U.N. Security Council could have serious consequences for regional peace, and also undermine efforts to check North Korea s nuclear ambitions.  As Europeans together, we are very worried that the decision of the U.S. president could lead us back into military confrontation with Iran,  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters. After a closed-door meeting chaired by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Iran, the ministers issued a joint statement saying the 2015 deal was key to preventing the global spread of nuclear weapons.  The EU is committed to the continued full and effective implementation of all parts of the JCPOA,  it said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the accord with Iran agreed in July 2015 in Vienna.  Trump meanwhile renewed his criticism of the accord, and raised the possibility he might try to end it completely.   We ll see what phase two is. Phase two might be positive, and it might be very negative. It might be a total termination. That s a very real possibility. Some would say that s a great possibility,  the U.S. president said in Washington. He repeated his contention that the JCPOA was  a horrible deal for the United States.  EU foreign ministers said the accord was crucial to opening up Iran s $400-billion economy and finding a new market for European investors. Unlike the United States, the EU saw relations with Iran flourish in the late 1990s until revelations about Tehran s nuclear plans in 2002.   Non-proliferation is a major element of world security and rupturing that would be extremely damaging,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters.  We hope that Congress does not put this accord in jeopardy.   Mogherini said she would travel to Washington early next month to try to muster support for the accord.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says Iran is complying with its commitments under the accord, which Trump has branded  the worst deal ever negotiated . The EU still has sanctions in place against members of Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a major target of Trump s criticism. The EU ministers also discussed on Monday Iran s ballistic missile program, which they want to see dismantled. Tehran says that program is purely defensive. Negotiated after 12 years of talks, the accord with Iran is the most significant diplomatic success for the bloc in several decades.  Many worry that the EU s reputation as an honest broker in a host of future conflicts may not recover if the U.S. Congress reimposes sanctions on Iran and causes the deal - which had the  strong backing of Trump s predecessor Barack Obama - to unravel. Most U.N. and Western sanctions were lifted more than 18 months ago under the deal, though Tehran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo, which is not part of the deal. EU foreign ministers also approved a new batch of economic sanctions on North Korea after its atomic test last month that included an oil embargo and investment ban. But some still hold out hope of repeating the Iran nuclear deal with Pyongyang at some future date. Sweden is one of only seven EU countries with an embassy in Pyongyang and its foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, reiterated that Stockholm could be counted on to help negotiate if asked. But Germany s Gabriel warned that Trump s decision not to certify the Iran accord could scupper such hopes, a position echoed by Mogherini, although she stressed that no such EU mediation was underway.  My concern is that, if we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,  Gabriel said.

"Chinese, Vietnamese Communist parties have 'shared destiny': Beijing","BEIJING (Reuters) - China and Vietnam s Communist parties have a  shared destiny  and there is great potential for bilateral economic cooperation, a senior Beijing official said on Tuesday on a visit to Vietnam, which has clashed with China over the South China Sea. Although both nations are under Communist rule, they are deeply suspicious of each other and relations have been strained over the past few years because of disputes in the strategic South China Sea. China has appeared uneasy at Vietnamese efforts to rally Southeast Asian countries over the busy swathe of sea as well as at its neighbor s growing defense ties with the United States, Japan and India. In July, under pressure from Beijing, Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China. However, Hanoi and Beijing have also tried to prevent tensions from getting out of control, and senior officials from two countries make fairly regular visits to each other. Liu Yunshan, a member of the Chinese Communist Party s elite Standing Committee that runs the country, told Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in Hanoi, in the first such high level visit since relations deteriorated in July, that the two parties  constitute a community of shared destiny with strategic significance , China s official Xinhua news agency reported.  The sound and stable development of the bilateral ties will help to solidify the ruling position of the two parties, which is in the interests of the two parties and people of the two nations,  Xinhua cited Liu as saying.  The two economies are highly complementary, with huge potential for practical cooperation,  the report quoted him as saying. Phuc told Liu that two countries should strive to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea and avoid all activities that could increase tension, the Vietnamese government news website reported. He also urged China to  have substantial discussions soon  with Southeast Asian nations to reach a code of conduct in the disputed sea, the report said. While both the Chinese and Vietnamese reports made no direction mention of the South China Sea by Liu, they quoted him as suggesting the two countries  properly manage and control their divergences, so as to create favorable environment for bilateral cooperation . China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims.

"Trump, Cruz tensions may provide liveliest Republican debate yet","NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Flaring tempers and sharp elbows may turn a debate among seven Republican presidential candidates into a seven-car pileup on Thursday with tensions between Donald Trump and rival Ted Cruz leading the way. The sixth Republican debate, at the North Charleston Coliseum in the swing state of South Carolina, takes place at a tense time for the Republican field with the clock ticking toward Feb. 1 in Iowa, the first contest in the race to choose the party’s nominee for the Nov. 8 general election. The 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT Friday) debate features the top seven candidates ranked by Republican voters: New York real estate businessman and reality TV star Trump, Texas Senator Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Ohio Governor John Kasich.  Nearly every candidate has had a bone to pick with one or more of the others this week. Beyond the Trump-Cruz theatrics, Bush has blasted Trump and Rubio, Rubio has slammed Bush as well as Cruz and Christie, and Christie has attacked most everyone else. “Given all the attacks that are taking place and the counterattacks, I think it will be a more lively debate than we’ve seen at this point,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, who was a top adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. “Donald Trump is still in complete command and the race is still about who will become his main challenger.” In an earlier debate of low-polling candidates, Republicans Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum largely focused their criticism on Democrats rather than each other.  They were all in agreement that President Barack Obama’s strategy toward Iran, the fight against Islamic State and his executive orders last week to strengthen gun control were flawed and should be changed. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who was demoted from the main stage because of faltering poll numbers, dominated the so-called “undercard” debate with a series of one-line zingers, one of them aimed at Democrat Hillary Clinton over her prior marital strains with Bill Clinton, the former president. “Unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband,” said Fiorina. U.S. Senator Paul Rand of Kentucky opted out of the “undercard debate” and said instead he would host a town hall session on Twitter during the main debate. Front-runner Trump has put Cruz, his main obstacle to an Iowa victory, on the defensive by suggesting Cruz may not qualify to be a candidate because he was born in Canada (to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father). This was a change in posture by Trump on the issue, however, after saying in an interview with ABC News last September that he had heard that lawyers believed it was not a problem for Cruz. Trump and Cruz have been friendly over the past year, until now. Being targeted by Trump is a new position for Cruz, who has taken the lead in some polls of Iowa Republican voters in part by avoiding tangles with Trump. In the Reuters rolling national poll on Jan. 12, Trump had 39 percent of the vote, Cruz 14.5 percent, Bush 10.6 percent, Carson 9.6 percent and 6.7 percent favored Rubio, once viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as a rising star. Cruz told reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday that Trump is relying on a judgment on the birthright question from Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, who Cruz described as “a liberal, left-wing, judicial-activist” and a supporter of Democratic Party front-runner Hillary Clinton. “The past couple of elections we saw the Democrats thrilled that they got the nominee they wanted to run against in the general election, and it seems the Hillary folks are very eager to support Donald Trump,” Cruz said. Trump, who has proved to be a master at finding a perceived weakness in an opponent, insisted Cruz’s Canadian birth violated the U.S. Constitution’s requirement that only “natural born citizens” can be president. “Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!” he tweeted on Wednesday. Mudslinging abounds elsewhere in the field as a grouping of other candidates fight to be the alternative to Trump with battles over national security and immigration.

Senate panel approves Obama's pick to lead forces in Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Senate committee approved on Thursday President Barack Obama’s pick to lead U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan.

Nicholson said in testimony to the committee last week that he aimed to review a plan that would cut American troop levels by nearly half by the start of next year, as he acknowledged deteriorating security in the country.

DEMOCRATS FUMING Over Vote To Keep “Hurtful” Word In Library Of Congress,"The left wants to change  hurtful  words to whatever they deem to be ok but they got some push back with the order to keep the word  illegal alien  in the Library of Congress In a victory against political correctness, the House voted to order the Library of Congress to continue referring to  illegal aliens  rather than change the designation to  noncitizen. The party line vote had Democrats fuming, claiming the term was  pejorative  and that liberal doublespeak can never be repealed once it s in use.Well that s not exactly what one Democrat said. Texas Democrat Rep. Joaquin Castro told the House,  The words  illegal alien  will be retired. This will change, whether it s now or six months from now or 10 years from now. For the first time in history, conservatives hijacked a legislative appropriations bill to stop the Library of Congress from abandoning the term  illegal alien  from how it catalogs the 162 million-item collection it manages. Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro attempted to make an amendment to the legislation allowing the Library of Congress to make the change, but it failed to gain traction in the Republican-dominated House. Each year, the Library of Congress makes thousands of changes to its subject headings; in 2015 alone, it added 4,934 new subject headings. Never before has Congress weighed in on the Library of Congress  subject headings in any way, let alone legislated on the issue,  Castro said in a statement.Via: PJ Media",left-news,"Jun 11, 2016",0,1538

 Trump’s Doctor Makes Bizarre Confession (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s doctor didn t follow standard medical procedure when he proclaimed the Republican nominee to be in good health, according to a newly released video. Dr. Harold Bornstein, who has reportedly been Trump s physician for 35 years, confessed that he took only five minutes to write up the assessment of Trump, who he described in the letter as in  excellent  health.The four-paragraph letter   the only medical information released by Trump   was written and released in December but has drawn fresh scrutiny in recent days as Trump s allies have questioned Hillary Clinton s health, despite a more detailed two-page letter from her doctor that said she has no serious issues.In his letter, Bornstein said there were no  significant medical problems  in Trump s history and that a recent examination  showed only positive results. If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,  Bornstein wrote.The letter and Trump s doctor have received renewed scrutiny after the desperate Trump campaign began trafficking in rumor and innuendo about Hillary Clinton s health. Campaign surrogate and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani raised eyebrows when he urged voters to Google search  Clinton illness  to pull up conspiracy theories about the former Secretary of State, and Trump himself has been making remarks about Clinton s  stamina. Despite the Trump campaigns allegations, Clinton s health has been assessed to be good by a real physician citing an actual examination, compared to Trump s doctor.Trump s doctor claims to be board-certified in internal medicine and gastroenterology, but also made comments in his letter attesting to Trump s mental health   how would he have any insight into that?The episode, as with issues of race and religion so far in the election, have shown once again that so many of Trump s attempts to attack Clinton backfire on him due to his odd behavior and the oddity of those he has surrounded himself by.Featured image via YouTube",News,"August 26, 2016",0,2092
Global finance leaders find a more temperate Trump in Washington,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump took power in January pledging to overhaul a global order that he said cheated middle-class Americans with a promise to tear up trade agreements and impose tariffs on China and Mexico. Some of Trump’s policy advisers named allies like Germany and Japan as possible targets for economic retaliation. Fast-forward almost 100 days into Trump’s presidency and the world’s most powerful finance officials, gathered in Washington for the International Monetary Fund spring meetings, have found an administration that is far from the disruptive force Trump promised. Although Trump did act on his campaign promise to tear up a 12-nation Pacific trade pact that had been the cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s Asian pivot, he has taken a much softer stance on other issues. He has refrained from pulling out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, did not carry out a pledge to label China a currency cheat, and his administration has signaled the United States may stay in the Paris climate accord. Constraints being put on Trump by Congress and the courts on issues ranging from healthcare to immigration that would have filtered into the economy and the slow pace with which he is filling key administration jobs have played a role. And some foreign policy makers say they are still not sure who their counterparts are in the Trump administration. But these policy makers said that important initial decisions have been far more centrist than might have been expected. The European Union’s commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, summed up a widely shared sentiment as he highlighted how two people at the top of Trump’s economic team - Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council - have curbed the worst fears over the young U.S. presidency. “We have the feeling that Mnuchin and Cohn are sensible people with whom we can discuss things, who are conscious of what an open economy requires,” Moscovici told Reuters in an interview. The European Union’s view of a more pragmatic administration was shared by Mexico, which attracted some of Trump’s greatest ire. Trump’s threat to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican exports sent the peso currency tumbling, but it has since recovered. Mexico’s finance undersecretary, Vanessa Rubio Marquez, said  discussions with the Trump administration so far have become “anchored” around a handful of issues “that Mexico would be able to deal with.”  “There is still a lot of uncertainty,” she said in a seminar on Wednesday. But “dialogue has been more structured, more constant.” What Trump might mean for the U.S. and world economies has preoccupied central bankers, investors and analysts since the new president took office promising a virtual revolution in the way the United States relates to the rest of the world. Though much about Trump’s policies remain unformed as the administration approaches the 100-day mark, the more extreme risks - such as a trade war or a budget-busting fiscal program that unhinges inflation - seem to have receded. “My belief is that a multilateral framework promoting free trade will continue. There won’t be huge changes to that,” Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters on Thursday. In remarks on Thursday, Mnuchin said tax reform remained a priority as are other steps to boost U.S. growth. But he said the hope for faster growth would mean a stronger world economy, and that it was constructive to coordinate policies through international organizations like the Group of 20. “This administration is willing to reach out and get ideas from the outside,” Mnuchin told top-level bankers at a conference organized in parallel with the IMF meeting. There are still risks. The Trump administration said on Thursday it would embark on a study of whether cheap steel imports from China and other countries were damaging national security. And there are still huge gaps in personnel at key bodies like Treasury and Commerce. “Many of the top jobs are still vacant,” said one European diplomat who was attending the IMF meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity. “Nobody outside the U.S. really knows who is the most powerful or influential one at moment,” the official said.

Trump heads to Japan with North Korea on his mind,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump headed to Japan on the first stop of his five-nation tour of Asia on Saturday, looking to present a united front with the Japanese against North Korea as tensions run high over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile tests. Trump, who is on a 12-day trip, is to speak to U.S. and Japanese forces at Yokota air base shortly after arriving in Japan on Sunday and looked to stress the importance of the alliance to regional security. Ballistic missile tests by North Korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, have exacerbated the most critical international challenge of Trump s presidency. Aerial drills conducted over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have raised tensions in recent days. In a display of golf diplomacy, Trump is to play a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two leaders also played together in Florida earlier this year. Trump will also have a state call with the Imperial Family at Akasaka Palace during his visit. Abe and Trump will meet families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. Joined by his wife Melania on part of the trip, Trump s tour of Asia is the longest by an American president since George H.W. Bush in 1992. Besides Japan, he will visit South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Trump departed Hawaii for Japan aboard Air Force One shortly before 7:27 a.m. Hawaii time (1727 GMT). En route to Hawaii s Hickham Air Force Base, Trump s motorcade stopped briefly at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki.  It has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.  Trump extended the trip by a day on Friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of East Asian nations in Manila. His trip got off to a colorful start in Hawaii. He was taken by boat out to the USS Arizona Memorial, where lies the World War Two ship that was sunk by the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. The Trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.  Trump s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.  We ll be talking about trade,  Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.  We ll be talking about obviously North Korea. We ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we ll see what happens. But I think we re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.  Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, briefing reporters on Friday, defended Trump s colorful language.  What s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they re doing to threaten the world,  McMaster said. Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang. Trade will factor heavily during Trump s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the United States. A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.

SOUTH KOREA Uses Hilarious Technique To TAUNT North Korea After Soldier Escapes Kim Jong Un’s Hell [VIDEO],"There is no word yet, about how Rocket Man plans to respond to the egg on his face South Korea is making sure North Korea doesn t forget about the regime s soldier who defected to the South in a daring escape earlier this month   by blasting updates about the defector s health through its military s loudspeakers at the Demilitarized Zone, a report said on Sunday.South Korean troops broadcasted an update on Sunday about the North Korean soldier s  nutritive conditions,  taking a hit at the Hermit Kingdom s alleged health issues, Yonhap News Agency reported. The broadcasts are reportedly so loud that people within 12.4 miles from the DMZ are able to hear it. The nutritive conditions of the North Korean soldier who recently defected through the Panmunjom were unveiled,  an official told Yonhap News Agency.Consistent updates have been broadcast through South Korean military s loudspeakers since the soldier, identified by his surname, Oh, was shot at least five times while dashing across the Joint Security Area   a strip of land at the DMZ where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face   on Nov. 13. The broadcast operation is part of an ongoing psychological warfare between the North and the South. The gigantic loudspeakers were switched back on in January 2016 after North Korea s fourth nuclear test.The loudspeakers are also reportedly used to blast propaganda to persuade North Korean soldiers to doubt Kim Jong Un s regime and even convince them to defect to the South, the BBC reported. Those speakers have been used sporadically since the end of the Korean War.Watch the North Korean s daring escape here:The 24-year-old North Korean defector is currently recovering from the gunshot wounds he endured when his fellow comrades fired dozens of rounds at him to stop him from defecting to the South. Video of Oh s dash to freedom released on Wednesday showed him speeding down a tree-lined road as stunned North Korean soldiers began running after him. He fell into a pile of leaves against a small wall before being dragged to safety by South Korean troops.   FOX News ",politics,"Nov 26, 2017",0,2204

Lithuania says east-west schism within EU benefits Russia,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Lithuania said a growing rift between some eastern and western European Union states over issues such as migration posed a threat to the bloc at a time of increased Russian military assertiveness. Frictions between ex-communist states in Europe s East and the wealthier West have increased since the 2015 migration crisis and Britain s decision to leave the bloc, as leaders try to quell popular disenchantment with the EU. Nationalist politicians in Poland and Hungary have called for sweeping reform to bring more power back to member states at the expense of Brussels bureaucracy and refused to take part in efforts to relocate migrants from the Middle East.   I believe it s a worry,  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told Reuters on the sidelines of a security conference in Warsaw, when asked about Polish and Hungarian assertiveness within the EU.  We would like to see more cohesion,  he said.  I know who is gaining. Those who are not happy with our cohesion,  Linkevicius said, adding that he was referring to Russia.  We are taking it very seriously not to help those who would like to divide East and West.  Lithuania, alongside Poland, has been particularly worried about Russia since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.  NATO has sought to reassure allies in the region by sending troops to the Baltics, Poland and the Black Sea, setting up a network of NATO outposts, holding more exercises and preparing a rapid response force. Some western officials have expressed concern that parts of the Baltic states, which have large ethnic Russian minorities, could be seized by Moscow, much as Russia took control of Crimea. Linkevicius said good relations with EU powerhouses Germany and France within the EU were crucial because of their ability to help militarily.  Poland, in particular, has seen ties with Paris and Berlin deteriorate since 2015, when the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party took power, over issues such as military procurement, wartime reparations and the EU s single market rules.

BREAKING: Leaked DHS Memo Tells Of Obama’s Plan To Defy Federal Court On Amnesty,"Let s face it, we have a president who s going rogue and defying the rule of law at every turn. This is not your mama s lame duck presidency, but a stealth effort to do everything possible to push the agenda at all costs. The big question is that if Obama continues to defy the rule of law like this, shouldn t Congress finally take action against him? Who ll stand up?   I ve got a pen and I ve got a phone. And I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions    King Obama A newly leaked internal DHS memorandum produced for an off-the-record agency conclave reveals that the Obama administration is actively planning to circumvent a federal court injunction that suspended part of last November s deferral-based amnesty initiative. The document, apparently prepared as follow-up from a DHS  Regulations Retreat  last summer, appears sure to re-ignite concerns in Congress as well as federal judges in the Fifth Circuit. The Administration has already been criticized from the bench for handing out work permits to hundreds of thousands of deferred action beneficiaries, in direct violation of a district court s order. With the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals deciding any day now whether to deny the Administration s request to reverse that injunction, this public leak has come at a critical juncture for U.S. enforcement policy. Last June, four months after Texas federal judge Andrew Hanen s order to freeze President s DAPA and Expanded DACA programs disclosure: the Immigration Reform Law Institute has filed briefs in these cases DHS s immigration policy makers apparently held a  Regulations Retreat  to discuss  different options  for  open market Employment Authorization Document (EAD) regulatory changes.  EAD is the statutory term for work permits. From a memo recording these discussions, we now know that the Obama DHS has, rather than pausing to allow the courts to assess the constitutionality of its enforcement nullification initiatives, been gearing up to roll out one or more of four plans drawn up at the meeting, each one designed to provide EADs to millions of nonimmigrants, including those lawfully present and visa overstayers, crippling the actual employment-based visa system on the federal statute-book.

"Countering Trump, China's Xi touts cooperation in Asia-Pacific","DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific nations must  uphold multilateralism , Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday, countering U.S. President Donald Trump s message at a summit that the United States would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty. Globalization is an irreversible trend, but the world must work to make it more balanced and inclusive, Xi told leaders gathered in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting. His comments came moments after Trump told the same audience the United States would not tolerate chronic trade abuses from partners.  Should we steer economic globalization, or should we dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation or should we go our separate ways?  Xi asked.  Openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind,  he said. During the past year, Xi has positioned China as a defender of globalization in speeches around the world, contrasting himself with Trump, who has pursued his  America First  agenda, and pulled the United States out of the regional Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Trump s predecessor saw the deal as a way for the United States, and not China, to write Asia s trade rules.  Having just concluded a state visit to China, Trump said the United States was ready to make a bilateral deal with any country in the Indo-Pacific region, but only on the basis of  mutual respect and mutual benefit . He blasted the World Trade Organization and multilateral trade deals, and some analysts expect tougher action may be imminent from the White House to fight bilateral trade imbalances with China exacerbated by Beijing s state-led economic model. But Xi s efforts to seize the mantle of free trade have rung hollow to critics of China, who argue it erects more market barriers to foreign companies, using state-driven industrial plans, than any major economy. In Danang, Xi said China would  significantly ease market access  for foreign firms, and all businesses registered in China would be treated as equals. Soon after Trump left Beijing, China said it would raise foreign ownership limits in financial firms, a move cautiously welcomed by business groups as an important step in opening up a tantalizing multi-trillion-dollar financial services market.  The 11 countries still party to the TPP have been looking for a way forward for the deal on the sidelines of the APEC meeting. Japan had lobbied hard to proceed with the pact that could also help to contain China s growing regional dominance, as it is not involved. Xi has been selling an alternate vision for regional trade by promoting the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes Australia, India and more than a dozen other countries, but not the United States. The RCEP is seen as an alternate to the TPP for a path to the broader Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) that APEC aspires to.  We should support the multilateral trading system and practice open regionalism, to allow developing members to benefit more from international trade and investment,  Xi said. China will speed up negotiations with partners on free trade pacts, and work for the speedy conclusion of RCEP talks, he added. ",worldnews,"November 10, 2017 ",1,3369
BAD NEWS FOR THE SPEAKER: Many Republicans Agree…Trump’s Debt Deal Was Better Than Paul Ryan’s,"Trump knows the art of the deal like no one else! He d had enough of do-nothing Paul Ryan so he went around him and made a better deal with Democrats that actually helps the hurricane victims. The three month deal was much better than the commitment of 18 months that Speaker Ryan had proposed: President Trump shocked and angered Republicans on Wednesday by agreeing with Democrats on a bill to suspend the debt ceiling for three months, but by Thursday, Republican lawmakers and aides were acknowledging that Trump s plan was better for Republicans than the plan put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.Many Republicans weren t all that happy with either proposal. Ryan was proposing an 18-month suspension of the debt ceiling that would have let the government keep borrowing as much as it needed, and said the long time frame was needed to provide for market stability.But Democrats said they could only agree to a three-month suspension since they wanted leverage more immediately for other issues they want to pursue in the coming weeks. Trump s decision to take the Democratic plan was seen by some as a betrayal of Republicans, and a sign Trump was abandoning the GOP on a key legislative package.After the dust settled, however, Republican lawmakers and aides made it clear they saw the three-month plan as a slight improvement over Ryan s plan.The reason was simple.Neither plan involved a commitment to new spending cuts as a condition for allowing more government borrowing, something many conservatives wanted to see. With that key piece lacking, many Republicans preferred a shorter term agreement for the same reason Democrats did: it will let them try much sooner to leverage the next debt ceiling fight for their own policy prescription, in this case, spending cuts.A source with the conservative House Freedom Caucus said that group has not met to discuss the plan that Trump settled on Wednesday. But this source said many members of the group seem to agree that both deals were bad because neither included a commitment to spending cuts. Lots of members think the three-month deal is bad, but so is an 18-month deal,  this source said. But the source added that the shorter time frame will at least let them try again soon, and in that way, is better for Republicans. [HFC] members don t want to sit on their hands,  the source said.HFC members, in particular, see the debt ceiling deadline as a chance to threaten not to vote for an increase in the borrowing limit until spending cuts are included. When the battle heats up again, the HFC is expected to push for a cap on federal spending based on a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product.The HFC is a relatively small group of conservative lawmakers known for clashing with House GOP leaders. The Republican Study Committee, in contrast, is more mainstream and is comprised of most House GOP lawmakers for the purpose of advancing conservative policies.But even the RSC indicated Wednesday that Trump s deal is better for Republicans than what Ryan was pushing. For example, RSC member Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Wednesday that he preferred Trump s plan over Ryan s. I think a short-term deal is much easier to vote for than an 18-month or two-year extension with no offsets,  he said on MSNBC, describing the choices that were put before the GOP. Cole cast the deal Trump reached as a slight delay that will let Republicans try again soon for spending cuts. I think a much worse deal would have been to extend the debt ceiling with no spending cuts,  he added.  So we live to fight another day.

Germany probes expenses at Paris embassy; no other embassies affected,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has ordered a  special inspection  into past irregularities in billing of expenses at its embassy in Paris, but the ministry said it was not aware of similar problems at other embassies. Walter Lindner, a senior ministry official, disclosed the probe in a letter to Greens lawmaker Franziska Brantner in letter dated Friday, and said it could trigger new recommendations for billing practices at all foreign offices. The letter marked the first confirmation by the ministry of irregularities at the Paris embassy after French daily Le Monde reported that the embassy had set up an undeclared cash fund to pay staff for special events at the embassy for third parties. In the letter, first reported by the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper, Lindner said the ministry had revamped billing procedures in Paris in spring 2016 after discovering that the previous  form of billing had not met the usual standards.  The changes were triggered after a former butler and head waiter accused the embassy of using fake invoices to channel money into a fund used to give staff undeclared cash for overtime work at events hosted on behalf of private companies such as BMW and Mercedes. Lindner said the changes implemented in Paris ensured  a transparent accounting of the use of the embassy by third parties,  but the thorough review now under way could also trigger recommendations for all foreign missions and embassies. Brantner urged the ministry to hold those accountable for the problematic billing practices in Paris - some of whom still worked for the ministry.   In addition, all foreign offices must be carefully examined to ensure that such practices are not occurring elsewhere,  Brantner said in a statement. She also called for protection of whistleblowers.

 Obama Blasts Trump At Veterans’ Event For ‘Trash-Talking’ Troops (VIDEO),"Most Americans understand that we should all give the utmost honor and respect to those who fight for our safety and our freedom, as well as their families. That is especially true of our Gold Star families   those families who have lost a loved one in battle. Of course, as he has demonstrated on more than one occasion Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not share these values.Trump spent the last 72 hours insulting the parents of a Muslim soldier, Army Captain Humayun Khan, for daring to speak out against his anti-Muslim bigotry. Well, President Obama, on the other hand, spent his Monday afternoon at an event in Atlanta, Georgia for disabled veterans. He also had very harsh words for Donald Trump.Without even mentioning the GOP nominee s name, the President took him to the woodshed over his attacks on the Khans and on the military in general: As Commander-in-Chief, I m pretty tired of some folks trash-talking America s military and troops. You know, our military is somewhat smaller after two major ground wars come to a close. That s natural. We re going to keep doing everything we need to do to improve readiness and modernize our forces. But let s get some facts straight. America s Army is the best trained, best equipped land force on the planet. Our Navy is the largest and most lethal in the world. The precision of and reach of our Air Force is unmatched. Our Marines are the world s truly only expeditionary force. We have the world s finest Coast Guard. WE have the most capable fighting force in  history, and we re going to keep it that way. President Obama is right, of course. How dare Trump or anyone else who has never served or had family members serve trash talk troops and Gold Star families? Trump isn t fit to be Commander-in-Chief.

German war reparations 'matter of honor' for Poland,"KRAKOW, Poland (Reuters) - Demanding reparations from Germany for its actions in Poland during World War Two is a matter of honor for Warsaw, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Polish ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, said on Saturday.  The issue of reparations, revived by Poland s eurosceptic PiS after decades of improving relations with Germany, could escalate tensions between the two European Union members. In September Polish parliamentary legal experts ruled that Warsaw has the right to demand reparations from Germany, although Poland s foreign minister indicated that no immediate claim would be made.  The French were paid, Jews were paid, many other nations were paid for the losses they suffered during World War Two. Poles were not,  Kaczynski said.   It is not only about material funds. It is about our status, our honor ... And this is not theater. This is our demand, a totally serious demand,  added Kaczynski, Poland s de facto leader.  The PiS government, deeply distrustful of Germany, has raised calls for wartime compensation in recent months but Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski has said further analysis was needed before any claims were lodged. Six million Poles, including three million Polish Jews, were killed during the war, and the capital Warsaw was razed to the ground in 1944 after a failed uprising in which 200,000 civilians died.

Trump to top U.S. diplomat: Don't bother talking to North Korea,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday dismissed the prospect of talks with North Korea as a waste of time a day after his own secretary of state said the United States was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful secretary of state, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,  Trump wrote on Twitter, using his sarcastic nickname for Kim and seeming to contradict the top U.S. diplomat. Trump, who has traded insults and threats with Kim in recent weeks amid escalating tensions over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs, later tweeted that his White House predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, had all  failed  on North Korea by  Being nice to Rocket Man.   So why would it work now?  he asked. Kim succeeded his father, Kim Jong Il, as North Korean leader in 2011, during Obama s administration. Previous presidents negotiated with Pyongyang but ultimately failed to prevent it from pressing ahead with its internationally condemned weapons programs. Tillerson disclosed on Saturday that the United States was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programs but that Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue.  Save your energy Rex, we ll do what has to be done!  Trump said. Tillerson said during a trip to China that the United States had multiple direct channels of communication with Pyongyang, the first such disclosure by the Trump administration, and that it was probing North Korea to see if it was interested in dialogue. Tillerson expressed hope for reducing tensions with North Korea, which is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.  We are probing, so stay tuned,  Tillerson told a small group of reporters.  We ask:  Would you like to talk?  He said the United States had  a couple of, three channels, open to Pyongyang.  In Beijing on Monday, China s foreign ministry said it supported dialogue.  We consistently support the United States and North Korea engaging in dialogue and contact to promote mutual understanding and resolve related issues through consultations,  it said in an emailed response to a Reuters query on Tillerson s revelations about contact with North Korea. A senior Trump administration official, asked for clarification about Trump s Sunday morning tweets, played down the significance of the communication channels.  At a time when North Korea is continuing its provocations, the president does not think now is the time to negotiate with them,  the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. To the extent that diplomatic channels exist between Washington and Pyongyang, they are aimed at securing the return of Americans detained by North Korea, the official added. R.C. Hammond, an adviser to Tillerson, denied that his boss had been undercut by Trump s tweets and rejected any suggestion that the secretary of state should resign.  Let s resign the idea of resignation. The President just made it clear to the Kim regime the diplomatic offer on the table is cooling,  Hammond said on Twitter. He also downplayed any contacts.  Channels have been open for months. They ve been unused and cooling for months,  Hammond wrote. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert made a similar point on Sunday.  Diplomatic channels are open for #KimJongUn for now. They won t be open forever,  she wrote on Twitter. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter:  If Tillerson is wasting his time, it s only because his boss fails to understand the catastrophic consequences of war on the Korean peninsula.  Trump s rhetoric on North Korea has run the gamut, from personal attacks on Kim to veiled military threats, from a denial of any interest in talks to an insistence that he would prefer a diplomatic solution. After announcing new U.S. sanctions on North Korea last month, he acknowledged diplomacy was still possible, asking:  Why not? . But he has also frequently declared that he had military options at its disposal, although U.S. officials and outside experts have long said a U.S. strike on North Korea would risk massive casualties.

Hillary Clinton: “Victory Fund” Gets Massive Cash Injection from Hedge Fund Management (Soros),"Wall Street on ParadeAt the Democratic debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on November 14, 2015, Hillary Clinton attempted to portray herself as the fierce enemy of hedge funds. She told the audience the following: You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a Super PAC and they re advertising against me in Iowa as we speak. So they clearly think I m going to do what I say I will do . But two hedge fund billionaires backing a Republican candidate pales in comparison to the tens of millions of dollars flooding into Hillary Clinton s campaign from other hedge fund billionaires   including money flowing into a joint fundraising committee called the  Hillary Victory Fund  that is sluicing money to both Hillary s main candidate committee, Hillary for America, as well as into the Democratic National Committee and 33 separate state Democratic committees, which has some observers crying foul.A recent article at CounterPunch, which questioned the ethics of the arrangement, quotes Paul Blumenthal, campaign finance reporter for the Huffington Post, as follows: It is a highly unusual arraignment if only because presidential candidates do not normally enter into fundraising agreements with their party s committees until after they actually win the nomination. And second, Clinton s fundraising committee is the first since the Supreme Court s 2014 McCutcheon v FEC decision eliminated aggregate contribution limits and congress increased party contribution limits in the 2014 omnibus budget bill. The Democratic National Committee has come under repeated fire for showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton s candidacy versus that of Bernie Sanders. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show that the Hillary Victory Fund has given over $600,000 to the Democratic National Committee and tens of thousands of dollars each to the individual state committees that signed on to the joint fundraising plan.Hedge funds and private equity firms are desperate to hold on to their tax perversion known as  carried interest,  which allows their winnings to be taxed at rates lower than those paid by some plumbers and nurses. In no small part, it s how hedge fund operators ended up as billionaires, effectively subsidized by the wage earner.Federal Election Commission records show that S. Donald Sussman, founder of hedge fund Paloma Partners, gave $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while also donating $2.5 million to Priorities USA, the Super Pac supporting Hillary.Hedge Fund billionaire George Soros donated $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while sluicing a whopping $7 million into Priorities USA to enhance Hillary s efforts to move into the Oval Office.Jay T. Snyder of HBJ Investments, a private equity firm, gave over $300,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund.Dozens of other hedge fund and private equity operators gave lesser amounts to the Hillary Victory Fund. For example, Scott Shleifer of Tiger Global Management kicked in $167,000 while Mark Gallogly of Centerbridge Partners anted up $66,800.Other hedge fund billionaires have skipped the Hillary Victory Fund while writing out stunning amounts to the Super Pac supporting Hillary.On January 11 of this year, James Simons, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who now runs a family office called Euclidean Capital, wrote out a single check for $3.5 million to Priorities USA.According to the latest filing at the FEC, the Hillary Victory Fund joint fundraising committee has raised $26.9 million.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Priorities USA has raised $55.6 million while Hillary s own campaign committee, Hillary for America, has raised $159.9 million.READ MORE US ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",US_News,"April 8, 2016",0,3858

Bridgewater executive McCormick declines Defense Department role,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - David McCormick has declined an offer to be U.S. deputy secretary of defense in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. It had been unclear how seriously McCormick - an Army veteran and former federal official who is now president of the world’s largest hedge fund manager, Bridgewater Associates LP - had been considered for the post. McCormick, who had previously been under consideration to be Treasury Secretary, declined partly because he is happy with his job at Bridgewater and the government role was not the right fit, said the person, who requested anonymity because the information is private.  Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater declined to comment. McCormick did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The news of his withdrawal was first reported by Bloomberg. The Washington Post said the Trump team was considering keeping the current deputy defense secretary, Robert Work, on for at least several months. Retired Marine General James “Mad Dog” Mattis has been nominated to be Trump’s defense secretary, succeeding current Pentagon chief Ash Carter. Before joining Bridgewater, McCormick, a West Point graduate, was both a White House adviser and U.S. Treasury under secretary for international affairs under Republican President George W. Bush.

 Trump Stops Praising Coast Guard’s Harvey Efforts To Viciously Attack The Media (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has now become well known for his completely inappropriate tendency to disrespect those who should be honored. We ve seen it numerous times in Trump s efforts to congratulate and honor members of the military, and we witnessed it again earlier today.On Saturday, Trump visited Houston, Texas to assist a Hurricane Harvey relief effort. While he was there, Trump attacked the media several times   but the most notable one was the incident that happened at the expense of the Coast Guard.In speaking with military officials and first responders who were responsible for saving lives in Texas, Trump couldn t help himself from going after the free press. Trump congratulated the Coast Guard, right before uttering this disgusting attack while pointing directly at the cameras: I hear the Coast Guard saved almost 11,000 people by going into winds the media would not go into. They will not go into those winds unless it s a really good story, in which case they will. For someone who wants the media to be nicer to him and protect his fragile ego, Trump sure doesn t know how to behave himself. The hilarious thing about what Trump just said is that several members of the media did far more to help Harvey victims than Trump did. If he would turn off Fox News for a second and actually pay attention to real news, he would have known that several media figures were helping the Coast Guard and other first responders in their relief efforts. There have even been several documented instances in which reporters directly assisted Harvey victims WHILE they were working. But of course, we can t expect Trump to take the high road   ever.

WIFE OF BRITISH MEDIC Calls Radio Show…Says Husband Processed Migrants With “ISIS Stuff” On Phones…Men Push Women And Children To Back Of Line For Treatment [VIDEO],"A caller to British radio host Katie Hopkins whose name is Jessica, called into Katie s show to relay a story to her about her formerly  bleeding heart liberal  husband who has come to have a  hatred of a certain demographic  after helping migrants who are arriving in migrant rescue boats. Jessica told Hopkins,  My husband is turning into a man I don t recognize anymore because of what he has physically seen. Jessica added that it was the way male migrants behaved in particular, that led to his change of heart.She told Katie:  It was a really, really traumatic time for him. He was doing three-week stints and they were picking bodies out of the sea. Babies, women, it was awful. But at the same time, he said they were processing men, adults, in their 30s who all had phones with Isis stuff on the phones, they were being separated. When they were being handed over to the authorities with the information explaining that these guys had all this on their phones, and what their ages were, and they were just being processed through. There was nothing, they were just being separated out, they just all went through with everything else, it broke his heart, because he was dealing with families who were in such a terrible state with young babies who so clearly needed rescuing. And yet you had adult males that were pushing women and children to the back of the queue they felt that they were more important. It s just an awful situation, and this was last year. He can t handle the way these women and children are treated by these men. There were hundreds and hundreds of women, children, men who were being picked out of the sea. Not all of them were refugees. He came home heartbroken. Absolutely heartbroken, because he s saying  I don t know how Europe is going to cope .She continued:  How are we supposed to process that as individuals? You know, he still has images that he has to deal with over a year later. We forget about the medics who deal with this, the soldiers that are dealing with this. The people that are processing these people. It s not just how are we going to process all these people, but how are we going to deal with the trauma of having to process these people? Having to make these decisions? Who do you treat first?

Because my family think I m a bleeding heart liberal, and you know, I would just wave everyone in and say  come on, we ll help , and my husband was of a very similar opinion that people needed help. He s now turning into someone I don t recognise, because of what he has physically seen. He is starting to say this is not all people looking for help, there are people here who are out for their own self interest. She added:  It s just awful. And now he is building a hatred of a certain demograph[ic], that he has been exposed to because he s seen the way they behave.   LBCIs it too late for Europe? Have they allowed this unabated invasion of migrants from majority Muslim nations to their once  culturally distinct nations for too long? What will these bleeding heart nations look like in 5 years? How long will Americans sit back and allow bleeding heart liberals to call them  racists  or  xenophobes  because they don t want to see the fundamental transformation of the United States that Barack Obama promised would happen if we elected him as our president.

After the undercover video was released that exposed the Democrats plan to incite violence against innocent Trump supporters, the media was silent. The media was also silent when it was discovered that Obama s Attorney General Eric Holder, used taxpayer funds to pay people to protest against George Zimmerman in the heated Trayvon Martin case, which was the birthplace of the violent Black Lives Matter movement. Those protests marked the first step in Obama s plan to divide America.In a statement on Twitter, CNN recalled comments from White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders last week that the president doesn t condone violence against the media.

 Maine’s Tea Party Governor Just Went On A Racist Rant So Offensive It Could Get Him Impeached,"Worst governor in the United States Paul LePage (R-Of Course) has said and done some truly reprehensible things during his time in office, but the latest bit of toxic sludge spewed from his mouth might finally be his downfall.On Wednesday night, during a town hall meeting, Maine s governor went so deeply racist that even members of his own party acknowledged it was  one of the most offensive statements  ever to come out of LePage s mouth   and that s saying something.While discussing Maine s drug problem, LePage floated the idea that it was out of state black people who were getting (white) Mainers hooked on heroin. It got worse from there. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty   these types of guys   they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home,  LePage told a large crowd.  Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty In a shameless attempt to spin it as not overtly racist, LePage s long-suffering communication director, Peter Steele, said that this wasn t about race. He then gave the following word salad defense. The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. There are, might I say, just a few questions left unanswered here. Why did he use names like  D-Money  to refer to the  types of guys  who come into the state from Connecticut and New York? Doesn t that sound a lot like the kind of  gangsta  name a white conservative from Maine might come up with if they were brainstorming the backstory of a black drug dealer? Why did he specifically mention  young, white girls  when describing the kind of girls D-Money  likes to  impregnate?  Does he have any proof that  half the time  out of state drug dealers of any race impregnate Maine s young women?But the biggest question is Does he really think the entire state of Maine is too stupid to notice this for what it is? An ugly racist rant that is meant to stoke old racial fears of black men stealing white women?Democrats have long complained about LePage, but even Republicans are finding it increasingly hard to ignore his egregious behavior. Some have even created a website called  Get Right Maine,  which is an attempt to get LePage booted out of office and give the Republican Party a chance to save their image from the damage LePage has done.For LePage, his racist rant couldn t come at a more vulnerable time politically. Just days before he decided to introduce his imaginary black stereotype D-Money to voters, Maine s state lawmakers were discussing whether they should kick LePage from office or just censure him.House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said LePage created this situation with his own actions. We join other Mainers around the state and share their anger and frustration,  said McCabe.  Democrats are focused on the most pressing issues before us. We are committed to addressing the drug crisis, growing access to broadband as well as helping our struggling mills.   The governor has isolated himself and we are not playing his games. He just handed his haters   which is, roughly, just about everyone he works with   a ton of ammunition. Ever his own worst enemy, LePage countered by throwing a massive tantrum, accusing his own party of conspiring against him and vowed to never work with Democrats again.The sooner LePage gets booted from office, the better.Feature image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016",0,3965

Advocates for Americans held in Iran worried by Trump's hard line,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Advocates for Americans imprisoned by Iranian authorities said on Friday they were concerned the Trump administration s hard line on Iran would close off the chance for talks to secure the prisoners  release. In a major shift in U.S. policy, President Donald Trump announced he would not certify that Iran is complying with a 2015 nuclear deal and warned that he might ultimately terminate the agreement. The administration also designated Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the dominant player in the country s security, economy and politics, as a terrorist group, a move one expert said would make the group less willing to negotiate over the prisoners. Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who was detained by Iran for 18 months, said on Twitter that Trump s Iran strategy  will only hurt American hostages being held in Iran.   I hope I m wrong, but it looks to me as though Americans being held hostage in #Iran were just abandoned by @realDonaldTrump,  Rezaian wrote, using Trump s Twitter handle. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. A State Department official said the United States calls for the  immediate release  of U.S. citizens held  unjustly  in Iran. The seven known American citizens and permanent residents who have been detained in the last two years in Iran are businessman Siamak Namazi and his 81-year-old father Baquer Namazi; Princeton doctoral student Xiyue Wang; art gallery owner Karan Vafadari and his wife Afarin Niasari; Robin Reza Shahini, an Iranian-American from California; and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese national with U.S. permanent residency.  My biggest frustration is still the U.S. government has no plan for how to resolve this, and my husband has been in prison for 15 months,  Wang s wife, Hua Qu, told Reuters.  She said the new U.S. sanctions made her  afraid  for her husband s fate, because they show  that the relationship is deteriorating.      Wang was arrested in August 2016 while doing dissertation research and has been sentenced to 10 years in prison on espionage charges, allegations his family and university deny.  I don t know when the U.S. government is going to engage Iran,  Qu said.  He is living in this terror everyday. He is in despair.  Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said on a conference call with reporters that designating the IRGC as a terrorist group would  make it far more difficult to have a direct line of communication with them.   The IRGC is going to be in much less of a mood to engage in a serious negotiation with the United States after this,  said Sadjadpour, a friend of Namazi. In January 2016, the Obama administration secured the release of five Americans imprisoned in Iran by agreeing to a much-criticized prisoner swap after protracted direct talks with Iran. In the months following the swap, the Iranian government arrested several more Americans. The IRGC is typically the entity that has detained and interrogated the Americans, according to their family members and human rights groups. Jason Poblete, a U.S.-based attorney for Zakka, said the sanctions could be helpful  if it gets these parties talking to each other.  He criticized the Obama administration s approach to Iran as not being focused enough on  the unconditional release of hostages.   Anything that moves us to speaking clearly with one another, which is what the president s doing, is much better than all this flimsy talk that had been taking place until now,  Poblete said.

Tillerson will not meet Turkey opposition in Ankara visit this week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will not meet members of Turkish opposition groups during a one-day visit to Ankara this week where talks with President Tayyip Erdogan will focus on the war in Syria, senior U.S. officials said on Monday. Thursday’s visit comes at a politically sensitive time in Turkey as the country prepares for a referendum on April 16 that proposes to change the constitution to give Erdogan new powers. A senior State Department official said Tillerson will meet with Erdogan and government ministers involved in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. “It is certainly something we are very acutely aware of and the secretary will be mindful of while he is there,” one State Department official told a conference call with reporters, referring to political sensitivities ahead of the referendum.  American officials expect Erdogan and others to raise the case of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government accuses of orchestrating a failed coup last July. The focus of the Ankara talks is the U.S.-led offensive to retake Raqqa from Islamic State and to stabilize areas in which militants have been forced out, allowing refugees to return home, officials said. A major sticking point between the United States and Turkey is U.S. backing for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey considers part of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that has been fighting an insurgency for three decades in Turkey. But the United States has long viewed Kurdish fighters as key to retaking Raqqa alongside Arab fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). “We are very mindful of Turkey’s concerns and it is something that will continue to be a topic of conversation,” a second U.S. official said. Turkey, Russia and Iran have held Syrian peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on a ceasefire in Syria. The United States has proposed “areas of stability” where Islamic State has been pushed out and refugees can be returned. Six years since the start of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, he is winning on the battlefield although the war is far from over.

Mexico says does not expect Trump deportation plan to begin soon,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Deportations of undocumented Mexican migrants in the United States may start rising when President-elect Donald Trump takes office but the process will not begin soon, Mexico’s deputy interior minister for migration said on Wednesday. Trump surged to victory early on Wednesday morning after upsetting pollsters’ predictions to beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and seize the White House in a campaign that sent the world into uncertainty. The impact of his win was particularly acute in Mexico, where the beleaguered peso currency fell about 10 percent in the aftermath of the vote. Trump, who will be inaugurated Jan. 20, has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, fence off Mexico with a border wall and threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, putting in danger billions of dollars in cross-border trade. “It may well be that deportations of the estimated 6 million undocumented Mexicans increase but we don’t think it will be a measure that will take place soon or happen quickly,” Humberto Roque Villanueva, the deputy interior minister for migration, told Reuters in an interview. “The Mexicans over there are useful to the North American economy and President Trump, the president-elect, will need to recognize the economic effects of such a campaign promise,” he said. Roque Villanueva also said Mexico stands ready to lobby the U.S. Congress and use all legal means possible to block Trump’s plan for impounding remittances so that Mexico ends up paying for his proposed wall on the southern U.S. border. “They wouldn’t be retaliatory measures. They would be legal responses,” he said. “We’ll be ready for all the craziness.” ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1,1763
"Brexit with no deal risks chaos in drug supply, report warns","LONDON (Reuters) - Crashing out of the European Union without a deal would cause major problems for Britain s health service and risk  chaotic disruption  to medicine supplies, according to a report on Tuesday. The Nuffield Trust, an independent health charity, also warned that Brexit without a deal on future relations with the EU would lead to worsening staff shortages in the National Health Service (NHS). And it could create particular problems for healthcare in Northern Ireland, where treatment programs for some rare and serious diseases are designed to work across the entire island of Ireland.  A scenario where the UK leaves without any deal would cause extensive problems for the NHS. It would risk a chaotic disruption to supplies of medical products, and a rise in prices that would push hospitals deeper into deficit,  the report stated.  Many different parts of EU law and EU institutions play an important role in enabling care to be delivered to the standards we see today. Suddenly ending them with no replacement would do serious damage to an already strained British NHS.      The warning chimes with concerns from pharmaceutical companies, which are already drawing up plans to protect supply chains. Stringent medicine regulations mean manufacturers face multiple Brexit uncertainties, such as the potential need to retest drugs shipped across borders and transfer product licences to different jurisdictions.

Republicans worry Trump scandals may doom legislative agenda,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scandals enveloping U.S. President Donald Trump have left Republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly gloomy about the prospects for passing sweeping tax cuts, a rollback of Obamacare  and an ambitious infrastructure program. With the White House and both chambers of the U.S. Congress under Republican control, party leaders and their allies in the business community had expected to get quick traction on their plans, with corporate tax cuts among the top priorities. But four months into Trump’s tenure, only limited progress has been made. The House of Representatives passed a measure to rewrite Obamacare, but the Senate is only in the very early stages of considering the issue. Lawmakers are just beginning their push on tax reform. In addition to congressional probes that are taking place into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign team and Russia, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday named former FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate the matter. “It’s the elephant in the room right now,” said Republican Representative Pat Tiberi. “The smartest minds in the White House know that, whether it’s tax reform or anything else on the public policy front. It’s hard enough to get things done in the U.S. Capitol under the best of circumstances.” The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on tax reform on Thursday. Key administration and congressional leaders met Wednesday afternoon to discuss a path forward. But they remain a long way from signing a bill into law. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that “less drama from the White House” was needed to advance legislative priorities.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Wednesday that the legislative process had “pretty much ground to a halt” amid the tumult in Washington. Republican Representative Steve Womack said it was important for committees investigating the Russia matter to move forward expeditiously to both ensure that the public gets answers and to clear the way for Congress to move on to other issues. “Any time we get bogged down on these kinds of issues unrelated to the governing agenda, it serves to delay and to sometimes complicate the real job that we have to do for the American people,” Womack said. At a news conference on Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan urged his colleagues to “seize this moment” to pass tax reform. But instead of discussing tax rates and structures, Ryan was faced with a series of questions about James Comey, who Trump fired as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week, and the Russia investigation. Several lobbyists said that in the past week their corporate clients have grown more cautious on the prospects for tax reform but still hope that at least a small package can be approved.  “My worry level has grown considerably,” one lobbyist said. Some lobbyists suggested that Congress could consider focusing on tax breaks and perhaps leave aside the comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that they had originally hoped for.  “When this all started, the thing we heard from the Hill was ‘transformative tax reform,’” said a strategist who consults with major companies focused on tax reform. “I think as time passes, tax reform is going to look much different, that it may be begin to look more like tax cuts than tax reform.”  ",politicsNews,"May 18, 2017 ",1,3421
 Trevor Noah Tears Ben Carson Apart For Attacking President Obama (VIDEO),"It s hard to believe that Ben Carson is a brain surgeon after the words that have come out of his mouth during his run for the Republican nomination for the presidency. Yet again, it s hard to believe the guy s running for the presidency at all. In a continuous series of stupid comments, Ben Carson has once again outdone himself. During an interview, Ben Carson claimed that President Obama was  raised white  and thus can t identify with the  experience of black America.  But, Trevor Noah of The Daily Show isn t letting him off so easily. During a segment of his show, Noah said: Like a glitched character on a video game, Ben Carson is just off facing the wrong direction. Yeah, he is not attacking Trump or the other Republicans, but rather he s chosen to attack President Obama. And it s not for his policies and it s not for his record. It s for not being black enough. So Ben Carson is saying that because Obama didn t grow up poor, he didn t grow up black. That is such a bullshit argument. Being poor isn t what makes you black. Because if it is, then there are a lot of people living in trailers in the middle of America who will be very upset to hear the news.  I m what??  But they re not black. And we know this. Because if they were, their trailers would have nicer rims. Although the segment is hilarious, Noah makes a brilliant point: Why not attack the president for his policies instead of some nonsensical measure of how black the president is or isn t?  Focusing on the issues will go a long way in lending some credibility to Ben Carson s campaign. Thus, it s no wonder that his campaign is foundering.The type of cheap talk Carson has brought to the table is similar to that of the rest of the Republican clowns running for the nomination. We shouldn t expect better.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture.",News,"February 25, 2016",0,1927

 GOP Candidate Loves Trump Because He ‘Puts Self-Righteous F*ggots In Their Place’,"Donald Trump is the Twitter candidate, so it shouldn t be a surprise that one of his supporters got himself into hot water with a recent tweet. That supporter is a candidate for Massachusetts state Senate and in it, he praised Trump for  putting self-righteous faggots in their place. Ted Busiek, who wants to eliminate affordable housing, same-sex adoptions and daylight savings time, denied that this tweet was hateful:DONALD TRUMP. Putting self-righteous faggots in their place since 1993. How I love this fellow.#MAGA https://t.co/wqCxfa4pI2  Ted Busiek (@TedBusiek) July 2, 2016Instead, he insisted, it was a reference to the way Trump, in 1993, insulted Native Americans: If you look at some of the reservations that you ve approved . . . they don t look like Indians to me. And they don t look like Indians to Indians. And a lot of people are laughing at it,  Trump said in the remarks dated 1993, apparently shocking the congressman questioning him, who likened the remarks to historical racism. Trump said,  Only Indians can have the gaming . . . Why are you being discriminatory? Why is it that the Indians don t pay tax, but everybody else does. I do. Busiek told the News Service he didn t intend the term in a  hateful sense  or to imply that the congressman was gay, using the word instead to mean the congressman was  obnoxious  and was  kind of being a jerk. Source: Mass LiveGot it, so it was the  nice  use of the word  faggot.  Of course, Busiek s history might indicate otherwise. I already mentioned that he s against same-sex adoptions, and of course, he s against same-sex marriage. He, like many Trump supporters, is also concerned about losing his rank as a white man on the (excuse the pun) totem pole.Claiming a  cultural rift  exists between State House politicians and a sizable section of the Bay State s population, Busiek told the News Service he spoke for  anybody who works for a living,  and those who find themselves  under attack  for their  oppressor status  as white, male and successful. I think there s a great amount of jealousy involved,  Busiek said of so-called  social justice warriors,  who attack real and perceived racial and gender sleights.Asked if he was a social justice warrior for successful white men, Busiek said,  That s a good way to sort of turn it on its head. Maybe I m engaging in identity politics, too,  Busiek said, though he said he disagrees with that point of view because, he said, identity politics is contingent on being  born into a victim class. If Busiek s tweet proves anything, it s that Trump is merely a mirror reflecting the bigotry of his supporters. Trump is a truly horrible human being, who insults women and basically every minority, but he says very little about LGBT people. If anything, he s been historically supportive. Of course, that s not to say Trump won t tweet something ugly about gay people today. After all, he s all about pleasing his supporters.Featured image via Ted Busiek s Facebook page.",News,"July 5, 2016",0,3074

IT ONLY TOOK ONE TWEET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP For Billionaires To Open Up Their Wallets For This “FIGHTER!”,"A week after President Trump endorsed Ron DeSantis for Florida governor via Twitter, a handful of billionaires have thrown their support behind the three-term Republican congressman, per Politico.Here s President Trump s tweet endorsing Rep. Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.  Trump tweeted:  Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER! Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2017Why it matters: The monetary support DeSantis has received could prove instrumental in his race, because, in a  state as big as Florida, where a week s worth of saturation TV during next year s general election could cost as much as $3 million, cash is king,  per Politico.Supporters include casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, hedge fund heiress Rebekah Mercer, investment tycoon Foster Friess, as well as other donors who have funded Trump s 2016 campaign and the conservative Koch brothers  network, per Politico.  AxiosRepresentative Ron DeSantis (R-FL) is a fighter. Here s an example of how DeSantis took on the fake Trump-Russian collusion story:Sun Sentinel   DeSantis, who hasn t officially announced his candidacy, thanked Trump in a press release with the headline,  President Trump Backs Ron DeSantis for Governor of Florida. I m grateful to have the president s support and appreciate what he has done,  DeSantis said, adding praise for Trump achievements that have pleased conservatives: recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, signing the tax reform legislation, and appointing conservative judges.DeSantis, a Republican from Ponte Vedra Beach, has been a strong supporter of Trump.In August, he proposed cutting off funding for special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.DeSantis  proposal, which went nowhere, would have stopped money for the investigation 180 days after it becomes law. And it would have prevented Mueller from investigating  matters  that occurred before Trump announced his presidential campaign.Also in August, DeSantis used an appearance at the Palm Beach County Republican Party s annual lobsterfest to advertise his pro-Trump credentials.As he delivered a combination political speech and invocation, the big screens at the front of the room flashed a picture of DeSantis, his wife, their infant daughter, the president and First Lady Melania Trump outside the White House.DeSantis said the president complimented his wife on her appearance.At that Palm Beach County appearance, and at events throughout the state, DeSantis has been laying the groundwork for a 2018 candidacy for the Republican nomination to run for governor.Here s Ron DeSantis blasting the press and our government agencies for giving Barack Obama a free pass over his support for Hezbollah:The Trump effect: DeSantis reflects the shifting type of Republican candidate under Trump: he s a Fox News contributor, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a supporter of Trump s recent decision to make Jerusalem the home of the U.S. embassy in Israel, and he opposes Special Counsel Bob Mueller s Russia probe (even calling for it to end after just six months).",politics,"Dec 29, 2017",0,3584
Watchdog says Gulf rift taking toll on ordinary citizens,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Families are being torn apart by the rift between Qatar and three other Gulf Arab states which began six months ago, Amnesty International said on Thursday, despite measures to ease the impact of the crisis on ordinary citizens. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, along with Egypt, imposed travel, economic and diplomatic sanctions on Qatar in June over allegations of supporting terrorism. Doha denies the charge. The human rights group, citing interviews with individuals and Qatari officials, said thousands of people had been  affected by the rift, which has split families, raised food prices for foreign workers and made visits to Islamic holy sites in Saudi Arabia more difficult. Officials from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain could not immediately be reached to comment on the report. But the three U.S.-allied countries had announced measures in June to ease the impact of the dispute on mixed families, including setting up hotlines to deal with humanitarian issues. Saudi Arabia has also said it was allowing visits to holy sites and opened its doors to Muslims in Qatar to perform the annual Muslim haj pilgrimage.   Diplomatic efforts led by Kuwait to resolve the dispute have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough. The report was based on interviews with 44 affected individuals conducted in late November in Qatar as well as meetings with Qatari officials. Despite measures to allow families in mixed marriages to visit, many were finding it difficult to comply with procedures required to apply for a  laissez-passer  that allows residents of Qatar to travel to see loves ones in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain or the UAE, the report said. It said that there was scant, or no, information about the application process on official UAE and Saudi ministry websites, while travel to Bahrain had become more difficult since Manama imposed an entry visa requirement for Qatari nationals and residents at a time when the embassy in Doha is closed.  Affected families told Amnesty International that hotlines announced by the Bahrain, Saudi Arabian and UAE governments were difficult to access,  the rights watchdog said. Lynn Maalouf, Director of Research for the Middle East at Amnesty International, said that by imposing travel restrictions on ordinary people, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have  violated the right to family life, education and freedom of expression .  Since this dispute began in June, our fears about its potential to rip families apart have been cruelly and emphatically realized,  Maalouf said in a statement.

And if a prosecutor doesn t ask, a grand jury won t indict. The US government at the times when Hillary Clinton was in charge of the foreign policy did use Libya as a conduit to get arms to jihadists in Syria. That is well-established not just by a range of raw materials but also by   investigative reporters in the US, some of which were even published in The New York Times. La Farge, which is   giant transnational concrete company was involved in Syria. There are more than 350 La Farge related emails in our Syria emails release.

"Trump says 'nothing funny' about 'Saturday Night Live,' but audience soars","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his scorn for satirical TV show “Saturday Night Live,” whose popularity has soared since Alec Baldwin began impersonating him in the final weeks leading up to the election. Trump, a guest host on “Saturday Night Live” in November 2015 when he was running for the Republican presidential nomination, has vented his anger on Twitter in recent weeks, calling the NBC show “totally unwatchable” and a “hit-job.” In an interview on NBC’s “Today” show on Wednesday, Trump was asked whether he had considered no longer watching it, given his complaints. “I hosted ‘SNL’ when it was a good show, but it’s not a good show anymore,” Trump responded. “First of all, nothing to do with me, there’s nothing funny about it. The skits are terrible.” The show’s audience has jumped 33 percent since Baldwin began impersonating Trump in October, according to NBC. The network said some 11.4 million people on average are watching the program this season, starting Oct. 1, making it the most-watched season since 1992. Trump on Wednesday attempted to cast doubt on the future of “Saturday Night Live,” which has lampooned presidents and politicians from both parties since it first aired 41 years ago.  “Frankly, the way the show is going now, if you look at the kind of work they’re doing, who knows how long that show’s going to be on. It’s a terrible show,” Trump said. The Republican businessman and former star of NBC’s reality TV show “The Apprentice” also said Baldwin’s depiction of him was “really mean-spirited and not very good.” “I do like him and I like him as an actor, but I don’t think his imitation of me gets me at all,” Trump added. Baldwin, who has portrayed Trump as unprepared for office or tweeting during security briefings, tweeted back to Trump last week, “Release your tax returns and I’ll stop. Ha.”  Trump broke with decades of tradition followed by both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates by refusing to release his tax returns. Baldwin, 58, the former star of NBC’s comedy “30 Rock,” told celebrity magazine Hola! in an interview, that he was glad other people found his impressions funny after a divisive election. “There are bad feelings on both sides, so to have the opportunity to give people a chance to talk and laugh about it is a good thing,” Baldwin told the U.S. edition of the magazine in an interview released on Tuesday.

WHY DID HARRY REID LIE ABOUT THE “ACCIDENT” He Had That Left Him Blind In One Eye?,"Dirty Harry must ve jarred something in his head that makes him unaware that he s lying in public. He used to be pretty good at hiding it Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is changing the story about how he sustained those gruesome New Year s Day injuries that have left him blind in one eye.Previously, Reid claimed that an exercise band he was using  broke. I was doing exercises that I ve been doing for many years with those large rubber bands and one of them broke and spun me around and I crashed into these cabinets and injured my eye,  (emphasis added) Reid said at a press conference on January 22.(You can see the video of that press conference here.)But now, in an interview conducted by Fusion (a joint venture between ABC and Univision), excerpts of which have been released today, Reid tells Univision anchor Jorge Ramos that the exercise band  slipped,  rather than  broke. [T]he [elastic band] strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet,  Reid tells Ramos.Reid s latest version of the incident, as told to Ramos, differs from previous versions advanced by his team in another very significant way. Sources familiar with the incident said Reid was exercising in his bathroom, with the exercise band attached to the shower door,  Politico reported on January 22. (emphasis added)As Breitbart News reported previously, that version of the story, almost certainly told to Politico by Reid s staffers with his approval, is not credible.Now, however, Reid tells Ramos a different story. The exercise band was not attached to the shower door in his bathroom, Reid says, but was instead attached to  a big metal hook that came out from the wall  in an unspecified room in his new Nevada home.Here s a partial transcript of the excerpt of the interview released by Fusion:Ramos: You said recently that the accident had nothing to do with your decision to retire.However, we are seeing the consequences of what happened.What really happened?Was it really with an elastic band?Reid: Yeah, I had a big, that thick (Reid gestures with his hands), that I had been using for about four years and I was, you know, trying to maintain my, uh, firmness, and, uh, that was my weight training. I was doing that in my new home here in Nevada and a big metal hook that came out from the wall that was hooked there that the strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard that uh Ramos: It looked like somebody had hit you.Reid: I am so fortunate that, um, it wasn t over just a fraction of this way and hit me in the temple.Ramos: How s your eye?Reid: I am sightless in my right eye.Watch the full video of the excerpts of the Fusion interview here:Ramos then switched gears and asked Reid about  the most difficult moments of [his] 28 years in the Senate. Ramos failed to ask some key follow up questions about Reid s New Year s Day injury incident.For instance, Ramos failed to ask Reid if the accident took place in his bathroom, as Reid s office had previously claimed. According to Reid s latest version of the story, we do not know in which room of his house he now claims he sustained these injuries.Breitbart News has asked Senator Reid s office, which has carefully controlled the release of information about his New Year s Day injuries, to comment on his changed version of the story of his New Year s Day injuries, but has received no reply.Via: Breitbart News",Government News,"Apr 9, 2015",0,3755
Two Trump kids won't be voting for Dad in New York primary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump says two of his children feel guilty about missing a voter registration deadline, meaning they will not be able to vote for him next week in New York’s Republican primary. Eric Trump, 32, and Ivanka Trump, 34, the Republican front-runner’s second and third children, have campaigned extensively with their father, but both missed the deadline for registering as Republicans to vote in the New York primary on April 19. In a telephone interview with “Fox & Friends,” Trump joked that he would have to find some way to punish Eric and Ivanka for their mistake. “No more allowance!” the New York billionaire said with a laugh. For already registered voters, any request to switch party affiliation must have been made by early October. The deadline for new voter registrations was March 25. “They were unaware of the rules,” Trump said Monday on Fox News. “They feel very, very guilty. “But it’s fine. I mean, I understand that.” Records from the New York State Board of Elections show both Eric and Ivanka are registered voters who are “not enrolled in a party,” ABC News reported. Like their father, they have made political contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, Federal Election Commission records show. Trump’s oldest child, Donald Jr., 38, already was registered Republican. The registration status of his other voting-age child, Tiffany, was not immediately known. Trump’s comments on Monday brought swift rebukes on Twitter from critics who said the Trump children’s lapse bolsters doubts about whether Trump is a true Republican. Trump previously supported abortion rights and has donated to Democrats, including his now-rival Hillary Clinton. “I for one am shocked as the whole family really seem like lifelong conservatives,” user Awen Lake (@AwenLake) posted on Twitter, adding the hashtag #reallydemocrat. “This is so funny. I always knew he was a liberal,” a user named Allen (@alb309O) wrote. “He has his supporters bamboozled.” ",politicsNews,"April 11, 2016 ",1,2068

France's Macron says will continue to press Trump on climate agreement,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday he had not given up on trying to get U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to change his mind about withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate change agreement. The final statement from the Group of 20 leaders meeting in Hamburg on Saturday exposed the divide that remains between the United States and other G20 members on the 2015 Paris accord aimed at combating climate change. But Macron also said he would host a summit on Dec. 12 to move the Paris deal forward. “On Dec. 12, two years after the Paris (climate) agreement, I will therefore convene a summit to take further action on climate, notably on the financial front,” Macron told reporters. He said that the summit would aim to mobilize private and public financing for the projects committed to under the Paris agreement. Asked if he was trying to persuade Trump to change his mind on the climate deal, Macro said: “I never despair to convince, because I think it is a duty, given my position, and it is a trait of my character”. Macron and Trump met during the G20 summit in Hamburg and Trump will travel to France for the Bastille Day military parade on July 14. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2017 ",1,1270
 The Bundy Militia Now Has An ISIS Supporter Handling Their Computer Work (VIDEO),"David Fry is a self-titled  computer expert  that has joined the Bundy occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. He is also a huge fan of Adolf Hitler and supports ISIS.A post that Fry made to his Google+ account read as follows: ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS FOR ISIS TO NUKE ISRAELHELL! Source: opb.orgWhen asked by OPB to explain why he supported ISIS and liked Hitler, he spoke about government conspiracies, plots against other nations, the September 11th attacks, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the world with nuclear meltdowns.One week before Fukushima happened, an Israeli security team installing security equipment was there at Fukushima.Source: opb.orgFry explained that he drove from Ohio to join the occupation because he felt the Bundy militia consisted of  pretty good people.

 Ammon Bundy Just Got Sweet Justice Handed To Him By A Federal Judge (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy and his armed ganged of militants have upset an entire nation over the last couple of weeks for their supposed special treatment by the police. While that did appear to be the case for the longest time, the raid was partially broken up by authorities after a shootout with one of Bundy s pals, LaVoy Finicum. Now, a federal court is refusing to give people that same impression   and they re sending the message loud and clear: There will be NO special treatment after laws have been broken, no matter who you think you are.On Friday, U.S. District Court judge Stacie Beckerman told Ammon Bundy and his brother that they would remain in jail and not be let out on bail pending their trial on federal conspiracy charges.If anyone knows anything about the court system, it s not a quick process. That means Ammon Bundy is going to be in jail for a long time. That should give him quite a long time to think about what he s done, and it should also discourage other so-called armed militants calling themselves  Federalists  out to protect peoples  rights from thinking they can get away with breaking the law, too.Pic via Twitter.The reason for the denial should come as no surprise, though: there are still four militants occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. If the judge released Bundy or any of the other perpetrators already arrested, they could simply return to the building. And   that s exactly what prosecutors communicated to the court before bail was denied. They also hilariously used the Bundys own words against them: This creates an inherent risk of flight. Moreover, [their] own statements demonstrate his unwillingness to comply with the terms of pretrial supervision.On August 16, 2015, Bundy posted on Facebook that  There is no justice in a federal court.

 Trump Official ADMITS He Is Collecting ‘Dossiers’ To Blackmail Journalists Into Submission,"Reality TV star Omarosa Manigault has found herself a pretty sweet position in the Trump administration as the director of communications for the Office of Public Liason   but like all of Trump s team, she is learning that the old adage involving loose lips and sinking vessels (like the Trump administration) applies to her current role.With General Flynn s resignation over his suspicious conversation about sanctions with one of Vladimir Putin s lackeys and all the other disasters Trump has caused, whined about, and made worse through his attempts to clean up his mess, the last thing he needs is one of his people revealing that his administration is collecting information they intend to use to blackmail the press but enter Omarosa.American Urban Radio Networks  White House correspondent April Ryan says that last Wendesday Omarosa threatened her outside the West Wing both physically and otherwise:Manigault, who is now a communications official in the Trump administration, got into a heated argument with a White House reporter just steps from the Oval Office last week, according to witnesses. The reporter, April Ryan, said Manigault  physically intimidated  her in a manner that could have warranted intervention by the Secret Service.Ryan also said Manigault made verbal threats, including the assertion that Ryan was among several journalists on whom Trump officials had collected  dossiers  of negative information.Manigault, a onetime friend of Ryan s, declined to address Ryan s accusations on the record, offering only this emailed statement:  My comment: Fake news!  She did not specify what she considered false.As we have learned by now, when the Trump administration cries  fake news,  the allegations are generally true. Despite Manigault s denials, multiple witnesses confirm that the altercation did take place, with one remarking that the Trump official s actions were  Secret Serviceable,  meaning that it was a situation in which law enforcement needs to intervene.This isn t the first time Omarosa has informed the public of the Trump administration s plan to deal with those they view as enemies. In November, Manigault told the Independent Journal Review that  we re keeping a list  of people who have defied Trump. It s so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand,  she said at the time.If a Trump official admitting that the administration is keeping lists of enemies and compiling  dossiers  for blackmail doesn t concern you, then there is something wrong.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"February 14, 2017",0,2687
"Philippine president sidelines police in war on drugs, again","MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered police to halt activities in his deadly war on drugs and leave all operations to the drug enforcement agency, amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct. Duterte s office on Wednesday made public a memorandum telling police, the military and other state bodies to leave to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA)  as sole agency  the conduct of all campaigns and operations. It was unclear why Duterte had ordered the change in the role of the police, who have been responsible for the vast majority of arrests and killings in the 15-month-old campaign. Neither the presidential spokesman nor the communications secretary immediately responded to Reuters  requests for comment. The order could blunt the intensity of the crackdown, since the drug enforcement agency has only a fraction of the manpower of the 190,000-strong police. But it was not the first time the mercurial leader has decreed that the agency lead the drugs war. Duterte suspended police anti-drugs operations in late January, to cleanse a force he called  corrupt to the core , but lifted that ban five weeks later, saying drugs were flooding back to the streets and the gains of the war were being lost. The memorandum, signed on Tuesday, ordered the police force at all times to  maintain police visibility, as a deterrent to illegal activities , while restricting operations to the drug agency. Its aim was  to bring order to the operation or campaign against illegal drugs, thus pinpointing precise accountability , the document said. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest. Critics dispute that and say executions are taking place, with zero accountability, allegations the police reject.  Police and drug enforcement agency spokesman said the two agencies would follow the president s decision, but did not elaborate. Duterte s move follows the August killing of a teenager by police that sparked rare public outrage after a security camera showed the victim in custody, contrary to a police report that he was a drug dealer who tried to shoot them.  It also follows a protest against Duterte last month by thousands of people in Manila, and a series of opinion polls highlighting doubts among many Filipinos about official police accounts, and whether those killed were all drug dealers. A poll released on Sunday showed a sharp decline in public opinion about Duterte s performance and personality, though sentiment about him remained positive overall. Rights lawyers on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court to try and stop the war on drugs, saying it was illegal and allowed the police to circumvent legal procedure.

"WATCH: SMARTPHONE CAPTURES NEW BOATLOAD OF “Scared, Hungry Women and Children” On Their Way To Europe…While 6.6 MILLION More Are Waiting To Cross","Ask your liberal friends to tell you more about these  poor women and children  who are fleeing persecution from radical Islamists in the Middle East The recent surge of migration into Europe has been unprecedented in scope, with an estimated 1 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa this past year alone, making for a massive humanitarian crisis, as well as a political and moral dilemma for European governments. But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.According to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided we re talking worse than those in China, in some cases that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.  PoliticoA leaked German government report has warned, that up to 6.6 million people are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean to cross into Europe, according to details of the classified report leaked to Bild newspaper.Here s a video that s being circulated on social media today, of a boatload of young, male immigrants who are speaking Arabic as they record their trip on a smartphone. Note to bleeding heart liberals: These are clearly not impoverished men or women and children who are escaping persecution by Islamic extremists.New boatload of scared/hungry women and children on their way to Europe. At least they had their smart phone to document the journey. pic.twitter.com/svLUy6mO9K  Based Monitored   (@BasedMonitored) August 22, 2017The high percentage of young males flooding European countries will soon be a very serious problem:Politico   As many governments, including in the United States, debate how many migrants to accept onto their shores, they would be wise to take gender balance into consideration. That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of  North African or Arabic  descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave.Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?That imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.

Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 31 at 6:19 p.m. EDT,"(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday: Trump backs a decision by his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to seek immunity in congressional investigations of possible ties between his campaign and Russia, but there is no immediate sign the request will be granted.  The Trump administration slams China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services. Beijing seeks to play down tensions with the United States and put on a positive face ahead of President Xi Jinping’s first meeting with Trump next week. Senate Democrats step closer to having enough votes to block a confirmation vote on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee with three more Democratic senators coming out against Neil Gorsuch for the lifetime job as a justice. Trump seeks to push his plan for fair trade and more manufacturing jobs back to the top of his agenda by ordering a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clampdown on import duty evasion. Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax overhaul, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts. Democrats are trying to counter Trump’s boldest move yet to defang the U.S. consumer financial watchdog, with 40 current and former lawmakers defending the agency in court. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s scientific integrity watchdog is reviewing whether EPA chief Scott Pruitt violated the agency’s policies when he said in a television interview he does not believe carbon dioxide is driving global climate change, according to an email seen by Reuters. Trump will seek to rebuild the U.S. relationship with Egypt at a meeting on Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi focused on security issues and military aid, a senior White House official says. Trump will host Jordan’s King Abdullah at the White House next week to discuss the fight against Islamic State militants, the Syria crisis and advancing peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the White House says.

Turkey pulls troops out of NATO exercise over 'enemy' list,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is pulling 40 soldiers out of a NATO exercise in Norway, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, after his name appeared in a list of enemies on a poster at the drill, an incident that drew an apology from both the military alliance and Oslo. Turkey has the second largest army in the alliance after the United States, and it borders Syria, Iraq and Iran, lending it great strategic importance for NATO. But the relationship has become increasingly fractious as Ankara drifts away from the alliance and the European Union, alarming the West. Erdogan said an  enemy poster , featuring his name on one side and a picture of modern Turkey s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, on the other, was unfurled at the training exercise in Norway, prompting a decision by Turkey s military chief and European Union minister to pull the troops out.  They said they had decided to pull our troops out and will do so, so we told them to not stop and go ahead ... take our 40 soldiers out of there,  Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party in Ankara. Commenting on the incident at the alliance s Joint Warfare Centre in Stavanger, Norway, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said:  I apologize for the offense that has been caused.   The incidents were the result of an individual s actions and do not reflect the views of NATO,  said Stoltenberg, who is a former Norwegian prime minister, in a written statement. The individual involved, a civilian contractor seconded by Norway and not a NATO employee, was immediately removed from the exercise, Stoltenberg said. It would be up for the Norwegian authorities to decide on any disciplinary action, he added.  Turkey is a valued NATO Ally, which makes important contributions to Allied security, Stoltenberg said. In a separate statement, Norwegian Defence Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen said the offending message had been published on a computer network used during the exercise.  The message does not reflect Norway s views or policies and I apologize for the content of the message,  he said, adding there would be a thorough investigation followed by  appropriate measures .

Australian citizenship crisis deepens as eighth lawmaker falls,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The citizenship crisis engulfing Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s government deepened on Tuesday as an eighth lawmaker exited parliament and the main opposition party drafted in a high-profile candidate for a key by-election. Turnbull s center-right government has already lost its majority in parliament, accounting for four of the eight lawmakers to be forced out or to resign from parliament in recent weeks because they were dual citizens. That status is banned under the Australian constitution to prevent split allegiances. Adherence to that rule in a country where more than half the population of 24 million was either born overseas or has a parent who was born overseas has only come under the spotlight in the current crisis, with the High Court confirming a strict interpretation of the law. Jacqui Lambie, an independent and outspoken senator for the island state of Tasmania, confirmed on Tuesday that she was the eighth lawmaker in a parliament of 226 to fall foul of the dual citizenship law, with political analysts warning that several more are likely to fall. The opposition Labor Party upped the stakes on Tuesday by announcing it was putting forward former state premier Kristina Keneally to contest the seat vacated by a lawmaker in Turnbull s Liberal Party. The by-election in the inner Sydney seat of Bennelong, along with another one for the seat of former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who was ejected by last month s High Court ruling, will be key to restoring Turnbull s small majority in parliament.  This is a chance which I think a lot of people in Australia would like to have that has fallen to the people of Bennelong to send a message against the dysfunction and the chaos of the current government, the policy paralysis, the failure of leadership,  Labor leader Bill Shorten told reporters on Tuesday. While Joyce is widely expected to win back his safe rural seat after renouncing his New Zealand citizenship, the entry of the popular Keneally into the Sydney race has made that contest far less certain. Previously a safe conservative seat, it fell to the Labor Party in 2007, before the conservatives won it back in 2010.  Elections are notoriously volatile, anything is possible,  Nicholas Economou, a political scientist at Monash University, told Reuters.  Voters often use by-elections to give a stinging rebuke to a government that s at war with itself and that s what this government is. It s game on in Bennelong.  The citizenship crisis has hit Turnbull hard, with a poll released on Monday showing he had slipped to a new low in voter popularity amid criticism that he has failed to act decisively. Independent lawmakers have threatened to use their new-found power in the lower house to push through controversial legislation that has been blocked by the government, including a Royal Commission into the banking sector. The government and main opposition party cobbled together a deal on Monday to agree to a deadline of Dec. 1 for all politicians to disclose the birthplace of their parents and grandparents. Lambie vowed to immediately renounce her UK citizenship, granted by descent courtesy of her Scottish-born father.  I won t be laying down, I ll just get up and get back on and go again, simple as that,  she told local radio. Lambie, 43, a former army corporal, has become one of Australia s most recognizable and colorful politicians in her short time in office. She has garnered headlines for a range of controversial comments, including her belief that China could invade Australia and applauding Russian President Vladimir Putin s  very strong leadership .

COLLEGE REPUBLICANS PRESIDENT Attacked by Antifa : “Like a pack of wolves”,"So much for trying to come together like the left always says they think we should do It was a brave gesture but not a smart one for Caleb Slater to try and attend a Black Lives Matter vigil for the young woman who was killed at the riot on Saturday in Charlottesville .The president of a College Republicans chapter said he was attacked and choked by hard-left activists as he attended a vigil for the woman killed Saturday at the Charlottesville Unite the Right demonstration.Ithaca College student Caleb Slater wrote in a statement that masked members of Antifa assaulted him at a Syracuse event held on Sunday in memory of Heather Heyer, who died when a driver plowed into counter-protesters in Virginia.Slater wrote that he wore a Young America s Foundation (YAF) hat to the vigil  as a symbol of peace,  and he hoped showing up to the left-wing Black Lives Matter program as an identifiable conservative would demonstrate that  conservatives condemn the actions of the alt-right just as much as anyone else in our culture.

Thailand rehearses lavish $90 million funeral for late king,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Drums and a band played as officials in black tops and ancient costumes rehearsed on Saturday for the funeral procession of Thailand s late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose cremation next week is expected to be attended by a quarter of a million mourners. Some held a mock-up of a golden urn that had held the remains of dead kings in the past. In the present, the king s body is placed in a coffin but the urn is still used to represent the monarch s remains. The procession rehearsal, which was expected to take up to five hours, passed crowds of black-clad mourners in Bangkok s historic quarter.  Some were visibly moved by the proceedings. Others held gold-framed portraits of the late king. The military government has set 3 billion baht ($90 million) aside for the lavish funeral. Preparations took almost a year to complete, with thousands of artisans working to create an elaborate structure of gold-tipped Thai pavilions in a square in front of the glittering Grand Palace. King Bhumibol, who died on Oct. 13 last year at the age of 87, ruled Thailand for seven decades and is credited by some as having revived the prestige of the monarchy. A revival in the monarchy s popularity was helped by a formidable public relations machine  - the evening news in Thailand includes a daily segment dedicated to the royals and the late king was often featured in his younger days crisscrossing the country to meet the poor and disenfranchised. That public relations drive helped to enshrine the king s status as a demi-god among some of his 68 million subjects. The five-day funeral will be attended by dozens of heads of state including King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck of Bhutan and Japan s Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko, among others. The post-funeral period could be one of uncertainty for many Thais, say analysts, who point to the king s role over the years as a moral compass and arbiter during decades of political upheaval. His only son King Maha Vajiralongkorn formally ascended the throne last year but his coronation will not take place until after his father s funeral. The king s cremation will take place on Oct. 26.  The day has been a declared a national holiday and many businesses have announced they will shut all day or close at midday. More than 10,000 7-Eleven convenience stores across the country, a staple for many Thais, will be shut on the day. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1,2458
WATCH: CNN Reporter Gets SKEWERED For MOCKING Polio Survivor Mitch McConnell After Trump Helps Him Up Stairs,"The CNN  journalist  who posted the video of President Trump helping polio survivor Mitch McConnell up the stairs, following their remarks to the press, will likely backfire, as most Americans will notice the gentle way that President Trump discreetly held Mitch McConnell s arm, as he helped him to navigate the stairs. For most Americans, this video will solidify what they already believe about him, that he is a generous and kind man and not the monster the media would like their followers to believe that he is. CNN political reporter Daniella Diaz sent a tweet on Monday pointing out that President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell locked hands while walking up stairs at the White House following their Rose Garden press conference. Diaz seemed to be mocking the Republican duo   but while followers quickly pointed out that the Kentucky senator is a polio survivor, the tweet remains on her feed nearly 24 hours later.

U.S. Justice Dept seeks to scale back scope of warrant on anti-Trump site,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is scaling back its request to obtain a broad swath of data in connection with an anti-Trump website, after critics accused the department of trampling the free speech rights of political dissidents. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia had previously issued a broader search warrant in July to DreamHost, a Los Angeles-based web hosting company, to obtain data about visitors to website disruptj20.org. Disruptj20 is home to a coalition of political activists who organized disruptive protests during President Donald Trump’s inauguration.  The Justice Department said it sought the records connected to the site amid concerns that it helped facilitate the planning of violent riots on Inauguration Day in which more than 200 people were arrested for rioting and vandalizing businesses in downtown Washington. DreamHost resisted the request, saying the scope of the warrant was too broad and trampled on the rights of 1.3 million visitors to the site, many of whom were simply exercising their First Amendment rights to express their political views. The Justice Department on Tuesday proposed amending the scope of its warrant in a filing with the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Criminal Division, which is slated to hold a hearing over the dispute on Thursday morning. “The warrant - like the criminal investigation - is singularly focused on criminal activity. It will not be used for any other purpose,” it wrote.  “The government has no interest in records relating to the 1.3 million IP addresses that are mentioned in DreamHost’s numerous press releases and opposition brief.” The department proposed asking the court to amend the warrant, and said that DreamHost “should not disclose the contents of unpublished draft publications” or “HTTP request and error logs.” An attorney for DreamHost called the Justice Department’s action “a tremendous win for DreamHost, its users and the public.” But in a statement, DreamHost counsel Raymond Aghaian added: “There remains, unfortunately, other privacy and First and Fourth Amendment issues with the search warrant, which we will address in a separate filing and at the hearing Thursday morning.”",politicsNews,"August 23, 2017 ",1,2304

In a letter sent to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a group of Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives called for  meaningful steps  against Myanmar s military and others who have committed human rights abuses in an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the Southeast Asian nation.

Chicago mayor vows fiscal fix before muni audience,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel tried to reassure municipal credit analysts on Wednesday that the city and its public school district are not falling into a financial abyss. “I will not rest until we fix the fiscal position of both the city and (Chicago Public Schools),” the mayor told the National Federation of Municipal Analysts annual conference. But some attendees said his speech did little to alleviate their worries about the city’s sinking credit. “I’m very concerned. I don’t see them making any headway,” said Susan Dushock, a senior vice president at SunTrust Private Wealth Management, referring to an ongoing political impasse that is hindering Chicago’s efforts. The battle between Illinois’ Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, and Democrats who control the legislature has left the state without a fiscal 2016 budget and has stymied Chicago’s efforts to seek pension relief. Chicago continues to struggle with a structural budget deficit and a $20 billion unfunded pension liability. Rulings by the Illinois Supreme Court both this year and last year have made it much more difficult to enact pension changes to lower that liability. Emanuel likened those rulings to putting “a straightjacket around us,” but vowed to continue negotiating with unions to reach a deal that ensures pensions are paid in a manner that is responsible to taxpayers. He also touted the diverse economy of the nation’s third-largest city, its ability to snag relocating corporations, and educational improvements at schools. “(Emanuel) didn’t focus on how to solve the current fiscal crisis,” said Richard Ciccarone, who heads Merritt Research Services. CPS is also betting on state solutions for escalating pension payments that have left it with a $1 billion budget gap. The district is calling for a bigger share of state funding to cover pensions and the costs of educating poor children. The city and CPS have been hit with downgrades that pushed their credit ratings closer to or into the “junk” level and both are paying a huge penalty in the U.S. municipal bond market. Chicago general obligation bonds due in 22 years were trading at 287 basis points over Municipal Market Data’s benchmark triple-A yield scale, while the so-called credit spread for CPS bonds due in 15 years was 463 basis points, according to MMD.

 81-Year-Old Cuban Run Over By Racist A$$hole,"Florida continues to lead the nation in head shaking insanity after 81-year-old Luis Angel Dominguez, affectionately known to his neighbors as  Papi,  was deliberately run and killed over by a 26-year-old after an argument.As reported by the Washington Post:According to Broward County police, Dominguez and a younger man got into an argument at Everglades Holiday Park on Wednesday night. The younger man, whom police have identified as 26-year-old Kyle Christopher Hannover, was at the park fishing when he allegedly started yelling racial slurs at Dominguez and threw a rock at Dominguez s car.Hannover then allegedly got into his Ford Ranger truck and drove directly toward Dominguez, striking him. He was completely rolled over from the suspect s car and trailer,  a witness told ABC.  When I called 911 it was,  No ambulance.  It was,  Get a trauma chopper out here as quickly as possible. Unsurprisingly, Hannover has a history of violence. In 2015, he was arrested and for allegedly threatening his girlfriend with a shotgun. Considering how disturbed he is, it s amazing that she survived long enough for him to be arrested. As a result of his threats, his guns were confiscated as part of his plea deal this past March. I can only assume that s why Hannover didn t simply shoot Dominguez instead of sadistically running him over.The cause of the fight is unclear and, honestly, is irrelevant. There is literally no justification for a 26-year-old to run over a senior citizen in a rage. The only upshot to this entire incident is that Hannover will probably be about the same age when he gets out of prison.His step-granddaughter Damaris Riveron expressed her gratitude to the police: We re extremely happy there has been an arrest, Thank you to the police department for all of their hard work and for everyone who contributed.

Factbox: One Planet summit turns to private sector for climate action,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting dozens of world leaders along with global companies and movie superstars at a summit in Paris to accelerate efforts to combat climate change.    The  One Planet  summit will not announce internationally binding commitments, but is counting on mobilizing money from public and private financial institutions and from corporations. Below are some key pledges made around the summit. * More than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said they would step up pressure on the world s biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to fight climate change.  They said that would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in such firms. Divestment would only be a last resort. If big emitters refuse to cooperate, shareholders could ratchet up pressure with public statements, resolutions and votes. * The European Commission is  looking positively  at plans to lower capital requirements for environmentally friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy and counter climate change.  The move could be part of a broader set of measures the European Union plans to present in March to meet the target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, for which it estimates around 180 billion euros ($212.2 billion) in additional low-carbon investments are needed per year.  * The World Bank said it will no longer finance upstream oil and gas projects after 2019, apart from certain gas projects in the poorest countries in exceptional circumstances. As a global multilateral development institution, the World Bank said it is continuing to transform its own operations in recognition of a rapidly changing world.  * Belgium will issue its first bond for use in financing projects to reduce the country s carbon emissions, following a number of countries that have sold or plan to sell  green bonds . Poland became the first a year ago, followed by France with a 7 billion euro issue in January.  Belgium plans to sell 3 to 5 billion euros ($3.5-6 billion) in the first quarter of 2018. * Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) said that by end 2025 it will stop funding any utility that relies on coal for more than 5 percent of its energy.  It will support new clients whose reliance on coal is less than 10 percent as long as they have a strategy in place to cut that to close to zero by 2025. ING also will phase out lending to individual coal-fired power plants by then. * French insurer AXA (AXAF.PA) will quadruple investments in environmentally friendly projects, adding 9 billion euros ($10.6 billion) by 2020, and divest further from the coal industry. Axa will target firms deriving more than 30 percent of their revenue from coal. It also will not insure any new coal mines or oil sands projects, including associated pipeline businesses. * French state-owned power utility EDF (EDF.PA) plans a big push into solar energy in France that is likely to cost around 25 billion euros. EDF aims to build 30 gigawatt of solar capacity by 2035 in response to a government drive for a massive deployment of renewables. * French gas and power utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) is prepared to invest 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to improve energy efficiency in France over the next five years, its CEO said ahead of the Paris summit.  Engie says energy efficiency contracts already make up 700 million euros of its operating income and that this is likely to increase fourfold by 2026. ",worldnews,"December 12, 2017 ",1,3572
"In Afghanistan, U.S. senators call for coherent policy from Trump"," (This story corrects the number of U.S. and other foreign troops in Afghanistan, paragraphs 15, 16.) KABUL (Reuters) - A bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators visiting Afghanistan on Tuesday called for a new strategy from the Trump administration to turn the tide against an increasingly strong Taliban insurgency and end the longest war in U.S. history. The delegation led by Senator John McCain was in Kabul on a regional trip that included two days in neighboring Pakistan. The visit preceded an expected Trump review later in the month of the strategy for the United States’ longest war, now in its 16th year, a subject that was largely absent from last year’s presidential campaign. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year and has made Afghanistan the second-ranking country in people seeking refugee status abroad last year, behind Syria. McCain said in a Kabul press briefing on Tuesday at NATO-coalition headquarters that “none of us would say that we are on a course to success here in Afghanistan”. “That needs to change and quickly,” added McCain, a sharp critic of Trump within their Republican party.   McCain was accompanied by U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse and David Perdue on the regional tour. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said she came to get “the view on the ground about what is happening” in Afghanistan. “We need a strategy in the United States that defines our role in Afghanistan, defines our objective and explains how we can get from here to there,” Warren said. U.S. officials have told Reuters that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will present Trump with strategic options for  Afghanistan by mid-July.  Last month, Trump gave Mattis the authority to set American troop levels in Afghanistan, but as commander in chief Trump must sign off on an overall strategy for the war. U.S. security officials have privately said the most likely options will be to increase training and air support by 3,000-5,000 troops for still-inexperienced Afghan security forces, while also tracking down al Qaeda, Islamic State and other global Islamist militants based in Afghanistan.  The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has said “several thousand” more foreign troops – mostly trainers -  are needed to break a military stalemate with the Taliban. In 2001, a U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan toppled the Taliban regime, whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned most women from public life and executed people not seen as sufficiently pious, such as men with beards not considered long enough. More than 15 years later, about 13,000 U.S. and allied troops remain in Afghanistan as part of a training and advising mission in support of an elected government that has increasingly been losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory. Several thousand more American troops operate under a counterterrorism mission aimed at groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda. ",politicsNews,"July 4, 2017 ",1,3256

The conference will be dealing with  social, economic, and environmental issues. Sanders announced the Vatican visit on MSNBC s  Morning Joe.  Sanders made clear he has some differences with the pope but liked that he is  injecting a moral consequence into the economy. Sanders, who is Jewish, is married to Catholic Jane O Meara Sanders. When announcing the news, Sanders said he,  was very moved by the invitation, which just was made public today.  The senator went on to jokingly say that,  you know, people say Bernie Sanders is radical   read what the pope is writing. Via: Daily Caller Meanwhile back in Pope Frances  home country of Argentina, economic crises besiege them with the regularity of earthquakes over a tectonic plate. These crises can be devastating, wiping out family savings, employment and life plans. It seems we re always recovering from or preparing for some sort of economic shock. Sometimes, our survival strategies can even contribute to the subsequent crisis.Last month Argentine voters very narrowly opted for a political sea change, voting out the Peronist faction led by Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (she and her deceased husband governed the country for the last 12 years) and electing the conservative mayor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, to replace her.The business-friendly president-elect ran in opposition to a government that has been highly divisive, defined by extensive social spending and statist economic policies that antagonized large business interests and foreign investors. Kirchner leaves office with a high approval rating of about 50 percent, thanks to popular policies such as a per-child conditional cash transfer policy for poor families and a focus on human rights, such as gay marriage. But the economy is stagnant, annual inflation is around 25 percent, and the fiscal deficit could amount to an alarming 6 percent of the country s GDP this year.President-elect Macri has promised to shock the highly regulated economy into market-based reality. One element of his approach will be the elimination of strict currency controls put in place to prevent capital flight. The cost could be a devaluation of up to 60 percent. Economists, like gym gurus, always seem to argue that a bright future can only be attained with short-term pain.The government s official exchange rate allows you to buy a dollar for about 9.6 pesos. But since 2011, access to dollars has been highly limited in an attempt to keep people and companies from taking money out of the country.U.S. dollars, with the enduring value they represent, are the holy financial grail. From small wads stuffed under a mattress to a security box filled with piles of cash, dollars are the gold standard for Argentines. Dollars are perceived as the objective measure of value   to the point where property, perceived to have enduring value of its own, is priced in dollars.Via: Huffington Post",politics,"Apr 8, 2016",0,3393

"Ryan says U.S. tax reform consensus nears, does not mention border tax","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that tax reform talks are nearing a consensus to lower business taxes by closing loopholes and special interest deductions, the latest sign that the unpopular proposed border tax may not be included. Speaking at a New Balance shoe factory in Massachusetts, Ryan stressed the need to “level the playing field” for U.S. companies and their foreign competitors but failed to mention the border adjustment tax, or BAT, which has been his main policy for creating a more competitive U.S. manufacturing base. Ryan’s remarks, coming about a week ahead of an end-of-July deadline for top White House officials and Republican leaders in Congress to agree on a tax reform framework, could indicate that President Donald Trump’s promised tax code overhaul is taking on a more orthodox shape after months of closed-door talks. Republicans in the House of Representatives had billed the BAT as a more effective way to pay for tax cuts than closing loopholes, because it would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade by effectively taxing imports while exempting exports from taxation.   “We are going to slash the corporate tax rate to level the playing field and the business tax rate for all businesses,” Ryan told his audience. “So what we need to do is, we need to throw out those complicated loopholes, those deductions, those special interest loopholes,” he added.   Ryan said cutting the corporate tax rate from a current 35 percent rate to a 20 percent corporate rate is “very realistic.” Administration officials have said negotiators realize Trump’s proposed 15 percent corporate rate is unlikely without expanding the federal deficit.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on Thursday that Republicans should be willing to accept “short-term increases on deficits” for tax reform to drive economic growth.   Ryan said tax reform would also include accelerating business expensing, double the standard deduction for individuals, and retain popular deductions for charity donations, home mortgages and retirement.  “We have basically found where our consensus lies on these major issues, which we think are sort of the key cornerstones of tax reform,” the Wisconsin Republican said. His failure to mention border tax adjustment could fuel speculation that House Republicans are moving away from the idea in discussions among the so-called Big Six principals. The six are Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House adviser Gary Cohn and the Republican chairmen of two tax-writing committees.

The bill was introduced in the House and is making its way through Congress. It faces a tough battle in the Senate.

 WATCH: Ted Cruz Claims Democrats Are “The Party Of The KKK” And Gets Instantly OWNED With Facts,"Ted Cruz decided to smear present-day Democrats as supporters of the Ku Klux Klan in defense of Jeff Sessions, and it spectacularly backfired.When Donald Trump nominated Sessions for Attorney General, an uproar ensued because of Sessions  racism over the course of his career.As a United States attorney, Sessions attempted to suppress the black vote in Alabama by prosecuting three civil rights activists for helping black people vote.Sessions  racism is so bad that Republicans rejected his nomination for a judgeship in 1986. Even Coretta Scott King strenuously opposed his nomination in a letter that has since resurfaced.King wrote that Sessions  lacks the temperament, fairness, and judgement to be a federal judge  and has  used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens. She continued by warning that Sessions  would irreparably damage the work of my husband. When Senator Elizabeth Warren attempted to read the letter on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Republicans silenced her in defense of their racist colleague, who if confirmed, would gut the Justice Department and prevent it from protecting civil rights and voting rights.Cruz joined his colleagues in silencing Warren and he defended Sessions during an interview on Fox News by trying to link Democrats with the KKK. It s one of the crutches  when the left doesn t have any other arguments, they go and just accuse everyone of being a racist. The Democrats are the party of the Ku Klux Klan. You look at the most racist  you look at the Dixiecrats, they were Democrats who imposed segregation, imposed Jim Crow laws, who founded the Klan. The Klan was founded by a great many Democrats. Now, the Democrats accuse anyone they disagree with of being a racist. That was a false smear of Jeff Sessions and I think he will make an extraordinary attorney general. Here s the video via YouTube:While it s true that Democrats of the past did, indeed, support the KKK, it should be noted that the Dixiecrats Cruz speaks of became Republicans after Democrats pushed for passage of the Civil Rights Act. Later on, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan would employ the  Southern Strategy  to complete the Republican abandonment of Abraham Lincoln.Democrats have worked hard over the last 70 years to recover from their racist history, and have successfully done so by passing landmark legislation protecting voting rights and civil rights.Cruz is also wrong about Democrats being  the party of the KKK.  That claim may have worked in 1870 or in 1930, but it definitely won t work today, especially since the KKK formally endorsed Donald Trump and celebrated after Trump nominated Sessions.In fact, Sessions once said that he liked the KKK until he found out that they smoked marijuana. Apparently he had no problem with their racism and hate and terrorism against black people.In response, Twitter users roasted Cruz.#morningjoe Ted Cruz said democrats are the KKK. The Republicans have nominated KKK leaders. Who represents the KKK now?

Brazil poll shows Temer approval plummets on new graft charges,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The approval rating for Brazilian President Michel Temer s scandal-plagued government has sunk further since new  corruption charges were brought against him, and 92 percent of Brazilians do not trust him, a new poll published on Thursday showed. The survey by pollster Ibope said the number of people who consider Temer s government  bad  or  terrible  rose to 77 percent from 70 percent in the previous survey carried out in July. The proportion of those who rate his government as  great  or  good  slipped to just 3 percent from 5 percent. Only 6 percent of Brazilians still trust Temer, down from 10 percent, the poll said. The government s approval rating collapsed in July after Temer was hit by a first corruption charge that was blocked by Congress in August, which saved him from standing trial before the Supreme Court. But federal prosecutors filed new accusations against him of obstructing justice and being a member of a criminal organization in a corruption case involving the owners of the world s largest meatpacker JBS SA. They accused Temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate the president. The lower house of Congress, which has the authority to decide whether a president should be put on trial, is expected to vote on the new charges in mid-October at the earliest.  Analysts expect the Congress to again reject a Supreme Court trial for Temer, putting him on course to serve out his term until the end of 2018. But the corruption debate will delay passage of his plan to overhaul Brazil s costly pension system, a key measure to bring a gaping budget deficit under control.  He was already a very unpopular president proposing unpopular measures. Now there is the perception that he, his cabinet and his ruling coalition are involved in a series of wrongdoings,  said Lucas de Arag o, partner at the Brasilia-based political risk consultancy Arko Advice. Temer s ratings have fallen below the worst result of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff, whom he succeeded when she was impeached last year. Rousseff and her Workers Party called her ouster a  coup  orchestrated by Temer and his allies so they could shield themselves from corruption investigations. Thursday s poll was commissioned by the National Confederation of Industry lobby and surveyed 2,000 people between Sept. 15-20 across Brazil. It has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.

Factbox: Eyes on U.S. terrorism watchlists after Orlando shootings,"(Reuters) - As facts emerge about Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, questions have arisen about how well-known he was to U.S. intelligence agencies. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Monday that Mateen was on a watchlist between May 2013 and March 2014 while he was under investigation after claiming a connection to or support for multiple Islamist extremist groups, including al Qaeda, Hezbollah, al-Nusra and Islamic State. The FBI maintains three watchlists and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence runs one database. People are placed on a watchlist according to the threat level they are believed to pose. Comey did not specify which watchlist named Mateen.  Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton has supported stricter gun laws and said on Monday she would push for laws that would prevent people on a no-fly list from buying guns. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has embraced gun rights, said he would meet with the leading U.S. gun rights group about preventing people on a government watchlist from buying guns. The U.S. government maintains the following databases: Terrorist Watchlist or Terrorist Screening Database (about 420,000 names): Established after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Terrorist Watchlist is intended “to positively identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the U.S, board aircraft, or engage in other activity.” Prior to 2001, intelligence agencies maintained dozens of individual lists. The Terrorist Watchlist is run by the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center with the goal of consolidating the U.S. government’s watchlists into a single database.   No-Fly List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Screening Database, the No-Fly List prohibits people known or suspected of terrorism from boarding a plane that departs from or arrives in the United States.   Selectee List (about 16,000 names): A subset of the Terrorist Watchlist, the Selectee List includes individuals who are permitted to fly, but receive more intensive screening. In addition to the thousands of records updated daily from federal, state and local law enforcement, the Selectee List provides an additional level of screening for individuals thought to present a greater threat.  Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database (about 1.1 million names): Run by the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the Office of the National Director of Intelligence, the TIDE Database shares information with the FBI’s watchlists. As of December 2013, it contained about 1.1 million people, about 25,000 of them U.S. citizens. Unlike the FBI’s database, TIDE is viewable only by counterterrorism professionals in the U.S. intelligence community and is not shared with local law enforcement.  Federal agencies propose people for inclusion on the TIDE database based on an evaluation of the threat they pose. Reasons someone may be added to the TIDE database include committing terrorist activity, preparing or planning a terrorist activity or providing support, such as funds or housing, for a terrorist organization.

OBAMA’S LAWLESS AMERICA: CA Police Tell Violent Anti-Trump Protesters “Leave Now Or You Will Be Arrested”…Protesters Shout Back “WE DON’T FOLLOW THE LAW”,"Barack Obama s legacy will be a divided, lawless, mooching, disrespectful America. Obama has been very clear about his open alliance with Black Lives Matter terrorists and professional race baiters for hire. Ever since the death of thug Trayvon Martin, when Obama began his first strategy meetings with Al Sharpton and his former AG, racist Eric Holder, he s been shamelessly holding closed-door meetings at our White House. His meetings have been met with criticism by many Americans for hosting unsavory characters, like the guy wearing a tracking device on his ankle for kidnapping and rappers who threaten to harm fellow Americans if the election doesn t go their way at our White House. All the while, Obama has been subtly encouraging the masses to keep up the fight against law enforcement and to not let up on the oppressive white man. These violent protests are NOT spontaneous. They are happening as a result of a well planned, highly strategized and well-funded group of hard core leftists, who will stop at nothing to ensure their radical agenda is not upended by the shocking rise of the unafraid Donald Trump.YThis anti-Trump mob began their organized disruptions last night in San Jose, CA.

Mexican cement maker ready to help Trump build border wall,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican cement maker is ready to lend its services to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to build the wall he wants to erect on the southern border of the United States to curb immigration. “We can’t be choosy,” Enrique Escalante, Chief Executive Officer of Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua (GCC) said in an interview. “We’re an important producer in that area and we have to respect our clients on both sides of the border.” Republican Trump campaigned vowing to build a “big, beautiful, powerful” wall across the 2,000 mile (3,200 km) frontier in order to stop illegal immigrants from Mexico, which he accused of sending rapists and drug traffickers north. The campaign of the New York businessman who has never previously held public office was widely reviled in Mexico. Parts of the border are already divided by high fences, and a huge part of the boundary runs along the Rio Grande river. Based in Chihuahua, a large northern state bordering Texas and New Mexico, GCC is one of the biggest construction materials companies in Mexico. It generates around 70 percent of its sales in the United States, where it also has three plants. Escalante said Trump’s plans to invest in energy and infrastructure in the United States augured well for the firm.     “For the business we’re in, Trump is a candidate that does favor the industry quite a bit,” Escalante said. GCC, whose shares are trading at their highest levels since 2008, is 23 percent owned by Mexican multinational cement company Cemex, which at the end of September announced plans to sell its stake.

 WATCH: Trump Surrogate Tries To Defend Trump Sacrifice Interview And Fails Hard," It s a trap!  That s the messaging that the Trump campaign has decided to go with when asked about Trump s response to the father of a Muslim man who died while serving as an American Army captain overseas. It s a narrative that the Trump campaign uses often   if Trump says something horrible on camera it s because the media twisted his words. One of Trump s surrogates, Scottie Nell Hughes, tried to use this tactic during a segment on CNN s New Day on Sunday morning.The father, Khizr Khan, spoke at the Democratic National Convention, where he called out Trump for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Khan said during his speech that Trump has sacrificed nothing or no one in his life.Trump, a billionaire, responded by saying: I think I ve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I ve had tremendous success. I think I ve done a lot. This response came out during an interview with George Stephanopoulos.Hughes says that she was initially disappointed with Trump s comments about Khan. However, once she realized that the interview was a part of the media s agenda to make Trump look bad, which is apparently something he could never do on his own in the mind of a Trump supporter, she has to tell people the truth   it s all a giant media conspiracy. Now that I ve read the questions and the Trump campaign and others have released the full transcript, you can see what a setup this is. Which was nothing but to trap Mr. Trump going forward. The truth is that Trump is trapped. He is trapped by the vile rhetoric that he has spewed throughout the primary election. He went full fascist and it is preventing him from being able to effectively pivot more to the middle in order to win the votes he needs to win a general election.Hughes, like many other Trump supporters, are in for a rude awakening when if they are capable of doing so   they realize that they backed a losing candidate.You can watch Hughes desperately try to rationalize Trump s horrendous comments below.#Trump to #KhizrKhan ""I've made a lot of sacrifices"" @VictorBlackwell gets reax from @scottienhughes @asbthelawhttps://t.co/imMsHa8ARQ  New Day (@NewDay) July 31, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"July 31, 2016",0,2398
Judges consider HK double murder appeal by convicted former British banker,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Three judges in Hong Kong s Court of Appeal are set to decide the fate of a former British banker who was jailed for life last year for the murder of two Indonesian women he tortured and raped after his appeal hearing closed on Wednesday.    Rurik Jutting, 32, a former Bank of America employee, had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, in his luxury apartment in 2014 on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders. The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the Asian financial hub. During the one and a half day appeal hearing in the former British colony, Jutting s lawyers said the judge who presided over the gruesome trial last year had misdirected the jury. Defence lawyer Gerard McCoy argued that the judge had narrowed down the scope of the defence case by conflating an abnormality of mind with a psychiatric disorder. Jutting s defence is that while a disorder can cause an abnormal mind, his mental state can be abnormal without a disorder. McCoy said Jutting showed severe traits of psychiatric disorders, far beyond the normal range and was therefore not in control of his actions, said McCoy.  Abnormality of mind is absolutely not confined to a disorder or a disease. Here the judge locks it down, reinforcing to the jury it is disorder,  he said. Jutting, dressed in a navy blue shirt and thick squared glasses, watched animatedly throughout the hearing and occasionally chuckled, particularly during the presentations by prosecutor John Reading. Reading stated that the previous judge had  exercised considerable care in crafting his directions on the law in consultation with both sides . Judges Michael Lunn, Andrew Macrae and Kevin Zervos are to return judgement on the appeal which may include granting Jutting the opportunity for a new trial, but they did not give a time frame.  Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said in strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial last year that the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known. He described Jutting as the  archetypal sexual predator  who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that it was possible he would murder again if freed. The jury unanimously found Jutting, the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman, guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in November 2016. Jutting s defence team had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse, as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism, had impaired his ability to control his behavior. The prosecution rejected this, stating Jutting was able to form judgments and exercise self-control before and after the killings, filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies. In previous high profile murder cases such as that of Nancy Kissel, an American woman serving a life sentence for the  milkshake  murder of her Merrill Lynch banker husband, retrials have been given.  Kissel lost her final appeal against her conviction in 2014.   ",worldnews,"December 13, 2017 ",1,3373
Senate Democrat Ron Wyden demands Justice Dept release new crime reduction policies,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading Senate Democrat on Tuesday accused U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions of concealing policy recommendations that could change how the Justice Department enforces laws on illegal immigration, drug trafficking and violent crime. In a letter to Sessions, Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden said the Justice Department should release recommendations made by the Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, noting that the policy changes could end up hurting Americans. “These [Justice Department] decisions could have dramatic and wide-ranging consequences for Americans’ daily lives,” Wyden wrote, noting that the task force’s work could impact everything from marijuana and asset forfeiture policies to hate crimes, immigration and human trafficking. “Yet Americans remain in the dark about the content of the task force’s recommendations.” The Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety was established through an executive order by President Donald Trump in February. Names of those serving on the task force have not been published, and the group was supposed to deliver its recommendations by July 27. In a public statement last week, Sessions said he had received recommendations “on a rolling basis” and he had already “been acting on the task force’s recommendations to set the policy of the department.” A Justice Department spokesman referred to Sessions’ prior statement when asked for comment, saying the department will “make announcements on policy changes as appropriate.” The department has already announced a few policy changes that stem from the task force’s work. Earlier this month, for instance, the department said it plans to reinstate a controversial civil asset forfeiture program that lets local police departments seize cash from people without first charging them with a crime, even if their states do not condone such a policy.  The policy had been rolled back during the Obama administration amid concerns it was allowing the government to take away peoples’ property without due process. In May, the department also undid another Obama-era policy to allow for tougher charges and longer prison sentences.  Wyden, whose state voted to legalize the use of recreational marijuana, said he was particularly concerned about the “secrecy shrouding” recommendations related to the drug. Sessions has previously made critical comments about marijuana use. “It is not the role of the Attorney General to unilaterally undermine the will of Oregon voters,” he wrote.

 Here’s The Exact Moment CNN Got A Sitting Congressman To Admit Donald Trump Is A Racist (VIDEO),"CNN has been heavily criticized for its coverage of Donald Trump s rise and rightfully so. For months, one of the most watched news networks in America deferred to the  both sides  model of false equivalency that had been standard practice for years. Recently, as Trump clinched the Republican nomination and it became clear that he has no intention of being  more presidential,  something in the minds of the network s reporters and hosts  clicked.  They finally seem to get it. Donald Trump is a despicable person and no amount of  he said, she said  is going to blunt that fact.So they ve changed. And in doing so have absolutely upped their game.On a recent episode of At This Hour, hosts John Berman and Kate Bolduan put on a masterclass on how to press a Trump supporter to get right down to the uncomfortable truth at the very root of Trump s campaign. They invited on freshman congressman Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) and slowly demolished his talking points. Watching a human being get so thoroughly decimated is never easy, but given Zeldin s baffling support for Trump it s hard to say he didn t have it coming. He knows Trump is a racist   just ask him.After Zeldin tried to dismiss Trump s comments about his Hispanic judge as a  regrettable mistake,  the pair of hosts didn t let him off the hook. If Donald Trump is engaging in racism, are you still comfortable supporting him? Zeldin tried to change the subject, as he no doubt was trained to do. But Bolduan and Berman weren t buying it. After trying to use the opportunity to pivot to bashing Hillary Clinton, Bolduan interrupts. I m not saying Are you now voting for Hillary Clinton? , but are you still endorsing Donald Trump if you think he s engaging in racism? Well, yes, it s Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton and it s a no brainer between the two of them Are you essentially saying  Yes he s a racist, but he s our racist ? Boom!Zeldin has to admit that while Trump s comments are indeed racist, he thinks in Trump s  heart  that he isn t a white supremacist. (A tip for any aspiring politicians: If you have to go on national television to tepidly argue that deep inside your candidate isn t as racist as he looks, you ve already lost.)Again Berman holds his feet to the fire: Sorry but what would you call someone who makes racist statements? Everyone calls them a racist. So if Donald Trump is making racist statements, you re saying he s a racist! Hahaha.The exchange ends with Zeldin throwing up the last, most desperate argument he and his party has in their playbook: Trump may be a racist, but Obama is a bigger racist. The look on the hosts  faces is absolutely priceless.Watch the full, cringeworthy exchange below:Featured image via CNN",News,"June 7, 2016",0,2808
OBAMA WILL SKIP SCALIA FUNERAL: Here’s A List Of The Other Funerals He Was Too Busy To Attend,"With a battle heating up between Republicans and Obama on a Supreme Court nomination, the president chooses to skip the funeral of longtime Supreme Court Justice Scalia. This is a classless move by Obama who s got a track record of not showing up at important funerals. He expects the Republicans to be bipartisan, yet he shows his true colors when he does something like this. The White House has confirmed reports that President Barack Obama will not be attending the funeral of late Supreme Court Justice Scalia s funeral which is scheduled for Saturday. Instead, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will pay their respects to Scalia on Friday, when the Justice s body lies in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court building. The White House added that Vice President Joe Biden will attend Saturday s funeral at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.The last supreme court justice to pass away was Justice William Rehnquist in 2005. Then-President George W. Bush not only attended the service, but delivered a eulogy along with Justice Sandra Day O Connor.Critics claim that his decision not to attend Justice Scalia s funeral is just the latest in a string of snubs over the past several years. While Obama has attended some high profile funerals like those of former South African President Nelson Mandela and Senator and ex-KKK member Robert Byrd, the president has skipped out services for a number of high-profile conservatives and members of the U.S. military:Margaret Thatcher When the Iron Lady passed away in 2013, the Obama administration sent what the Daily Signal referred to as  a low-level delegation similar in size and scope to the delegation sent to the funeral of Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. Chris Kyle After Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle was murdered on a gun range in 2013, the president opted not to attend his Texas funeral. Furthermore, the president ruffled even more feathers by failing to acknowledge Kyle in his State of the Union address which was held on the same day.Major General Harold Greene Army Major General Harold Greene became the highest ranking combat fatality since Vietnam after he was ambushed by an Afghan police officer in August of 2014.

GAME OVER SNOWFLAKES! TRUMP Channels Reagan…Threatens Violent Berkeley College Rioters…COMPARE TO REAGAN’S No Nonsense Response To Berkeley Rioters In 1966 [VIDEO],"Last night, at the birthplace of free speech, we watched as rioters took to the campus of Berkeley College to shut down the free speech of gay conservative Milo Yiannopoulos. The speech was scheduled in advance, and police were aware that angry Democratic Party supporters and anarchists were likely to cause chaos and threaten the security of students who attended the event, as well as the guest speaker. After violent riots broke out, which included hundreds of rocks and firecrackers thrown at police, the event was cancelled. Yiannopoulos was rushed out of the building and taken to a place of safety. It s important to note, that only 1 month ago, these violent riots would have likely been ignored by President Obama. But this is not 1 month ago. This is now, and now, we have a new sheriff in town. We have a President who respects the free speech rights of every American, whether he agrees or disagrees with them. We have a President who will not sit back and allow innocent citizens to be threatened by violent radicals who are breaking the law.Here is an example of the violence that was exacted on innocent people who were interested in hearing the opinions and facts of scheduled presenter, gay conservative Milo Yionnopoulos:President Donald J. Trump s response to the violence and the shutting down of these peaceful American s free speech rights was swift. He put essentially put all of Berkeley College on notice. Stop the violence and shutting down of 1st Amendment rights on your campus or possibly lose federal funding:  If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?UC Berkeley, one of the top research universities in the world, receives $370 million in federal funds used for research funding. The University of California system as a whole receives nearly $8.5 billion in federal support.If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017Compare and contrast Reagan s decision to address the unlawful behavior of the Berkeley protesters while he was the acting Governor of California in 1966:In his 1966 campaign for California governor, Republican Ronald Reagan promised to  to clean up the mess at Berkeley.  Reagan was referring to the unrest prevalent not just at the University of California, Berkeley, but on college campuses throughout state. Students and faculty alike were engaged in protests, demonstrations, and strikes related to issues such as the draft, civil rights, discrimination, and women s liberation.In one 1966 campaign speech, Reagan declared that many leftist campus movements had transcended legitimate protest, with the actions of  beatniks, radi cals and filthy speech advocates  having become more to do  with riot ing, with anarchy  than  academic freedom.  He blamed university administrators and faculty, who  press their particular value judgments  on students, for  a leadership gap and a morality and decency gap  on campus, and suggested a code of conduct be imposed on faculty to  force them to serve as examples of good behavior and decency. [1]Six months after Reagan took office in 1967, he wrote this letter to Glenn Dumke, the chancellor of San Francisco State College, one of California s largest public institutions. Dumke served as the public face of the state college system, and he was a staunch opponent of radical student and faculty demonstrations. In his letter to Dumke, Reagan criticizes liberal activism on campuses. He condemns  these people & this trash  on campuses as well as  the excuse of academic freedom & freedom of expression  in allowing protests and demonstrations to go on.  We wouldn t tolerate this kind of language in front of our families,  Reagan writes of campus protesters. He urges Dumke to  lay down some rules of conduct,  promising that  you d have all the backing I could give you. HERE IS THE TRANSCRIPT OF REAGAN S LETTER:Dear GlennHow far do we go in tolerating these people & this trash under the excuse of academic freedom & freedom of expression? Please understand, that question isn t made in any tone of accusation. I mean myself too in that use of the term  we. We wouldn t let a LeRoi Jones in our livingroom and we wouldn t tolerate this kind of language in front of our families. Hasn t the time come to take on those neurotics in our faculty group and lay down some rules of conduct for the students comparable to what we d expect in our own families? If we do and the  we  this time means you d have all the backing I could give you, I believe the people of Calif. would take the state college system to their hearts.[illegible] Ron ",politics,"Feb 2, 2017",0,4942

 Big Corp. Is So Afraid Of A Liberal SCOTUS They Just Settled A MASSIVE Lawsuit,"It looks like Justice Antonin Scalia s untimely death is not just causes Republicans to lose their minds in fear, a giant corporation embroiled in a class action lawsuit is just as scared. In fact, they are so afraid of the possibility of a split or liberal Supreme Court that they have settled their lawsuit for almost a billion dollars.Dow Chemical was set to go in front of the SCOTUS after a 2013 ruling by a Kansas court upheld a massive $1.06 billion judgement against the company for price-fixing. The company sued and found liable after being accused of colluding with four other chemical companies (Bayer AG, BASF SE, Huntsman International LLC and Lyondell Chemical Co.) to fix the prices of polyether polyol products   which are used to make urethane foam   in order to overcharge customers in the  90s and early 2000s.The company was counting on Scalia to rule in their favor and overturn the huge judgement, but then he died. His death meant that one of two things would happen 1.) they d go in front of 8 justices and get a split decision which would uphold the $1.06 billion ruling, or 2.) they would face a liberal court if Obama gets someone on the court and the judgement would also be upheld. When they realized that they were screwed they issued a statement announcing they d settled and blamed it on Scalia s death:The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW) has entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the In re Urethanes Class Action litigation. In this settlement agreement, Dow has agreed to pay the plaintiff class $835 million Growing political uncertainties due to recent events within the Supreme Court and increased likelihood for unfavorable outcomes for business involved in class action suits have changed Dow s risk assessment of the situation. Dow believes this settlement is the right decision for the company and our shareholders.Translation: Scalia died and f*cked us over, so now we are being forced to pay $835 million to all of the people we hurt.Scalia s death didn t just hurt Dow though, there are a number of other huge corporations set to go in front of the court, including Microsoft and Tyson Foods.What s actually really infuriating about this is that Dow was so sure that they were going to win this case until Scalia croaked. This guy was such a corporate shill (as are the rest of the conservative members) that big companies who had judgements levied against them were happy to go in front of the court because they knew they d win.So, while this sudden settlement may be hilarious, it is also pretty damning. It really highlights how much the conservative Supreme Court has hurt average Americans in order to help big business.Featured image via Wikipedia",News,"February 26, 2016",0,2788
Trump to propose deduction on childcare spending: aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will propose allowing parents to deduct spending on childcare from their income taxes in a speech on Monday meant to challenge the economic policies of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, a campaign aide said. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said on Sunday in outlining the plan: “We don’t want it to be an economic disadvantage to have children.” The aide said the campaign would have a more detailed childcare plan in the future. A wealthy businessman seeking his first public office, Trump seeks to counter Clinton’s argument he is out of touch with the problems of working families. He will also say that, unlike Clinton, his business policies would encourage companies to remain in the United States, a concern of blue-collar workers he has tried to court, the aide said. In his speech, to business leaders of the Detroit Economic Club, Trump will also propose stronger protections for American intellectual property and a temporary moratorium on new regulations, the aide said. Seeking to move beyond a week of discord, Trump will outline  plans for trade, taxes, regulation and energy policy. His plans include proposing a 15 percent corporate tax rate, an idea that is on his website. The current federal rate is 35 percent. Senior aides and supporters said in television appearances on Sunday that Trump wanted to put behind him his disputes of last week with Republican Party leaders and the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. With the economy a major issue, Clinton on Thursday lays out a plan of her own for the “biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War Two,” her campaign said. A Democrat like President Barack Obama, Clinton will be buoyed by figures released on Friday showing U.S. employment rose more than expected for a second month in a row in July and wages picked up, bolstering expectations of faster economic growth. Clinton has pledged that no family should pay more than 10 percent of its income on childcare. She has called for a tax cut to help middle-class parents cope with rising childcare costs and an expansion of a federally funded program that provides education and health services to low-income families with young children. In a phone call lasting little more than an hour on Sunday and run by some of Trump’s most senior aides, members of his newly announced economic advisory group shared their views on policy, said banker Stephen Calk, one of the members who took part. The Clinton campaign has criticized Trump over the advisory group, announced on Friday, for including no women and relying on members who come from hedge funds and investment banking, a make-up at odds somewhat with Trump’s populist message. Calk, chief executive of Federal Savings Bank and National Bancorp Holdings, said Trump had asked advisory group members to nominate women and minorities who could be added to the group. He said there were some “big, recognizable” names on the call who would be announced soon as joining the team but did not elaborate. A new Washington Post-ABC News opinion poll on Sunday showed Trump trailing Clinton by 8 percentage points after her party’s convention in Philadelphia. A Reuters/Ipsos poll out on Friday showed the race closer three months ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. ",politicsNews,"August 7, 2016 ",1,3407
LISTEN TO JEH JOHNSON’S BIZARRE REASON We Must Remove Confederate Statues…”Homeland Security” Threat? [Video],"This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!A single protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee turned violent last week. Charlottesville, WV was the sight of the engineered confrontation of two groups that got out of hand because the police officers were told to stand down.Jeh Johnson served as Secretary of Homeland Security under Obama but failed miserably to keep our homeland secure. We now have a mess that President Trump is trying to clean up. Johnson allowed violent gangs like MS13 to enter towns across America. He allowed thousands of illegal alien minor children to just roam free. Johnson is responsible for much of the illegal alien crime we re seeing now. The lawless policy of Obama and Johnson hurt many Americans.So now Johnson is saying that it s a problem that rallying Americans who want to keep Confederate statues are the violent ones??? THE VIOLENCE IS COMING FROM ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER ON THE LEFT!THIS IS NOT TRUE:  What alarms so many of us from a security perspective is that so many of the statues, the Confederate monuments, are now, modern-day, becoming symbols and rallying points for white nationalism, for neo-Nazis, for the KKK, and this is most alarming,  Johnson said.  We fought a world war against Naziism. The KKK reigned terror on African Americans for generations. I salute those in cities and states who are taking down a lot of these monuments for reasons of public safety and security,  he added.  And that s not a a matter of political correctness. That s a matter of public safety and homeland security and doing what s right. Host Martha Raddatz said she felt the Trump administration would call that a  slippery slope,  referring to local Washington locations like Washington-Lee High School and Jefferson Davis Highway. Where should that stop?  Raddatz asked.Johnson said those kinds of decisions should be made at the local level.President Donald Trump slammed the removal of such monuments as  foolish  and for ripping apart the  history and culture of our great country.

 Trump Outlines How He’ll Treat America Like A Bankrupt Business And It Is TERRIFYING,"There s a furniture company in Southern Maine called  Chapter 11 Furniture.  The name and the entire concept of the company is to invoke the feeling of a fire sale. They have 4 or 5 stores that they only sign short leases on, so at any given time they can advertise,  Chapter 11 Furniture is losing its lease in (enter town or street name here) and EVERYTHING MUST GO!  It s a brilliant tactic for a company who will probably never resort to its name because it understands how to build from American greed at its very core. Someone is going our of business or declaring bankruptcy? It s a free for all!That s the American mentality surrounding bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is there to help people in severe financial situations put their debt behind them and move on. It s also a way for sheisters to get a bunch of free stuff, make a bunch of money and work the system. Donald Trump qualifies as the second type; working the system   and openly admitting it   4 times now. Trump s idea to  fix America  has taken a turn toward this mentality and the very thought of it is frightening,The New York Times reported that in an interview Thursday, Donald Trump talked about how he would approach the national debt. Thinking like a failed businessman, he insisted we should simply go to our creditors and ask them to take less. Yes, in one idiotic statement, Donald Trump exposed just how little he knows about the economy or how the debt works. As The Times points out, there is no credible evidence suggesting that our debtors would reduce we owe them by a nickel. Trump thinks he s dealing in people with real estate they can t move selling bad debt for more bad debt until one day so much of the debt is paper   bad paper   that there s nothing left to do but fail. Sound familiar? It should; it s what Wall Street and the Dubya administration did to us in 2008.Let s assume for a moment that our creditors would take less. The bulk of the national debt is money we owe to ourselves. Is Trump going to ask the Social Security trust fund to take pennies on the dollar because we had a couple of wars that were too expensive and some handouts to fix the mess? How much less should those people who won t be able to retire when the fund is wiped out take? They ve been putting 6.2 percent of their paycheck into that fund since they started working. How much less should they settle for?As for our other creditors, We re not defaulting on rented furniture. We owe other countries a great deal of money, plus interest, that they provided to us in cash. We use that money to fund the government. If creditors start seeing those kinds of tactics we ll have our credit rating lowered and lose credibility as a country. There s also a good chance the dollar would be removed as the world standard currency. Ask Donald Trump what he ll do when we can t just print more money.The bottom line is, Trump has no idea what he s talking about. The national debt is one of the most misunderstood components of the federal government. For someone to seek the office that holds much influence over how that debt shrinks or grows without understanding it is preposterous, but then again   we are talking about Donald Trump.Featured image from billingsgazette.com",News,"May 6, 2016",0,3322

 Trump Gets Stomped By Twitter After DEMANDING Obama Be Investigated For Sharing ‘Top Secret’ Info (TWEETS),"Uh oh, you guys, President Obama is in trouble! On Friday, Donald Trump expressed outrage  outrage   that he had not yet been briefed on his  best friend  Putin s campaign to hack his political opponents for him and effectively install a living container of Tang as a puppet-President when NBC received a summary of the report. Sure, the actual, current President saw the report before the media was informed about some details, but The Donald genuinely believes that he should have been briefed before his scheduled Friday meeting.Now, I know what you re thinking: why is Trump suddenly so interested in the intelligence briefings he has skipped religiously since forever. Well, this involves him   and his feigned outrage simply gives him another excuse to attack Everyone But Putin. In fact, while Trump doesn t want anyone to look into Russia s interference with our election, he is demanding an investigation into the leaked report. That s right   he doesn t like leaks now.I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.  Donald J.

OccupythePort (@occupytheport) January 6, 2017To be clear, the White House denies all responsibility for notifying the media   not of  top secret  information as Trump claims, but of the basics: intelligence agencies have identified multiple Russians they can confirm as having delivered information to Julian Assange   meaning Assange lied when he claimed the info did not come from Russia, and Trump lied repeatedly while mindlessly parroting those claims while taking no interest in the actual investigation.Friday afternoon, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted that Trump tweeted a  steadfast defense of the integrity  of Wikileaks, a website run by an alleged rapist who has been hiding from charges for years, and noted that Julian Assange is  the leading purveyor  of the release of classified material.While Earnest did not directly accuse Trump of being involved in the hack, he told the press that Trump s tweet-demand for investigations leads me to conclude that his concerns are about something other than protecting classified information.

U.S. citizen facing subversion charges in Zimbabwe released from jail,"HARARE (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen accused of attempting to subvert President Robert Mugabe s government was released from Zimbabwe s maximum security jail on Friday, a day after the High Court ordered her to be freed on bail, Reuters witnesses said. Judge Clement Phiri ruled on Thursday that there was a  patent absence of facts  in the state s case against 25-year-old Martha O Donovan, whose arrest last week centered on accusations she insulted 93-year-old Mugabe in a Twitter post. She denies the accusation. Reuters witnesses saw O Donovan leaving prison in a United States embassy vehicle. O Donovan and her lawyers did not speak to reporters waiting outside Chikurubi Maximum Prison on the outskirts of Harare. State prosecutors accuse O Donovan of writing a Twitter post in October calling Mugabe a  selfish and sick man .  The government has since last year been targeting activists and government critics who use social media to speak out against Mugabe, cash shortages in banks and a foreign currency crunch that has caused a sharp rise in prices. Amnesty International said it feared O Donovan would not be the last to be arrested in the government s  clamp down on social media platforms .  Activist pastor Evan Mawarire, whose #ThisFlag movement last year organized the biggest stay-at-home demonstration in a decade, is on trial on a charge of subversion. He faces a separate trial for a similar offence. ",worldnews,"November 10, 2017 ",1,1490

 Michelle Obama: Research Proves We Can Lift Economy By Educating Girls,"During her time in the White House, First Lady Michelle Obama has championed so many important causes   many of them geared toward helping children and women around the world.One of these crucial initiatives, launched last year, was Let Girls Learn   an effort to educate teenage girls. This effort was backed by studies that showed that when women and girls are educated, a nation s economy rises. In an interview with a U.S. Agency for International Development publication, Michelle said: Studies from the World Bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl s future income by 15 to 25 percent. And we know that when girls are educated, they are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children, and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates. Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country s GDP. The link between the education of girls and a nation s GDP has been made before   and thanks to an analysis by Politifact, we now know that there s a lot of truth to that statement.According to research, when there are more girls in school, there is a higher gross domestic product   although there is some uncertainty if it s a stronger economy that results in more girls being educated, or if having more girls in school leads to the rise of a nation s economy. One policy report from the World Bank said: By effectively educating more women   that is, providing more women with a high-quality education   more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results. Although educating girls has been shown to improve the economy, this doesn t account for any obstacles women might encounter even if they are educated. Sexism and gender inequality can still have an impact on the economy even as efforts are made to put more girls in school and give them more resources and opportunities. According to a 2009 article in the journal Feminist Economics, the economic benefit will be lost if companies refuse to hire educated girls.However, the gains of educating girls are far more than any roadblocks they may encounter. Education allows girls to make informed decisions about their lives and allows them to contribute to and help improve society. Michelle was dead on when she said: We need to get these girls into school, because we know that education is the single-most important stepping stone to power, to freedom, and to equality.

 Trump Won’t Give Sean Spicer The Boot Because ‘That Guy Gets Great Ratings’,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer is a trainwreck. After all, this is the guy who said Hitler really wasn t that bad. Everybody tunes in daily to see what ridiculous assertion will come out of his mouth this time, and apparently, that is all the job security he needs in Donald Trump s administration.According to the Washington Post, Trump has no intention of firing Spicer because he  gets great ratings,  and in Trump s White House, ratings matter far more than facts. The WaPo article explores Trump s obsession with cable news and revealed that Spicer s job is safe as long as he can keep people turning in to watch him crash and burn. I m not firing Sean Spicer,  Trump said, according to sources.  That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in. The Washington Post reports that  most of the televisions in the West Wing display four channels at all times  CNN, Fox, Fox Business and MSNBC.  The article also noted that  during an intimate lunch recently with a key outside ally in a small West Wing dining room, for instance, Trump repeatedly paused the conversation to make the group watch a particularly combative Spicer briefing. Spicer has become a laughing stock. Saturday Night Live has had a blast lampooning him in recent months, with Melissa McCarthy playing the role of the press secretary. The fact that Spicer was portrayed on SNL by a woman seemed to be more upsetting to Trump than any of Spicer s numerous gaffes.The press secretary kicked off his very first press conference by claiming that Trump s inauguration really didn t have a pathetic turnout, despite pictures proving he was full of it. And things have only gone downhill from there. But as long as America keeps tuning in for Spicer s daily dumpster fires press briefings, he can rest assured that Trump is going to keep him around.

Trump calls for trade deals with individual countries,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday he favored the United States reaching trade agreements with individual countries as opposed to multilateral accords like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump, who is leading in the race for the Republican nomination for president, has made his opposition to trade deals like the 12-nation TPP and the North American Free Trade Agreement a centerpiece of his campaign toward the Nov. 8 vote. “To do these deals where they wrap them up and they put 12 countries in one. TPP is an example. I want individual trade deals with individual countries,” Trump told a Palm Beach, Florida, news conference ahead of the state’s nominating contest on Tuesday. “Some countries treat us better than others. Some are worse,” he said. “China will take advantage of TPP. It’s not in it now but believe me they come through the back door. They are watching it so closely,” said Trump, a real estate developer. The deal was reached in October.

Putin Tells Obama and Western Media: “Either stop talking about it or finally show some kind of proof”,"21st Century Wire says It appears that Putin has had enough with being accused of tampering with the US election process this year. The Russian President s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, pointed out that it was  indecent  of the US to accuse Russia of tampering with its election.   Remember: On Thursday evening CNN reported that Barack Obama vowed to retaliate against Russia for the  hack  that has not been verified by any independent sources nor has it provided a shred of evidence to support the claim   Tyler Durden Zero HedgePutin has had enough of the relentless barrage of US accusations that he, personally,  hacked the US presidential election. The Russian president s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that the US must either stop accusing Russia of meddling in its elections or prove it. Peskov said it was  indecent  of the United States to  groundlessly  accuse Russia of intervention in its elections. You need to either stop talking about it, or finally show some kind of proof. Otherwise it just looks very indecent , Peskov told Reporters in Tokyo where Putin is meeting with Japan PM Abe, responding to the latest accusations that Russia was responsible for hacker attacks.Peskov also warned that Obama s threat to  retaliate  to the alleged Russian hack is  against both American and international law , hinting at open-ended escalation should Obama take the podium today at 2:15pm to officially launch cyberwar against Russia.Previously, on Thursday, Peskov told the AP the report was  laughable nonsense , while Russian foreign ministry spox Maria Zakharova accused  Western media  of being a  shill  and a  mouthpiece of various power groups , and added that  it s not the general public who s being manipulated,  Zakharova said.  the general public nowadays can distinguish the truth. It s the mass media that is manipulating themselves. Meanwhile, on Friday Sergei Lavrov, Russia s foreign minister told state television network, Russia 24, he was  dumbstruck  by the NBC report which alleges that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in an election hack.The report cited U.S. intelligence officials that now believe with a  high level of confidence  that Putin became personally involved in a secret campaign to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.  I think this is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is absolutely obvious,  Lavrov added, according to the news outlet.As a reminder, last night Obama vowed retaliatory action against Russia for its meddling in the US presidential election last month.   I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing,  Obama told National Public Radio.US intelligence agencies in October pinned blame on Russia for election-related hacking. At the time, the White House vowed a  proportional response  to the cyberactivity, though declined to preview what that response might entail. Meanwhile, both President-elect Donald Trump, the FBI,and the ODNI have dismissed the CIA s intelligence community s assessment, for the the same reason Putin finally lashed out at Obama: there is no proof.That, however, has never stopped the US from escalating a geopolitical conflict to the point of war, or beyond, so pay close attention to what Obama says this afternoon.According to an NBC report, a team of analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Friday that they believe the outgoing administration is likely to take action which could result in a significant barrier for Trump s team once he takes office in January. It is unlikely that U.S. intelligence reports will change Trump s intention to initiate a rapprochement with Moscow, but the congressional response following its own investigations could obstruct the new administration s effort,  Eurasia Group analysts added.Continue the story at Zero HedgeREAD MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch Files",US_News,"December 17, 2016",0,4142
" BREAKING: Republican Governor Arrested On Multiple Charges, GOP In CHAOS","It s the end of Alabama Governor Robert Bentley s political career after he was arrested Monday on charges related to the numerous things he did to cover up an affair. The governor was booked into Montgomery County Jail on two charges related to his failure to disclose campaign information and submitted a letter of resignation shortly afterward.The scandal began to make its way to the public when Bentley fired the head of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, Spencer Collier, who later revealed that he had investigated and seen evidence of an affair between the 74-year-old Bentley and his campaign spokeswoman, Rebekah Mason. This is of course odd given Bentley s opposition to gay marriage on the  one man one woman  basis, but having an affair is not illegal. Unfortunately for him, the rest of the stuff he did is. A press release from the Alabama Ethics Commission details the rest:Today, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause to believe that Governor Robert Bentley committed violations of both the Alabama Ethics Act and the Fair Campaign Practices Act. We have referred those matters to the Montgomery County District Attorney for further consideration and possible prosecution.Intentional violations of the Alabama Ethics Act and the Fair Campaign Practices Act are Class B felonies. The range of punishment for a Class B felony is a prison sentence of between 2 and 20 years per violation, and a fine of up to $20,000.00, per violation. As these matters are still ongoing, the Commission is prohibited by law from any further comment regarding any of the evidence produced or presented in this case.Over the course of this year-long investigation, the Alabama Ethics Commission issued more subpoenas than have been issued by the Commission since it was given subpoena power. Chief Special Agent Tony Goubil and Special Agent Dustin Lansford devoted countless hours in conducting this investigation. They interviewed over 45 witnesses and have analyzed over 33,000 documents in the course of their investigation. The staff of the Commission has worked tirelessly and thoroughly to investigate every Complaint that we received. The evidence was reviewed and tested multiple times by career lawyers. These lawyers include Hugh Evans our General Counsel who has devoted his career to Ethics, as well as our new Assistant General Counsel, Cynthia Propst Raulston, a career prosecutor whose experience includes analyzing and successfully trying complex white collar and public corruption cases to conclusion before juries. Our Commissioners, who include two retired Circuit Judges, two career attorneys and a doctor, all of whom have vast experience sifting through evidence, judging the testimony of witnesses and applying difficult principles in a fair, even-handed manner, ultimately weighed the evidence and returned this finding.Justice (if you can call it that) moved swiftly after his arrest. Bentley copped a plea and was fined $2,000 and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. He also agreed not to run for office again..@GovernorBentley:  I have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabama s governor   FTR #ForTheRecord @MSNBC https://t.co/AMmmRIrxBF  Greta Van Susteren (@greta) April 10, 2017This, as strange as it sounds, should strike fear in the heart of Donald Trump. As a man who regularly bullies anyone who criticizes him or correctly states inconvenient facts and as someone who has a history of firing people who were investigating him or those close to him, Bentley s arrest should be a clear message that no matter how much you abuse your power to cover up something   in Trump s case his campaign s collusion with a hostile foreign dictator   the American people won t let you get away with it.Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 10, 2017",0,3860
"BOOM! TED CRUZ, DESANTIS PUSH For Term Limits: “It is well past time to put an end to the cronyism and deceit…”","We are supposed to have a government of the people, by the people and for the people, but instead we have a government of the elite, by the elite and for the elite. Most people do not realize this, but today most members of Congress are actually millionaires. The disconnect between members of Congress and average Americans has never been greater than it is right now, and I think that is a very troubling sign for the future of this nation.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) are pushing for an amendment to the Constitution to place term limits on lawmakers, arguing the move will help overhaul Washington. The American people resoundingly agreed on Election Day, and President-elect Donald Trump has committed to putting government back to work for the American people,  Cruz said in a statement on Tuesday.  It is well past time to put an end to the cronyism and deceit that has transformed Washington into a graveyard of good intentions.

District of Columbia approves $15/hour minimum wage,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The District of Columbia’s city council approved a $15-an-hour minimum wage on Tuesday, a rate adopted by a growing number of U.S. cities and states seeking to battle income inequality. The council voted unanimously to pass the measure boosting the minimum hourly wage to $15 by 2020, with subsequent hikes tied to inflation. A final vote will come later this month, and Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has backed the bill. Once approved, the U.S. capital will join California and New York in making $15 the hourly minimum. At least eight cities, including Seattle, have also approved the $15 base. “Raising the minimum wage will help address the issues of  residents being pushed out of the District due to rising costs of living and income inequality,” Council member Vincent Orange, a sponsor of the bill, said in the hearing. He and other supporters say Washington’s robust economy and growing population mean it can support a higher minimum wage.  The District of Columbia’s base wage is $10.50, and will go up by $1 on July 1 under existing law. The federal minimum is $7.25 an hour. The $15 minimum is estimated to raise wages for 114,000 workers, or about 14 percent of the District of Columbia’s workforce, according to an analysis for the council by the non-profit Economic Policy Institute. The higher pay proposal was supported by unions but was opposed by the District’s Chamber of Commerce. It said the District should not raise wages until neighboring suburbs do. The District of Columbia’s booming restaurant industry also opposed it. Restaurant owners and the local restaurant association said that higher costs would lead to layoffs. Some lawmakers said the measure did not go far enough to address a widening income gap and 18 percent poverty rate. Council member David Grosso added an amendment requiring the government to study a minimum income system to help the poorest residents. “Raising the minimum wage is a good thing, but is $15 enough? Or should the number be $35, or $50 an hour?” he asked. Under the measure, the minimum for workers who get tips, like waiters and bartenders, would also be $15 an hour by 2020. Following talks with unions, restaurateurs and community activists, employers would have to make up the difference between a base for tipped workers that will be $5 an hour in 2020, up from the current $2.77, Orange said.

U.N. calls on social media giants to control platforms used to lure African migrants,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. migration agency called on social media giants on Friday to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure West African migrants to Libya where they can face detention, torture, slavery or death. The smugglers often use Facebook to reach would-be migrants with false promises of jobs in Europe, International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Leonard Doyle said. When migrants are tortured, video is also sometimes sent back to their families over WhatsApp, as a means of extortion, he said.  We really ... ask social media companies to step up and behave in a responsible way when people are being lured to deaths, to their torture,  Doyle told a Geneva news briefing. There were no immediate replies from Facebook or WhatsApp to requests by Reuters for comment. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe since 2014 and 3,091 have died en route this year alone, many after passing through Libya. This year, the number of migrants entering Europe is 165,000, about 100,000 fewer than all of last year, but the influx has presented a political problem for European countries. IOM has been in discussions with social media providers about its concerns, Doyle said, adding:  And so far to very little effect. What they say is  please tell us the pages and we will shut them down .  It is not our job to police Facebook s pages. Facebook should police its own pages,  he said. Africa represents a big and expanding market for social media but many people are unemployed and vulnerable, he said.  Facebook is pushing out, seeking market share across West Africa and pushing out so-called free basics, which allows ... a  dumb phone  to get access to Facebook. So you are one click from the smuggler, one click from the lies,  he said. Social media companies are  giving a turbo-charged communications channel to criminals, to smugglers, to traffickers, to exploiters , he added. Images broadcast by CNN last month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by Libyan traffickers. This sparked anger in Europe and Africa and highlighted the risks migrants face. Doyle called for social media companies to invest in civic-minded media outreach and noted that on Google, pop-up windows appear if a user is looking at pornography images, to warn of danger or criminality. The IOM has helped 13,000 migrants to return voluntarily to Nigeria, Guinea and other countries from Libya this year. It  provides them with transport and pocket money and documents their often harrowing testimonies.  Doyle said it was currently repatriating 4,000 migrants to Niger. Switzerland said on Friday it was willing to take in up to 80 refugees in Libya in need of protection, among 5,000 whom the UN refugee agency says are in a precarious position.

New Zealand calls in navy to beat jet fuel shortage before vote,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand navy vessel will ferry diesel fuel around the country as the government rushes to alleviate a days-long fuel shortage that has cast air travel into disarray in the run-up to Saturday s national election. The ship would transport up to 4.8 million liters of diesel - equivalent to 150 tankers - to enable industry to focus on providing jet fuel to crisis-hit Auckland airport, Energy and Resources Minister Judith Collins said on Thursday. More than 120 flights have been canceled in New Zealand s largest city this week, disrupting thousands of travelers each day after damage to the single privately owned pipeline that carries jet fuel from a refinery to the city s airport.  The government will continue to do everything it can to support industry efforts to address the disruption,  Collins said in statement. New Zealand s government and industry have taken a series of measures to try to contain the crisis, from fuel rationing to calling on the military to help truck in supplies of fuel, and have set up an industry government group to handle the fallout. Another 14 flights were canceled on Thursday, according to Auckland Airport, but that was less than half the number of flights canceled on Wednesday.   Generally what we are seeing is the cancellations across the industry have stabilized,  said Justin Tighe-Umbers, executive director of the Board of Airline Representatives New Zealand. The ordeal has become a headache for the ruling National Party which is battling it out with the newly invigorated  Labour Party to form the next government. The latest poll showed National with a near 10 point lead over Labour, but polls have been volatile and at times have shown Labour with a comfortable winning margin. Jacinda Ardern, which has almost single-handedly boosted Labour s chances since taking over the leadership in August, has criticized the government for not having taken measures to avoid the kind of infrastructure failure that led to the disruptive fuel shortage. Overnight, Australia s Qantas Airways operated two flights from Australia, nicknamed  fuel mules , carrying fuel to top up Jetstar and Qantas aircraft in Auckland, the airline said.  One was a scheduled A330 passenger service that carried an extra 10,000 kilograms of fuel, while the other was a special 747 flight with 65,000 kilograms of fuel aboard, it said.

12 MUSLIM MIGRANTS GANG RAPE 13 YR OLD GIRL…Muslim Lawyer Blames Girl,"Tell us again Barack, about the  poor widows and orphans  who are being strategically placed in our small towns and communities across America. With all the rape and violence being committed by these  refugees,  why in the world would we welcome these savage animals into our country? Oh that s right to vote for Democrats A Muslim councilor has admitted that some feel as though  it takes two to tango  as 12 men were jailed for gang-raping a 13-year-old white girl in West Yorkshire.The gang of men from Pakistani origin were jailed for a total of 143 years at Bradford Crown Court today, for 13 months of horrendous abuse of the British white girl in 2011 and 2012. However, the Councillor for Keighley Central, where the abuse took place, has admitted that some members of the community felt  it takes two to tango  and that the girl may have  played her part .Zafar Ali, who has been a member of the Keighley Mosque for decades believes that some of the men may have attended in the past, but said the Muslim community totally condemn their actions.He told MailOnline:  Everyone now believes that justice has been done, we need to move forward and it is a lesson for the whole Muslim community. There are a few bad apples but this does not represent the Muslim community as a whole and any sensible Muslim totally condemns these actions. Eleven of the men were today jailed for rape and a twelfth man was jailed for sexual activity with a child under 16 today at Bradford Crown Court, but the ringleader has fled to Bangladesh.West Yorkshire Police confirmed that the men jailed were of Pakistani origin.The sentences come as it emerged that:Ringleader Ahmed Al-Choudhury who facilitated most of the offences is believed to now be living in Bangladesh after fleeing at the beginning of the investigation in 2012 After the sentencing, Kris Hopkins, Conservative MP for Keighley spoke out against the  sick model of organized groups of  Asian men  grooming young white girls , but said there are more women out there who need justice.He said the sentenced were vindication for controversial comments he made during a parliamentary debate in 2012, claiming that organised groups of Asian men were  going around raping white girls .However, he claims that even today he has been  lambasted  for even mentioning that the men are Asian when talking about the sentences.He told MailOnline:  There are sexual offenders who are white, but the fact is this particular model is all  Asian men  and all the victims were white. I was attacked in 2012 and today, when these men were convicted, the community was silent. You have to ask yourself why these men get away with this behavior. There is broader issues around the way women are treated in that community, there are hundreds if not thousands of women who live behind that door and have no voice. In a Commons speech three years ago, Mr Hopkins caused controversy three years ago when he suggested Muslim men were  fundamentally  sexist towards women.Judge Roger Thomas QC condemned the  insolent and disrespectful behaviour  the accused showed in court which he said reflected their treatment of their victim.They showed her no shred of decency or humanity when as a vulnerable child she so needed care and understandingJudge Roger Thomas QC told them:  The attitudes of the majority of you have so clearly demonstrated to these proceedings has been contemptuous, disrespectful and arrogant on a scale that I have hardly seen before in many years of practice in criminal law.  Exactly the same attitude to the 13/14 year old girl who you all sexually abused and exploited for your own selfish gratification. He added:  None of these defendants had any concern for the victim. They were totally uninterested in her welfare and what damage they were causing her. The victim clearly demanded pity and understanding but their view of her was heartless and demeaning. They saw her as a pathetic figure who had no worth and who served no purpose than to be an object that they could sexually misuse and cast aside. Via: Daily Mail ",politics,"Feb 9, 2016",0,4143

 ‘Daily Show’ DESTROYS Transphobic Republicans For Their Ridiculous Bathroom Bills (VIDEO),"On Wednesday night, Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams took on the absolutely ridiculous  bathroom bills  that GOP lawmakers have made their focus in their quest to harass and discriminate against the LGBT community. It seems that the more visibility that the transgender community gets, the more energy Republican legislators put into proposing anti-transgender bills to police what bathrooms they can and can t use.To try to understand exactly why this is, Williams spoke to several trans people and one of their biggest opponents, Chaplain and state Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt (R-CO). Williams confronted the transphobic lawmaker about his belief that transgender people are merely  confused,  and completely destroyed him. In expressing his asinine and twisted religious beliefs, Klingenschmitt told Williams just why transgender people were such a threat to the rest of the country: They not only want to be confused about their own identity, but they want the rest of us to be confused with them. Now they want the government to join them on that pretense? They re making us into liars. Interesting   because when Williams actually asked trans people what they wanted, all they said was respect. They weren t trying to  confuse  or trick anyone about their identity, and insisted that their gender identity was not actually a choice (research can confirm this).Klingenschmitt wanted to go more into the discussion of religion, but insisted on changing first. He said: I would be comfortable talking about religious freedom, but I have to change into my alter ego. Williams waited for him  to transition so he would feel more comfortable during our interview,  while Klingenschmitt remained completely clueless to how ironic the situation had become.When Williams questioned Klingenschmitt about why he was so passionate about passing transphobic legislation, he replied: I mean, that is perversion. It s people who label themselves as transgender for the purpose of getting that access to violate the rights of others. Williams then targeted his role as a chaplain and asked him,  Is it fair to say that if you re a priest you re a pedophile?  Klingenschmitt said no, and Williams asked him why. He replied: Because some people are criminals, and some people are not criminals. Klingenschmitt then said he was unable to apply that same logic to the trans community because  they re apples and oranges. Williams was able to gather that Klingenschmitt s concern was that policies allowing trans women to use bathrooms that match their gender identity would result in sexual assault   even though there have literally been NO reported instances where sexual assault has happened as a result of this.You can watch her dismantle the GOP s anti-trans panic below:The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video Archive Featured image via screen capture",News,"April 7, 2016",0,3020

BOMB THREAT AND CRITICISM HITS HISPANIC BBQ OWNER’S PLANS FOR WHITE APPRECIATION DAY,"In the initial interview with the owner of this BBQ restaurant it was clear that this guy had good intentions. His intent was that we re all Americans and that we have special months and days for others but not one thing for whites. Could be that people might think he s doing this for the publicity but if that s the case, he got more than he bargained for DENVER The Hispanic restaurant owners who ignited an uproar over their plans to hold White Appreciation Day next month were forced to evacuate their barbecue joint late Friday after a bomb scare.Co-owner Edgar Antillon said Rubbin  Buttz BBQ in Milliken, Colorado, was shut down for several hours during the dinner rush after a bomb threat in posts on social media, but he later said that the eatery plans to reopen Saturday.Shortly before the evacuation, Mr. Antillon told the Washington Times that he has received numerous threats and criticism over the restaurant s plan to hold White Appreciation Day on June 11. Mr. Antillon and Miguel Jiminez bought the restaurant last month. It s been phone calls, it s been emails, it s been on social media,  said Mr. Antillon.  Some are just,  Hey, you re an idiot,  and others have been legit threats. The former owners of this establishment are receiving threats even though they have nothing to do with this thing. It s unfortunate. He announced Thursday on Twitter that white customers would receive 10 percent off their tab on White Appreciation Day, but he emphasized Friday that the discount would apply to all patrons, regardless of their race. It s like we ve said many times before, if a black person comes in here and says,  Hey, what about my discount,  they re going to get a discount,  Mr. Antillon said.  If a Mexican comes in here and says,  I want a discount,  they re going to get a discount. Nobody s going to be turned down for anything. Read more: WT",left-news,"May 9, 2015",0,1957

German ex-rightist jailed for plotting Islamist attack on police,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court sentenced a 27-year-old German supporter of Islamic State to three years and three months in prison on Monday for plotting to lure police or soldiers into a trap and kill them with a home-made bomb. The ruling came with German authorities on high alert ahead of Tuesday s anniversary of an attack last year in which a failed Tunisian asylum-seeker plowed a truck into crowds at an outdoor Christmas market and killed 12 people. Prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as Sascha L., had carried out two successful tests of a home-made explosive device in his hometown in January.  An inquiry found two videos of the accused pledging allegiance to Islamic State s leader. However, the court ruled on Monday that there was no evidence that the man had a personal connection with the Islamist militia or that he was financially supported by the militia, German broadcaster NDR reported. NDR said the court granted him leniency since he cooperated with authorities after his arrest and confessed his plans.  German magazine Der Spiegel had reported that the man was part of the far-right scene in the past before converting to Salafism, an ultra-conservative Islamist creed. The man, who was arrested in February, admitted planning an attack. Chemicals that could be used to make explosive devices were found during a search of his home in the town of Northeim in central Germany. Three men charged as accomplices of the convicted man also appeared before the court. Two were convicted, with one sentenced to three years probation and the other to 100 hours of community service. The third person was acquitted.  Last week, German police raided nine locations in Berlin and the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt in an investigation of four people suspected of planning an Islamist-motivated attack.

"Hopes dimming under rubble, Mexico woman's texts help save her","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Trapped under tons of rubble and in complete darkness, Diana Pacheco s hopes were fading fast for making it out alive from a collapsed office building after a huge earthquake in Mexico City, despite rescuers  frantic attempts to reach her. Then the trapped woman had a great stroke of luck: a series of short messages she had written and sent to her husband some 16 hours earlier lit up his phone screen.  My love   The ceiling fell   We re trapped   I love you   I love you a lot   We re on the fourth floor   Near the emergency stairway   There s four of us,  read the WhatsApp messages, which finally reached her husband Juan Jesus Garcia on Wednesday at 5:34 a.m.  Garcia, 33, an Uber driver, had been waiting, often in tears, beside the collapsed building all night and immediately ran over to rescue workers.  It was like a miracle because I was the only one who got the message and since I was there with the rescue workers I talked to them and they could locate her,  said Garcia. The messages on Garcia s phone, seen by Reuters shortly after they were received on Wednesday, could have been delayed due to erratic cell phone coverage in parts of Mexico City after the quake, or the fact that Pacheco s phone signal was blocked by the tons of concrete that kept her trapped in the collapsed building. When asked whether WhatsApp messages can be delivered hours after they were sent in an area without good cellphone coverage, a spokeswoman for the company confirmed it is possible.         Pacheco, a recruiter for a human resources and accounting firm, said she sent the messages shortly after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck at 1:14 p.m. on Tuesday.  Those messages helped them know more or less where we were located,  Pacheco said on Friday from her hospital bed, her voice weak. Using the information to pinpoint their location, rescuers freed Pacheco, 30, and the three other survivors shortly after 6 a.m. on Wednesday.  Rescue operations were still underway on Friday at the building, where Pacheco says there were some 60 people on her floor alone at the time of the quake.  I think there are people (alive) there because we had oxygen, air was coming in,  she said. Despite having bruises all over her body and wearing a neck brace, Pacheco was generally in good health. She said she tried to send WhatsApp and text messages to other people from under the building, as well as make phone calls and post on Facebook, but only the messages to her husband got through.     She said when the building fell, the force of two floors above collapsing violently knocked her down, but a wall of concrete stopped just short of crushing her and three of her coworkers. They found themselves huddled together in a cramped space. They screamed out every time they heard voices from outside the building.  We heard them (rescue workers) when they asked us to yell or make noise, but regardless of how much we yelled they couldn t hear us,  Pacheco said.     The quake, Mexico s deadliest in a generation, has already claimed close to 300 lives. [nL5N1M330H] (This version of the story has been refiled to change the date in dateline.)

U.S. tax avoidance clampdown a potential headache for Apple,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc and other U.S. multinationals will face new curbs on tax loopholes under a rule imposed by Washington on Thursday, part of a scramble among governments worldwide to bolster their corporate tax bases. Acting shortly after a European Union grab for billions of dollars in back taxes from Apple, the U.S. Treasury said it was tightening restrictions on companies’ use of foreign tax credits to reduce what they owe in U.S. taxes. “We are closing another tax loophole that contributes to the erosion of our tax base,” Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur said in a statement.  The fight for multinational tax revenues escalated on Aug. 30 when the EU ruled Ireland was giving improper state aid to Apple in the form of a deal for low taxes. The EU ordered Apple to pay Ireland 13 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in back taxes, prompting U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to express concern the EU ruling could undermine the U.S. tax base. Analysts have speculated whether Apple would be able to cut its U.S. tax bill by claiming foreign tax credits for its extra tax bill in Ireland.  Under normal circumstances, U.S. companies can reduce the taxes they owe the U.S. government by the value of the tax credits they claim for taxes paid abroad on foreign profits. No U.S. tax is due on those profits until they are brought into the United States, or repatriated. The new rule will prevent companies faced with back tax bills from “splitting,” a strategy that allows companies to bring foreign tax credits into the United States without repatriating the income from which they were derived. Apple had no comment on Treasury’s tax notice. The technology giant is not the only U.S. company in the crosshairs of EU state aid investigations. Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp are under investigation by the EU’s executive arm. The new rule was likely to ratchet up transatlantic tensions over corporate taxes while eliminating one more strategy U.S. companies can use to cushion the blow from increasingly aggressive EU tax collection efforts. The tax notice specifically cited European Union state aid investigations as a risk to U.S. revenues. The Treasury had no comment on whether its notice would have an impact on Apple directly, but a spokesperson said the notice applies to all companies required by a foreign government to pay additional taxes, including those hit by state-aid cases.

"Trump weighs revised travel ban, Supreme Court test still possible","PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is considering issuing a new executive order banning citizens of certain countries traveling to the United States after his initial attempt to clamp down on immigration and refugees snarled to a halt amid political and judicial chaos. Trump announced the possibility of a “brand new order” that could be issued as soon as Monday or Tuesday, in a surprise talk with reporters aboard Air Force One late on Friday, as he and the Japanese premier headed to his estate in Florida for the weekend.  His signaling of a possible new tack came a day after an appeals court in San Francisco upheld a court ruling last week that temporarily suspended Trump’s original Jan. 27 executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.  Trump gave no details of any new ban he is considering. He might rewrite the original order to explicitly exclude green card holders, or permanent residents, said a congressional aide familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified. Doing that could alleviate some concerns expressed by the courts. A new order, however, could allow Trump’s critics to declare victory by arguing he was forced to change course in his first major policy as president. Whether or not Trump issues a new order, his administration may still  pursue its case in the courts over the original order, which is still being reviewed by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told reporters late on Friday that taking the case to the Supreme Court remained a possibility, after another White House official said earlier in the day the administration was not planning to escalate the dispute. “Every single court option is on the table, including an appeal of the Ninth Circuit decision on the TRO (temporary restraining order) to the Supreme Court, including fighting out this case on the merits,” Priebus said. “And, in addition to that, we’re pursuing executive orders right now that we expect to be enacted soon that will further protect Americans from terrorism.” Trump’s original order, which he called a national security measure meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The abrupt implementation of the order plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from targeted countries, Western allies and some of America’s leading corporations, especially technology firms. A federal judge in Seattle suspended the order last Friday after its legality was challenged by Washington state, eliciting a barrage of angry Twitter messages from Trump against the judge and the court system. That ruling was upheld by an appeals court in San Francisco on Thursday, raising questions about Trump’s next step. An official familiar with Trump’s plans said if the order is rewritten, among those involved would likely be White House aide Stephen Miller, who was involved in drafting the original order, as well as officials of the National Security Council, Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security. It is not clear if a new order from Trump would immediately put a travel ban back in place, or if those who have filed lawsuits, including the state of Washington, would succeed in asking the same judge for another hold. Should Trump issue a new order, he is still likely to face legal challenges, as opponents could ask the court to let them amend their complaints, said Alexander Reinert, a professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York.  On Air Force One, Trump addressed the San Francisco court fight, saying: “We will win that battle. The unfortunate part is that it takes time statutorily... We need speed for reasons of security.” The matter could move forward next week. An unidentified judge on the 9th Circuit on Friday requested that the court’s 25 full-time judges vote on whether the temporary block of Trump’s travel ban should be reheard before an 11-judge panel, known as en banc review, according to a court order. The 9th Circuit asked both sides to file briefs by Thursday.      In a separate case on Friday, Justice Department lawyers argued in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia against a preliminary injunction that would put a longer hold on Trump’s executive order than the Seattle court ruling, but focused solely on visa holders. Judge Leonie Brinkema asked the administration for more evidence of the threat posed by citizens of the seven countries. Aboard the flight with Trump were his wife Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie. The Trumps landed in the evening and went to their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2017 ",1,4953

Lawyer for detained Myanmar journalists denied access in Bangladesh,"DHAKA (Reuters) - A lawyer for two Myanmar journalists detained in Bangladesh while reporting on the influx of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar said on Monday he had been denied access to them amid concern over their well-being.  The journalists, Minzayar Oo and Hkun Lat, were detained more than a week ago in the Cox s Bazar border district in Bangladesh, where refugees are arriving from Myanmar to escape a military offensive against insurgents that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing. Bangladesh police said the pair were detained for engaging in journalistic work for a German magazine while on tourist visas. On Thursday, a court refused them bail. Jyotirmoy Barua, their lawyer, said he had gone to the prison to meet them about a petition he planned to file in a higher court seeking their release.  But prison authorities refused him permission and did not say why, he said, adding that he had asked for court and police documents to prepare an appeal on behalf of the two. Myanmar has said it is seeking information about the two through diplomatic channels. More than 410,000 refugees from Myanmar have poured into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts triggered a Myanmar army operation in response. Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying its forces are conducting a legitimate campaign against terrorists. Germany s GEO magazine, which had assigned Minzayar Oo to cover the Rohingya crisis, said he had traveled to Bangladesh on Sept. 6, along with Hkun Lat, and was detained the next day.  We are very concerned that the lawyer is being denied access,  Christoph Kucklick, editor-in-chief of GEO, said in a joint statement with Adrian Evans, director of Panos Pictures, of which Minzayar Oo is a member.  Even more disconcerting is that the authorities are stating that Minzayar Oo and Hkun Lat were detained on September 13   whereas in reality they have been in police custody since September 7,  the magazine said.  We need to know that they are well treated and physically unharmed.  Minzayar Oo is one of Myanmar s most prominent photographers and has worked for various media outlets, covering the country s emergence from military rule.  Hkun Lat is also a well-known photographer in Myanmar and has won prizes for his coverage of conflict in frontier regions. ",worldnews,"September 18, 2017 ",1,2420
 Bernie HILARIOUSLY Trolls Paul Ryan On Twitter – All While Helping Down-Ballot Dems (TWEET),"Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is in full campaign mode, and it shows. He s also having a high old time trolling House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is under a seemingly crippling amount of stress due to his own party s buffoonish nominee, Donald Trump.Earlier in the week, Ryan spoke to a group of young Republicans in his home state of Wisconsin, and had dire warnings regarding what could happen if Democrats take back the Senate: that their worst nightmare would come true, and Bernie would be heading up the Budget Committee. Ryan said to the University of Wisconsin students: If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee? A guy named Bernie Sanders. You ever heard of him? Ryan s remarks were not missed by Bernie. He tweeted: I heard what @SpeakerRyan said: If the GOP loses the Senate, I ll be the Budget chairman. Sounds like a good idea.

"Divided on Trump, EU insists on European unity","VALLETTA (Reuters) - European Union leaders said they agreed to stick together in dealing with Donald Trump, but at their first summit since he took office they were at odds on how far to confront or engage with the new U.S. president. Trump and his policies, from questioning the value of NATO and free trade to banning Muslim refugees, came up repeatedly in discussions in Malta on external “challenges” facing the Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May, about to lead her country out of the EU, briefed peers on her visit to Washington last week and assured them Trump was committed to cooperating in their defense — just as Britain would also be after Brexit. Francois Hollande, the outgoing Socialist president of France, led criticism of Trump, calling it “unacceptable” for him to applaud Brexit and forecast the break-up of the EU. In thinly veiled rebukes to May and some eastern states, he warned of trying to cut their own transatlantic deals. “A lot of countries should think of their future first of all in the European Union rather than imagining I don’t what kind of bilateral relationship with the United States,” he said. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, who like many in the east is alarmed by Trump’s conciliatory noises to Moscow, poured cold water on May’s suggestion Britain could be a link to Washington. Europe did not need a “bridge”, she was quoted as saying, because it could communicate with Trump on Twitter. But her Polish neighbor, Beata Szydlo, reserved her main  criticisms for her predecessor as prime minister, EU summit chair Donald Tusk, who described Trump this week as a “threat” to the EU, along with Russia, China and militant Islam.  “European politicians trying to build this sense of fear ... are making a mistake,” said Szydlo, whose government, like Trump, has spoken out against Muslim immigration. “One cannot be confrontational in our relations with the United States.” Stressing the need for unity, the bloc’s dominant leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Europeans still had common ground with the United States in many areas, while not sharing Trump’s scepticism about many international institutions. “We have again made very clear our common values and our faith in multilateralism,” she told a news conference.  The Union would, she said, push for free trade deals with more nations as Trump pulls back. But cooperation with the United States against militant threats would continue, she said. One EU diplomat said France was clearly pushing to use the Trump presidency to rally Europeans behind a policy of greater distance from Washington and turning to the EU, rather than NATO, for their security.  “The Germans are much more cautious,” the diplomat said. “There is a clear issue to be decided: whether we seek common ground to engage with the United States, or turn our backs.” Summit host Joseph Muscat, the Maltese prime minister, chose to emphasize balance in summing up the discussions, speaking of “concern” at Trump’s policy but “no sense of anti-Americanism”. “There was a sense that we need to engage with the U.S. just the same,” Muscat said. “But we need to show that we cannot stay silent where there are principles involved.” ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2017 ",1,3264
British PM May forces her deputy to resign over pornography scandal,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May forced her most senior minister, Damian Green, to resign for lying about whether he knew pornography had been found on computers in his parliamentary office. The resignation of one of May s closest political allies, who had helped pacify her deeply divided party, is a blow as she navigates the final year of tortuous negotiations ahead of Britain s exit from the European Union in March 2019. Green, who voted to stay in the EU, was appointed as first secretary of state just six months ago in a bid to shore up May s premiership following her disastrous bet on a June snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament. But Green s future was thrust into doubt when the Sunday Times newspaper reported last month that police in 2008 had found pornography on his office computers in the Houses of Parliament. In response, Green said the story was untrue. A review, requested by May and conducted by a senior government official, concluded that Green s statements which suggested he was not aware that indecent material had been found  on the computers, were  inaccurate and misleading.  The inquiry, a summary of which was distributed by May s Downing Street office, found he had breached rules governing the behavior of ministers because the police had told him about the indecent material.  I apologize that my statements were misleading on this point,  Green said in a letter to May.  I regret that I ve been asked to resign from the government.  Green, 61, said he did not download or view pornography on his parliamentary computers. He added that he should have been clearer about his statements after the story broke.  May said she had asked him to resign and accepted his resignation with deep regret. He is the most senior British politician to fall since the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal triggered a debate about a culture of abuse by some powerful men at the heart of Westminster. May s defense minister, Michael Fallon, quit last month for unspecified conduct which he said had fallen below required standards. Her aid minister resigned a week later after holding undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials. During the turmoil that followed the botched election, May turned to Green   a university friend from their days at Oxford   to stabilize her premiership and appease those within the Conservative Party who wanted her to quit. One of his key roles was to act as a conduit for disgruntled party members who felt they had been ignored in May s election campaign. He sought to help her to shed the image of a distant leader who only listens to those in her inner circle.  It s another blow for May but it is not deadly in any way at all,  said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King s College London.  She has lost her soulmate in cabinet but this is not the end of Prime Minister May.    May is surviving not because of Damian Green but because there are sufficient MPs in her party who don t want to have a leadership election while Brexit is going on and that fundamental calculation has not changed,  he said. The internal investigation found that Green s conduct as a minister was generally  professional and proper  but found two statements he made on Nov. 4 and 11 to be inaccurate and misleading.  In the statements, Green suggested he was not aware that indecent material had been found on his computers. The inquiry said Green s statements had fallen short of the honesty requirements for those in public life and thus constituted breaches of the ministerial code of conduct. The allegations about pornography were publicly aired by former Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Bob Quick, drawing a rebuke from the head of the London police, Cressida Dick, who said officers had a duty of confidentiality. May, who served as home secretary for six years before winning the top job, said she shared concerns about the comments made by the former police officer. Sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Weinstein have prompted some women and men to share stories about improper behavior at the heart of British political power in Westminster. The internal investigation also addressed allegations, made by the daughter of a family friend, that Green had made an unwanted advance towards her during a social meeting in 2015, had suggested that this might further her career, and later had sent her an inappropriate text message. The report said it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of Green s behavior in that instance, though the investigation found allegations to be plausible. Green said in his resignation letter that he did not recognize the account of events, but apologized to the woman, academic and critic Kate Maltby, for making her feel uncomfortable.

"Despite showman reputation, Trump inauguration shaping up as low-key","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump made his name with opulent hotels and a dramatic reality TV show, but his inauguration on Friday as the 45th U.S. president is shaping up as a more understated affair, with big names in entertainment staying away. Like those who came before him, Trump will take his oath on the steps of the U.S. Capitol building and lead a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, but there will be fewer official balls and  less glitz and celebrity talent to welcome in the new president. Inaugurations have been star-studded affairs since 1941, when President Franklin Roosevelt held a gala with actors Charlie Chaplin, Mickey Rooney and other stars of the era, said Jim Bendat, a historian who has written a book on U.S. inaugurations. But this year, several singers – including Elton John and Charlotte Church – declined invitations to perform at inaugural events. Trump, a New York businessman and former star of “The Apprentice” TV show, won with a populist platform that included promises to build a wall along the Mexican border, restrict immigration from Muslim countries and dismantle Obamacare. Broadway star Jennifer Holliday said yes to performing, but backed down after a backlash from fans.  “You can’t really find precedent for that,” Bendat said in an interview. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, singer Jackie Evancho and the Rockettes dancing troupe are among those slated to perform, although individual Rockettes will be allowed to opt out of performing if they so choose. Trump’s inaugural committee has said it is intentionally avoiding top entertainers. “We’re fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the president-elect,” Tom Barrack, inaugural committee chairman, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York last week. “So what we’ve done, instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers, is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place,” Barrack said. Trump is slated to attend three official galas. Other modern inaugurations have had around 10 official balls, which the president and first lady would attend in rapid succession, typically dancing during each appearance.  Then-President Bill Clinton held a record 14 balls during his 1997 inauguration, Bendat said.  On Thursday, a series of choirs and marching bands will perform at the Lincoln Memorial, followed by a concert featuring country music star Toby Keith.  Trump, who is entering office with unusually low approval ratings, has repeatedly pushed back against reports that his inauguration may be lacking in star power or have low attendance. “People are pouring into Washington in record numbers,” Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday. “Bikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday!”  Officials expect about 800,000 spectators for the events – down from the estimated 1.8 million who flocked to Washington for Obama’s 2009 inauguration. Just 40 percent of Americans said they had a favorable view of Trump versus 55 percent who had an unfavorable view, according to a Gallup poll taken from Jan. 4 to Jan. 8.  At a similar point before he took office in 2009, Obama was viewed favorably by 78 percent of Americans. Before taking office in 2001, President George W. Bush had a 62 percent favorable rating, according to the Gallup data. “What is most likely to distinguish Trump’s inauguration is the number of protesters,” said Brian Balogh, co-host of American history radio show BackStory. The National Parks Service has granted permits to protest for 27 groups. On Saturday, the National Mall will draw what organizers estimate will be about 200,000 people to a Women’s March to protest Trump. The Women’s March, which is expected to be the largest protest, is aimed at bringing attention to human and civil rights issues. Honorary co-chairs of the protest include activist Gloria Steinem and actor Harry Belafonte.  ",politicsNews,"January 17, 2017 ",1,3995
 Jay Carney Let It Slip That He Knows Who Obama Wants As His Successor,"Former White House Press Secretary in the Obama administration Jay Carney is sure he knows who the president wants for his successor: Hillary Clinton. President Obama has yet to hand out any official endorsements during this primary season, but, of course, like all major political players, he has his favorite. Carney is sure that person is Hillary. He said to Brooke Baldwin on CNN: I don t think there is any doubt that he wants Hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he s achieved. I think the President has signaled, while still remaining neutral, that he supports Secretary Clinton s candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee. He won t officially embrace her unless and until it s clear that she s going to be the nominee. I think he is maintaining that tradition of not intervening in a party primary. Smartly, the president is refusing to comment on what Jay Carney has said. However, he s done all but given an official nod to Hillary as the primary race heats up. President Obama will likely give the nod to whomever gets the nomination, as we all want a Democrat in the White House. However, he wants Hillary to be that person. That much is pretty clear.It s hard for anybody to speak for President Obama, of course, but his former Secretary of State seems to be his pick. Hopefully, we find out for sure in short order, but it s pretty smart for a sitting president not to endorse one of his party s candidates over the other while waiting to see who actually gets the nomination, especially in a close, neck-in-neck race. He must be pretty antsy, though, being unable to endorse right away.No worries, Mr. President. The primaries will be over soon, and you can speak your piece then.Featured image via screen capture from Flickr",News,"February 10, 2016",0,1937
HEY “SIMPLETONS”…We’ve Got Great News! The Left Is Going To Help You Identify “Fake News” [VIDEO],"Lauren Southern is one tough reporter. She s not afraid to jump into the middle of the fire in order to get the truth out to Americans who rely on unreliable leftist sources of information like NYT s, The Huffington Post, PBS, The Washington Post,  CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS. She starts out her video sarcastically telling her viewers,  As we know, right-leaning viewers like myself are some of the most gullible people on the planet.  Southern then tells readers not to worry because, Our corporate masters are so kind and helpful, making sure no wrong thing gets through to our little ignorant minds.  She tells viewers not to worry, us half-wits  are in good hands, because social media corporations like Facebook and Google are helping you out by  cracking down on fake news sources  by using leftist sources like Snopes and Politfact to tell you what you should, and should not believe:  I don t know about you, but once I found out about this amazing system, I realized just how lucky I am that now only myself or any other simpletons online will fall for lies ever again.   Sometimes  fake news  doesn t just blow up in the metaphorical sense, where everyone shares it around on social media, but literally as well. In 1993 NBC actually rigged a truck with explosives in order to claim  General Motors vans were likely to catch on fire after crashing. Lauren has a few tips for Americans who are sick and tired of being told which news people should, or should not believe in. Southern starts out her video rant by pointing out how  fortunate  we are to have large corporations who she identifies as our  corporate masters with a liberal bent telling  right-leaning voters like myself, who are some of the most gullible people on the planet what is and isn t  fake news.' Southern warns against trusting that a group of left-leaning social media corporations have your best interests in mind when they hire leftist organizations to tell you what news you should or should not believe. She asks her viewers:  With all of the fake news that is floating around, what are we supposed to do? Well, it seems like we have 2 options: The first one is to stop reading the news permanently. We all know the corporate media will lie to you for profit. Google is filtering what we see. Facebook is surpassing stories that have a conservative bent and stops them from trending at all. I personally prefer option 2 where Facebook and Google and whoever else can just stop pretending to be the complete arbiters of truth with their stupid filters and promises of  objectivity  and go let s back to using our own heads to discern what is and is not a real news story, and compare and contrast facts provided by all news sites from all political viewpoints. It s not that hard. So Facebook, Google and all the rest of you who want to control our news, why don t you guys just screw off! By the way, it s not just Facebook and Google that are helping you to decide what you should and shouldn t believe, Twitter and Youtube are joining in to help viewers determine what content that users post on their social media platforms they deem  reliable  or  unreliable.  Behind the curtain, you will likely find hosts from CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC clapping their hands like seals, as this effort to shut down alternate media sources is beginning to effect revenue streams of top conservative sites like Breitbart News. Like a  Scarlett Letter,  advertisers are now using lists provided to them by leftist organizations to determine who they should or should not advertise with. And since there are very few (if any) left-leaning websites on those lists, you may have already guessed it, publications like the NYT s who have been losing huge amounts of ad revenues to alternative news sources that are eating their lunches, will be able to re-pocket those profits once they regain their monopoly on the news.",left-news,"Apr 22, 2017",0,3987
NEW DATA RELEASED: OBAMA ADMIN “Accidentally Collected Info” On Americans During Election,"Did you catch that?  Information accidentally collected I think it is alarming. There seems to be a universal trend toward more surveillance and more surveillance that impacts Americans  privacy without obtaining a warrant  -Lawyer for the ACLU During his final year in office, President Barack Obama s team significantly expanded efforts to search National Security Agency intercepts for information about Americans, distributing thousands of intelligence reports across government with the unredacted names of U.S. residents during the midst of a divisive 2016 presidential election:Barack Obama s top aides routinely took advantage of rules their boss relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats. Dozens of times in 2016, those intelligence reports identified Americans who were directly intercepted talking to foreign sources or were the subject of conversations between two or more monitored foreign figures.The data, made available this week by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, provides the clearest evidence to date of how information accidentally collected by the NSA overseas about Americans was subsequently searched and disseminated after President Obama loosened privacy protections to make such sharing easier in 2011 in the name of national security. A court affirmed his order.The revelations are particularly sensitive since the NSA is legally forbidden from directly spying on Americans and its authority to conduct warrantless searches on foreigners is up for renewal in Congress later this year. And it comes as lawmakers investigate President Trump s own claims his privacy was violated by his predecessor during the 2016 election.Read more: Circa ",Government News,"May 3, 2017",0,1854
Desperation? The Clinton Grifters Go Back On The Campaign Trail,"The World Class Grifters aka The Clintons are going on the road to  campaign. Does anyone else smell desperation?

Just when he thought it was safe to hit the road again, Hillary reminds a new generation of voters why wise and prudent men lock up their wives and daughters when Bubba s in the neighborhoodShe has dispatched Bubba to campaign for her next week in New Hampshire. Bubba knows how to do politics   there s nobody better   and Hillary, who s a whiz at squeezing boodle from contributors with payback on their minds, hasn t a clue. When she occasionally has a good week, she follows the next with a blunder.Bubba has stepped forward in recent days to take over the retail end of the family business, and was looking forward to doing what he does best. But he forgot to put a leash and a muzzle on Hillary, who decided it was a good time to take on Donald Trump. Not a good idea.She was offended by the Donald s coarseness and rudeness, forgetting who was talking. She pretended to be shocked by the Donald s locker-room swagger, and specifically his mockery of her campaign prowess against Barack Obama in 2008.  She was going to beat Obama,  the Donald had told a crowd in Grand Rapids.  She was going to beat   she was favored to win   and she got schlonged. She lost.  It s not clear whether the lady was offended by the reminder of how she squandered that opportunity, or by his use of obscure Yiddish slang for a man s most precious junk.Nevertheless, the first lady who frequently turned the White House air blue with her muleskinner language played the delicate-flower card as defender of women against the Donald and the Republican  war on women.

"Turkey's Erdogan calls on mayors to resign, Hurriyet newspaper says","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has called on mayors of three major cities to resign, including the high-profile mayor of the capital, Ankara, the Hurriyet newspaper reported on Thursday, in a push to revitalize his ruling party ahead of 2019 elections. The comments mark Erdogan s most explicit demand yet for a shake-up of veteran politicians - some of whom are nationally prominent - after voters in many cities rejected an April referendum granting him sweeping power. While Erdogan narrowly won the referendum to change the constitution and create an executive presidency, voters in 17 of Turkey s 30 largest cities voted against the change. Since then, Erdogan has spoken of the need for renewal in local government and the ruling AK Party, citing signs of  metal fatigue  within administrations.  People do not take these offices as independent candidates but as candidates shown by parties. We cannot regard these posts as chairs which are kept eternally and never abandoned,  the Hurriyet quoted him as telling reporters on his plane back from a trip to Poland this week. A request had been conveyed for the resignation of the mayor of Balikesir in northwest Turkey, the newspaper quoted him as saying.  Likewise, this situation was conveyed to (Ankara Mayor) Melih (Gokcek). The same with Bursa,  he was quoted as saying. Bursa is a city in northwest Turkey. The mayor of Istanbul has resigned in the last month, as has the mayor of Duzce city in northwest Turkey. The mayor of Nigde city in central Turkey, resigned on Wednesday.     But Gokcek, who has been Ankara mayor since 1994 and won five consecutive elections, has so far stayed in place, despite widespread speculation that we would step down. Gokcek has avoided addressing the resignation issue and pointedly steered clear of the subject in public when he made an unexpected visit to the presidential palace this month.  I presented to my president all the project details of the museum to be built opposite the (presidential) palace. I also gave various information about ongoing municipal projects... For the public s information,  he wrote on Twitter. Gokcek, generally regarded as a staunch Erdogan loyalist, is well known in Turkey for tweets in which he has engaged in spats with journalists and other senior members of the AKP. In February he suggested the U.S.-based cleric blamed for last year s failed coup might be plotting an earthquake, with the help of foreign powers, to damage the economy.

GREAT! PRO-COAL OKLAHOMA AG Tapped For Head Of EPA," When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing",politics,"Dec 7, 2016",0,1358

South Sudan opposition groups meet in Kenya to 'harmonize voices',"KAMPALA (Reuters) - South Sudanese opposition groups tried to forge a united front on Monday ahead of an expected resumption of peace talks, in the first such meeting since the start of their country s civil war nearly four years ago, attendees told Reuters. South Sudan s civil war, triggered by a feud between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine and forced a third of the population - some four million people - to flee their homes.  Representatives of South Sudan s many armed and unarmed opposition groups met in the Kenyan town of Nyahururu, said Kosti Manibe, a former government minister who was briefly jailed and represents a group of ex-political prisoners.  I call it like-minded groups who are opposed to the policy that the regime of Salva in (South Sudan s capital) Juba is pursuing,  Manibe said.  The gathering, expected to last three days, comes after diplomats from the regional bloc IGAD held talks with Kiir in Juba at the weekend to press the government to participate in the planned peace talks in December.  The opposition is speaking in a cacophony of voices. There is a need to harmonize these voices,  said Majak D Agoot, another member of the former prisoner group. Manibe said Kenya s government had   graciously allowed  the opposition groups to meet in their country, without elaborating. Kenyan foreign affairs ministry spokesman Edwin Limo said he was not aware of the meeting. The United Nations says South Sudan s civil war has resulted in ethnic cleansing and other war crimes. A Western-backed peace deal between Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar collapsed last year, spawning the creation of new armed and political groups opposing the government. Machar s SPLA-IO rebel group, the country s largest which still controls swathes of territory in the south and northeast of South Sudan, declined to attend the Nyahururu meeting, according to Nathaniel Oyet, a senior member of the group, saying it may distract from the December talks.  Oyet also cited security concerns in Kenya where SPLA-IO officials have disappeared in the last year, including Machar s spokesman who was arrested and deported to Juba in 2016. Among those attending Monday s meeting in Kenya were representatives of former army general Thomas Cirillo, who is waging an insurgency in the southern region of South Sudan, and other former government officials Lam Akol, Gabriel Changson, and Joseph Bakosoro, all of whom live in exile. South Sudanese government officials were unavailable for comment on the Kenya meeting. ",worldnews,"October 16, 2017 ",1,2665
 Conservative ‘Christians’ Get Their Asses Handed To Them For Supporting Healthcare Repeal,"A former evangelical Christian is ripping conservatives for repealing the Affordable Care Act.Bruce Horst knows what it is like to have pre-existing conditions while trying to purchase health insurance. Prior to Obamacare, insurance companies refused to cover him, leaving him and his family vulnerable if a health crisis ever arose. But because of Obamacare, people with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health insurance.Obamacare literally saved Horst and his family from the threat of bankruptcy over a medical issue.But last week during a late night vote, Republicans in the Senate and House voted to repeal the healthcare law that covers over 30 million Americans.And conservatives cheered.Well, that didn t sit well with Horst, who despite being an atheist, probably knows the Bible better than most of these so-called evangelical  Christians  do.So Horst took these fake Christians to the woodshed on Facebook for applauding the death sentence Republicans just handed to millions of human beings. I have the simple conviction that it is immoral to give a person medical help according to how much they can pay,  Horst wrote.  Or maybe it s because of what I ve read in the Bible. In 2010 I had been a Conservative Evangelical Christian for all of my adult life. I began to realize that others around me despised the thought of allowing people like me the benefit of affordable health insurance. For some reason, all of the Christians that I knew thought that offering health insurance to people like me would put them at some kind of a disadvantage that they were not willing to accept. Frankly, they had been lied to so they believed those  others  were going to get healthcare and make their own healthcare inadequate.As a Christian, I believed that I would be judged on the Final Judgment Day on how I took care of the  least of these  as described in the Bible book of Matthew, chapter 25. I came to the sober realization that Christians around me had no such convictions. If they didn t believe Jesus  words as recorded in the Bible, why should I? Then one day I discovered I could no longer believe any of it.While conservatives complain that not as many people are attending church anymore, it turns out their hypocrisy and heartlessness is one of the reasons why people such as Horst have stopped believing. Stripping millions of Americans of the healthcare they need just further proved that Horst was right to leave the church when he did.Horst went on to call out Republicans in Congress and blasted how the hypocritical conservatives are when they claim to be  pro-life. I understand that Congress is about to take away the healthcare coverage of about 18 million of our fellow Americans. And they are doing this at the insistence of Conservative Evangelical Christians. I have friends who are alive today because of Obamacare. Probably all of us do. To me, this proves my Christian friends are not pro-life, but instead they ve been told they are as a matter of manipulation, probably to keep them putting money in the offering plate, or voting for the  right  candidate. One thing is clear to me, they are not really pro-life.I don t know what Congress is going to do with healthcare in the next few days. I would love to be surprised to find that President Trump has convinced Congress to extend healthcare coverage to all, and I would be among the first to be grateful for this. While even if this does occur, if my Christian friends insist that healthcare only be given to people based on their ability to pay for such care, I would have to believe that the Jesus of the Bible would say to them,  depart from me, I never knew you.  Just like He did in Matthew 25.In other words, conservatives are going to hell for condemning millions of Americans to suffer. It s not what Jesus would do and any conservative who says otherwise is only pretending to be a Christian.Featured Image: i.ytimg.com",News,"January 19, 2017",0,4021

Catalan strike severs road links as secessionist leader regroups,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - A general strike called by pro-independence campaigners in Catalonia closed shops and severed transport links on Wednesday, as the region s deposed leader lost political momentum after failing to seal an electoral pact with another party. Protesters closed roads, causing huge tailbacks into Barcelona, while some public transport ran minimum services and some smaller stores remained shuttered. Reuters saw hundreds of strikers gathered in Barcelona s main Sant Jaume square to protest the imprisonment of politicians, chanting the name of ex-leader Carles Puigdemont and referring to him as  our president . But he faces an uphill task to maintain influence after he missed a deadline of midnight on Tuesday to agree a pro-secessionist pact for a regional election with his former vice president Oriol Junqueras. The central government in Madrid called the election for Dec. 21 after last month assuming control of Catalonia following its parliament s unilateral independence declaration. Spain s Constitutional Court on Wednesday officially annulled the declaration, which it had suspended, a widely expected ruling. Catalonia s secessionist push has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, leading to a business exodus and reopened old wounds from the civil war in the 1930s. Junqueras is in custody on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds. But polls show his leftist ERC party will win three times as many seats next month in the regional assembly than the centre-right PDeCAT of Puigdemont, who is in self-imposed exile in Belgium and facing the same charges. If that forecast proves correct  it represents a very uncomfortable position for Puigdemont,  said Jose Miguel de Elias, of political consultancy Sigma Dos.  If (the secessionists) get enough seats to form a government, he would be vice president, which ... would not suit him.  In Catalonia there was a mixed reaction to the pro-independence strike, called by two civic groups, whose heads were imprisoned last month on sedition charges, and a labor union. People stood across dozens of major highways waving placards and chanting  freedom for political prisoners , TV and video images showed, while minor scuffles were reported on social media as police attempted to move protesters. While many smaller stores left their shutters down due the strike, most larger shops and businesses appeared to be open as normal.  Why should I strike, nobody is going to raise my salary... The politicians should work more and stop their silliness,  Jose Luis, a Barcelona construction worker, told Reuters TV on his way to work. Protester Josep Cardona, a 55-year-old office worker, had not joined a previous strike, but this time  with putting people in prison, it has all gone too far,  he said. Strike supporter Nuria Catalana, a 64-year-old nurse, said she had favored a pro-secessionist electoral pact, but understood the difficulties involved.  We ll have to see if they really pay attention to whoever wins the election. We have to continue the struggle,  she said. Puigdemont had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heartland of the European Union.  But that hope has fallen flat, and in an interview published on Wednesday he renewed criticism of the bloc s executive.  (EU Commission President Jean-Claude) Juncker welcomes mayors, governors ... but he doesn t want to meet me,  Puigdemont told Belgian Daily De Standaard.   I ve always been a convinced European ... But the people who are running the EU now are wrecking Europe.  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has been unwavering in his opposition to any form of independence for Catalonia, said he hoped next month s election would usher in  a period of calm  and business as usual for the region.  I m hoping for massive participation ... and, after that, we ll return to normality,  he said in the Madrid parliament building on Wednesday. An opinion poll released on Sunday by Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia showed Junqueras  ERC could garner 45 or 46 seats in the regional assembly and Puigdemont s PdeCat just 14 or 15. That would leave them needing to form a parliamentary alliance with anti-capitalist CUP to reach the 68-seat threshold for a majority. ERC and PDeCAT could still reach an agreement after the vote, but by standing together they could have held more seats, polls and projections from the 2015 election results showed.

 Dr. Drew: Trump And His Supporters Are Mentally Unstable,"Dr. Drew Pinsky knows a thing or two about reality show stars, so it wasn t really that hard for him to question Donald Trump s mental health.The Republican nominee has been going further and further off the deep end since the first day of his campaign last year. His behavior and big mouth have caused many Americans to say that Trump is not fit for public office, especially an office as powerful as the presidency, which has access to the nuclear weapons codes.And according to Dr. Drew, who is a board certified internist and a Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Americans are right to worry.During an interview with Don Lemon on CNN, Dr. Drew explained that he doesn t think Trump is necessarily insane. There s two definitions of sanity, one is legal definition, and that is somebody who is so out of it they don t know the difference between right and wrong. That is a very high standard for insanity, very few people meet that standard. When you re legally insane, you re really not functioning. Clinically, medically, usually when we talk about insanity, we mean psychotic, hearing voices, hallucinations. But he did concede that Trump is showing signs of mental instability. The question, though, is, are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected? That s a pretty hard thing to predict. I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics, or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses? When I hear people that are impulsive with their speech, I worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions. Pinsky then went on to question the mental health of Trump s supporters, who seem to support him no matter what he says or does. What s more fascinating to me, Don, is not him but his supporters that seem to not be concerned about any of this. That, to me, is fascinating. As always, what is up with us? Let s just assume that most people that would choose to be in a very high-profile race like this would have narcissistic tendencies, and there s something called sort of narcissistic injury, then narcissistic rage. If you injure   if you really shame somebody   they tend to be sort of teflon when it comes to shame. If you shame them, they can react with extreme aggression and extreme rage. So this seems to be that kind of a psychological process. Here s the video via VidMe.Donald Trump is a threat to this country. Placing him in a position with such consequential responsibility would be reckless and it would embarrass this nation on the world stage.America needs a president with a temperament and mental stability that will not cause World War III. We need someone who is not thin-skinned or easily provoked. We need someone who think of the people and the country before themselves. That person is NOT Donald Trump.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 2, 2016",0,3030
Obama says Republican campaign rhetoric troubling to outside world,"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday he is hearing from  foreign leaders who are alarmed at Republican presidential candidates’ positions on issues such as climate change and immigration.     “I think foreign observers are troubled by some of the rhetoric that’s been taking place in these Republican primaries and Republican debates,” Obama told reporters at the end of a summit with Southeast Asian leaders. Americans will choose a new president in a Nov. 8 election. Republicans and Democrats are currently battling in nominating contests to determine who will represent their parties in the race for the presidency. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has made headlines for supporting a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and controversial statements about immigrants. But Obama said the concern abroad is not limited to Trump.  “He may up the ante in anti-Muslim sentiment, but if you look at what other Republican candidates have said, that’s pretty troubling too,” Obama added. Noting that other countries rely on the United States to back sound science, Obama also took aim at Republican resistance to strong action on climate change as “troubling to the international community.” Obama reiterated his confidence that ultimately Americans would reject billionaire Trump. Americans realize the next president will have access to the nuclear codes, have the power to send U.S. troops to war and may be tasked with keeping the banking system afloat, Obama said. “They recognize that being president is a serious job. It’s not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. It’s not promotion or marketing,” he said. “The American people are sensible, and I think they will make a sensible choice in the end.”  Trump, a real estate mogul, was host of popular reality TV shows “The Apprentice” and “The Celebrity Apprentice” before making his run for president. Asked about Obama’s comments at a town hall style event in Beaufort, South Carolina, Trump said Obama had done a “lousy job” and would have been a one-term president if he had decided to challenge him in the last election. “This man has done such a bad job and set us back so far and for him to say that actually is a great compliment,” Trump said.

Pakistan's ex-PM appears in court for trial over finances,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif attended an anti-corruption trial on Friday ordered by the country s Supreme Court when it removed him from office earlier this year. Sharif, 67, arrived at the court with his daughter, Maryam, who is also on trial over the family s wealth and financial dealings. The family has called the case a political conspiracy but opposition leaders who pushed it before the courts have hailed it as accountability for the rich and powerful. The charges in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court are linked to London properties the family owns that were revealed in the 2016 Panama Papers leaks involving offshore companies owned by prominent international figures. Allies of Sharif, who has served as prime minister twice and was toppled in a military coup in 1999, have called the proceedings a political vendetta and hinted at intervention by elements of the powerful army. The Supreme Court disqualified Sharif from office in July over unreported sources of annual income of about $10,000, a salary the former premier denies ever receiving. The high court also ordered the NAB to investigate and conduct a trial into the Sharif family s wider finances, including the London properties. Sharif maintains control of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party, which elected close ally Shahid Khaqi Abbasi as prime minister after Sharif was disqualified.

 New Trump Comments Confirm That Bannon Could Be On His Way OUT (DETAILS),"There have been weeks of reports that White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Senior Adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner have been at each other s throats. Reportedly, the infighting is so bad that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had to moderate a meeting between the two so that they could call a truce. Now, new comments from Donald Trump suggest that he s not so hot on Bannon these days, and if it comes down to it in a knock down, drag out, Bannon v. Kushner fight, Kushner will definitely emerge the victor.Michael Goodwin of the New York Post asked Donald Trump if he was still confident in Bannon s abilities, and for the first time, Trump didn t give a full-throated defense of his white supremacist Chief Strategist. In fact, he seemed to want to downplay the level of Bannon s influence in both the campaign and the White House. Trump told Goodwin: I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late. I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn t know Steve. I m my own strategist and it wasn t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary. When White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the Bannon v. Kushner feud, he tried to say that the media was making too much of it: There s a lot of stuff that was overblown about this that makes it out into the media sometimes and gets a little more sensational than it really is. Of course, this directly contradicts Trump s comments to the New York Post. In addition to the aforementioned statements, Trump also said: Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will. So, in other words, it looks like Bannon is on the chopping block. Perhaps the rest of the white nationalist Pepe brigade will be ousted with him if and when he goes. It s a shame that we have sunk to the level in 2017 of hoping to get avowed white supremacists out of the White House, but here we are.

 OUTRAGE: Bundy Family Terrorists Get Off Scot-Free,"The domestic terrorists who staged an armed takeover of a federal facility have been given a  not guilty  verdict by a jury in Portland, Oregon. Despite their actions not being in dispute the group led by Ammon and Ryan Bundy have just become the latest example of a justice system bending over backwards for some, while punishing others.Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five of their followers, charged in the armed takeover of a federally owned Oregon wildlife sanctuary in January, were acquitted Thursday of federal conspiracy and weapons charges.The verdict brings to a close a case that gripped the nation earlier this year with its public debate about government powers, public lands and constitutional rights.The brothers and their followers took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and held it for six weeks. Their extreme demands were that the federal government surrender control of the 188,000-acre property.The brothers also issued a call to arms to fringe militia groups across the country, asking them to stand with them on the property in the apparent hope that they could trigger another dangerous standoff with the government like Ruby Ridge or Waco, which both ended in death.The Bundy brothers came to national prominence after their father Cliven Bundy refused to pay the Bureau of Land Management after his livestock had grazed on federal property for years. Bundy, an extreme right-winger, believes that the government does not have proper jurisdiction over federal lands. But in fact, repeated court decisions show his position to be in an extreme minority.Initially, mainstream Republican and conservative figures rallied to Bundy s side, including Senator Rand Paul and Fox News host Sean Hannity. But that support faded away when video surfaced of Bundy musing that blacks may have been  better off  as slave instead of having government assistance.Featured image via Multnomah County Sheriff s Office",News,"October 27, 2016",0,1977
Pence used private email while Indiana governor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence used a private email account to conduct public business as governor of Indiana, his office said in a statement on Thursday. The private email account was first reported by the Indianapolis Star, which said Pence used it at times to discuss sensitive matters and homeland security issues. The account was hacked last summer, the newspaper added. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Pence criticized Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state, saying it endangered national security. “Similar to previous governors, during his time as Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence maintained a state email account and a personal email account,” Pence’s office said in a statement. Indiana law does not prohibit public officials from using personal email accounts, the Star said. After Pence was hacked in June by a scammer who sent a plea for money to his email contacts, the governor set up a new AOL account, the Star reported. Pence was chosen by then-Republican candidate Donald Trump as his running mate in July. Indiana law requires all records dealing with state business to be retained and available for public information requests, the Star reported. Pence’s office said in the statement that he directed outside counsel to review all of his communications as Indiana governor to ensure that state-related emails were being transferred and properly archived by the state.

"New Congress prepares to undo Obamacare, weigh Trump personnel picks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new, Republican-controlled U.S. Congress convenes on Tuesday eager to repeal major portions of President Barack Obama’s healthcare law and roll back environmental and financial industry regulations, but could quickly become embroiled in fights over President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet choices. Despite his promise to unite a deeply divided country, Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20 leading a Republican Party that early on will push legislation through Congress without significant - or any - Democratic support. According to a Gallup poll released on Monday, Trump will take office with less than half of Americans confident in his ability to handle an international crisis, use military force wisely or prevent major ethics lapses in his administration. Leading Democrats on Monday warned of a fierce fight over Obamacare, which is expected to have 13.8 million people enrolled in the program that aims to provide health insurance to economically disadvantaged people and to expand coverage for others. Obama is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with congressional Democrats to discuss strategies for fending off Republican attacks on Obamacare. Vice President-elect Mike Pence will meet with his fellow House Republicans the same day to rally them on repealing Obamacare, Politico reported. Republicans in coming weeks will try to steer legislation through Congress using procedures that would not require Democratic cooperation. Their bill, which has not been unveiled, is expected to repeal Obamacare, but postpone the actions for two or three years while also maintaining some of the law’s provisions. “We’re going to fight as hard as ever to protect the ACA (Affordable Care Act), said Representative Steny Hoyer, the House of Representatives’ second-ranking Democrat. Speaking to reporters, Hoyer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said they would launch an effort to mobilize grassroots support for Obamacare by explaining how repeal would create a ripple effect hurting a majority of Americans. For years, Republicans have hammered away at Obamacare, insisting it was unworkable and was hampering job growth. With control of Congress and the White House, they will be in a position to enact a repeal bill. The Senate will have more than legislation on its hands in the new year. It has the daunting task of debating and voting on the scores of appointees Trump already has announced to head his Cabinet departments and for other top jobs in the new administration. It also is expected to receive a Supreme Court nomination early on from Trump, triggering a likely confirmation war. Prominent Senator John McCain has warned that Rex Tillerson, Trump’s choice for secretary of state, will have to explain his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom McCain has called a “thug and a murderer.” Tillerson, who spent much his career at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), has been involved in business dealings in Russia and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea. Meanwhile, Democrats are expected to oppose Republican Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, in part because of his opposition to immigration and past remarks that showed racial insensitivity. And given Trump’s campaign promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington of special interests, especially Wall Street influence, Democrats are also poised to attack the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be treasury secretary. Mnuchin is a successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Nevertheless, Trump is expected to win approval of most, if not all, of his nominees. Besides Obamacare repeal, Republicans also want to curtail or block regulations aimed at controlling industrial emissions that contribute to climate change and banking industry reforms enacted in the wake of the near-collapse of Wall Street several years ago. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who waged bitter battles against Obama over the past eight years, has warned his fellow Republicans against overreaching following their Nov. 8 election victories. In an interview with Kentucky Educational Television on Dec. 19, McConnell said, “It’s certainly no time for hubris” and there is “not much I can do (legislatively) with Republicans only in the U.S. Senate.” While he repeatedly called for removing Obamacare “root and branch,” McConnell said in the interview that his top priorities for the new Congress were dealing with “massive overregulation” that he said has been a brake on the U.S. economy and accomplishing tax code changes to stop companies from moving jobs offshore.

There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,  he said at the time.After Flynn left, Trump defended him, calling the disgraced former national security adviser a  wonderful man. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said in February.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. When Flynn resigned, he apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Mike Pence, who, at the time, was the vice-president elect.Pence then said that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.The day after Flynn resigned, Trump, according to then-FBI Director James Comey, asked him to  let go  of an investigation into Flynn.Trump admitted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, then he asked Comey to drop the investigation.

Myanmar police to free journalists working for Turkish broadcaster,"(Reuters) - Myanmar police said on Tuesday they would drop pending charges against two journalists working for Turkey s state broadcaster, their interpreter and driver, who were jailed in November for violating an aircraft law by filming with a drone. Cameraman Lau Hon Meng from Singapore, reporter Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia, Aung Naing Soe - a local journalist who was interpreting for the pair - and driver Hla Tin were detained by police on Oct. 27 near Myanmar s parliament building in the capital Naypyitaw. They are currently each serving a two-month prison sentence under a colonial-era aircraft law, but all four still face further charges for importing the drone. The two foreign nationals have also been charged with an immigration offence. Police Lieutenant Tun Tun Win and an immigration officer - the complainants - appeared in a Naypyitaw courtroom on Tuesday and asked that the court drop the charges. Tun Tun Win told Reuters higher police officials had ordered the case dropped because the four did not mean to endanger national security by flying the drone. Additionally, he said, the decision was intended  to forward the relationship between countries , referring to the two journalists  home countries, Singapore and Malaysia. A law officer - the government s prosecutor in the case - was expected to tell the court the charges were formally dropped in another hearing set for Thursday, defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told Reuters.  The higher authorities already instructed to terminate with good intention, but the procedure can only be accomplished on that day (Thursday),  the lawyer said. The four are set to complete their sentences under the aircraft act on Jan. 9, but may be released earlier for good behavior, he added. The case had raised concerns over freedom of the press in Myanmar, where a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi took power last year but the military retains control of security matters, including the police. Two Reuters journalists were arrested on Dec. 12 after they went to meet police officers for dinner on the outskirts of Myanmar s largest city Yangon. Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, have now been in detention for two weeks with no access to visitors or to a lawyer.  They had covered the crisis in western Rakhine state that has driven 655,000 stateless Rohingya Muslims across the border to Bangladesh since August. The reporters are being investigated under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. ",worldnews,"December 26, 2017 ",1,2551

HAWAIIAN RESTAURANT Gets Hammered With Negative Reviews After BANNING Trump Supporters: “You cannot eat here”," Honolulu s Caf  8   gets rave reviews on Yelp for its  Radiatore Verde  and  Italian stir fry,  among other popular dishes at the eclectic mom-and-pop restaurant   but the response to its new  policy  barring pro-Trump patrons has been decidedly more mixed.A bright yellow, handmade sign posted on the restaurant s front glass door declares:  If you voted for Trump you cannot eat here! No Nazis. A photo of the sign was shared with FoxNews.com. One also is proudly posted on the caf s Facebook page, and was  liked  by some 40 people.Honolulu resident and Donald Trump voter Susan Roberts told FoxNews.com she found the sign in  extreme poor taste. It s childish and very unprofessional,  she said in an email.   The restaurant owner doesn t have to worry   I will not be stepping foot in that establishment. A Facebook user who wrote on the 8 1/2 Cafe page says he was joking about the restaurant not serving Trump supporters when the owner came over and took away his food:Unlike everybody else, I actually DID eat here recently on a trip. I was there with one of my friends and we thought they were joking about not serving Trump supporters WRONG!!! We were talking about it when all of a sudden a giant fat male comes over, identifies himself as the owner and takes away our food. He still insisted we pay until we called the police and they sorted him out explaining to this guy that you can t take away food and then expect people to pay. What a joke this place is.Here are a few additional comments from Facebook users that were found on the 8 1/2 Cafe website:Maybe someone should call the health department on them. Didn t someone see a rat skittering across the floor or maybe that was cockroaches.No need to eat at a restaurant owned by a Trumpophobe  they ll be sued shortly for discrimination, just like the bakers were who wouldn t bake cakes for gay weddings.Like the Nazis put signs in the windows of restaurants and businesses  No Jews Allowed  . I find it strange that your sign says no Nazis no Trump supporters? Yet you are doing the exact same thing the Nazis did in Poland. Your business will suffer because you do not understand the power of social media, nor do you understand the power of Trump supporters. Oh, by the way your food looks like shit!Going to Hawaii this summer but I will stay away from your so called restaurant. I voted for Trump and apparently my money isn t good enough for you  your choice. By the way you might want to pick up a history book and read about the Nazis I think you might find the similarities in you both uncanny. People should be able to get food without hearing a political message,  one apparent former customer wrote on Yelp.  I will never go back. The 8 1/2 Cafe received so many negative comments on YELP that the service designed to rate restaurants as a way to help consumers find good food had to step in and shut down the comment and ratings section for their restaurant:According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, the caf  was founded by Robert Warner, a former hair stylist for Vidal Sassoon in San Francisco and former restaurateur in Seattle, along with his wife Jali.

French foreign minister to travel to Libya to push peace deal,"PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign minister said on Thursday he would head to Libya  very soon  to push warring parties to support a peace roadmap tentatively agreed in Paris in July.  Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and the divided country s eastern commander Khalifa Haftar verbally committed last month to a conditional ceasefire and to work toward holding elections next spring.  I will be traveling to Libya very soon to ensure the follow-up of this meeting and to get the support of all sides to the declaration that was adopted then,  Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a speech to French ambassadors. France, which took a leading role in the NATO air campaign that helped rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi, has sought to play a greater role in Libya, believing diplomatic efforts were stalling and that under President Emmanuel Macron it could fill that void. Officials fear jihadist groups could try to exploit the power vacuum in Libya to regroup after losing substantial ground in Syria and Iraq, and see a resolution to the conflict as vital to ending Europe s migrant crisis.  In Libya, France along with others has a specific responsibility to help this country find unity and stability,  Le Drian said. Past attempts at peace deals in oil-producing Libya have often been scuttled by internal divisions among the myriad of competing armed groups that have emerged since rebels toppled  Gaddafi in 2011.  Diplomats declined to say specifically when Le Drian was traveling due to security reasons.   The French initiative has angered officials in Italy, which has previously taken the lead in efforts to bring peace to its former North African colony and borne the brunt of successive waves of African migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya.

New Wall Street candidates emerge to test Trump-era appeal,"(Reuters) - With a businessman turned politician now in the Oval Office, a small but growing number of bankers and Wall Street financiers across the United States have set their sights on politics. In New Jersey, Connecticut and California, former bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives have either announced bids for legislative and gubernatorial seats, or associates have told Reuters they are considering running. Meanwhile, industry trade groups including the American Bankers Association are launching formal programs to teach members in various states how to campaign successfully. It is not the first time well-heeled candidates have entered American politics, and there are not a great number of them. But historians, political scientists and bankers say the atmosphere has changed abruptly under President Donald Trump. “It’s certainly raised the visibility of folks who in the past may have said ‘I’m not a politician,” said Richard Baier, president of the Nebraska Bankers Association, which is launching a training school for potential legislative candidates. “We’ve shown that you don’t really need that background.” The Oklahoma Bankers Association is also planning to launch its own candidate school, a spokesman said. Foreclosures, job losses and growing income inequality after the 2007-2009 financial crisis made anyone with Wall Street ties into a political pariah. But Trump, a self-described billionaire who made a fortune in New York real estate and entertainment, has stocked his cabinet with Wall Street bankers and industry tycoons. His presidency has inspired others in the financial community to pursue civic duty, according to people who have studied campaigns or are involved with current election efforts. Trump’s ascendance shows that candidates’ backgrounds matter less than whether they can connect with voters, said Joshua Sandman, a political science professor at the University of New Haven. “Trump running has encouraged more people in financial services to test the waters,” he said, “but the water could be murky for them unless they have a real set of positive experiences within business and are reflective of creating jobs and helping people.” It is hard to say quantitatively whether more candidates with finance backgrounds are pursuing political office now compared with prior election cycles. But Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut who has researched candidates’ backgrounds, says he is skeptical about how successful the new crop of candidates will be. “Sure, the mood is better than it was when the market collapsed, but I don’t think people say, ‘Wall Street financier – that’s someone I can vote for,” he said. Phil Murphy, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor in 2017, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive who spent 23 years at the firm, is perhaps the most prominent moneyed candidate. His campaign has focused on bolstering the middle class with proposals to create a millionaire’s tax and launch other initiatives to help low-income residents. Murphy has won support from labor unions, environmental groups and consumer rights activists, as well as bold-faced names in the Democratic party like former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, who have both endorsed him. An Oct. 3 Monmouth University Poll has him leading his Republican rival, Kim Guadagno by 14 points, and over 60 percent of New Jersey voters said Murphy’s ties to Goldman do not matter in a recent Quinnipiac Poll. “Obviously Goldman was his career,” said Tony Bianchini, spokesman for the Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters, which is backing Murphy. “Everyone has a career.” In Connecticut, former UBS Group AG executive Robert Stefanowski is running for governor, according to a public filing, and hedge fund manager David Stemerman recently said he may do the same. The two Republicans have given few clues about their campaign strategies other than to cast themselves as outsiders who can fix Connecticut’s problems. In California, two Wall Street veterans are mulling runs as progressive Democrats. Tom Steyer, an environmentalist who worked at Goldman Sachs and was a hedge fund manager, may run for Senate or governor, a person familiar with the matter said. Joseph Sanberg, a former Tiger Global Management LLC executive, is also considering a Senate run, according to Politico. He casts himself as a “progressive entrepreneur” on his website. Other ex-Wall Streeters who have entered politics have a mixed history, and much depends on how well their messages align with voters’ concerns, political historians said. For instance, while Mitt Romney’s private-equity career helped doom his 2012 presidential bid, Illinois voters elected private equity executive Bruce Rauner as governor in 2014.

Italy's ruling PD slides further in polls as election nears,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s ruling Democratic Party (PD), hit by internal divisions and a banking scandal, is continuing to slide in opinion polls, with a new survey on Saturday putting it more than six points behind the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. The survey by the Ixe agency, commissioned by Huffington Post Italia, comes just days before parliament is expected to be dissolved to make way for elections in March. It gives the center-left PD just 22.8 percent of voter support, down almost five points in the last two months, compared with 29.0 percent for 5-Star, which has gained almost two points in the same period. Silvio Berlusconi s center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) is given 16.2 percent, with its right-wing allies the Northern League and Brothers of Italy on 12.1 percent and 5.0 percent respectively. This bloc is expected to win most seats at the election but not enough for an absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament. With the PD s support eroding in virtually all opinion polls, several political commentators have speculated that its leader Matteo Renzi may choose or be forced to announce he will not be the party s candidate for prime minister at the election. Renzi has given no indication so far he will take this step. The PD has split under his leadership, with critics complaining he has dragged the traditionally center-left party to the right.  Breakaway groups united this month to form a new left-wing party called Free and Equal (LeU), which now has 7.3 percent of support, according to Ixe. The PD s popularity seems to have also been hurt by a parliamentary commission looking into the collapse of 10 Italian banks in the past two years.  The commission s findings have put the PD on the defensive, allowing the opposition to claim a conflict of interest involving one of Renzi s closest allies who was active in trying to save a bank where her father was a board member.

" Fox News Posted A Photo Of Two Gorillas, So Their Racist Fans Trashed The Obamas (SCREENSHOTS)","Once again, conservatives have gone above and beyond to prove that quite literally anything will send them into a racist tirade against the President of the United States.On Mother s Day, Fox News posted photos on Facebook of a gorilla who had recently given birth unexpectedly. The pregnancy was a bit of a shock to the staff at Prague Zoo, who say they had  given up hope  that Shinda, the 24-year-old primate, would ever have a baby. The gorilla had experienced numerous miscarriages, so staff simply assumed she was overweight. But late last month, Shinda gave birth successfully. After suffering several miscarriages, Shinda was expected to remain childless,  Fox News posted.  But the 24-year-old gorilla surprised everyone at the Prague Zoo in April when she gave birth to a healthy baby! Almost immediately the nigh-predictable screeching began, with Fox News fans reciting effortlessly their favorite lines, like  If Obama had a son.  Others decided that their hateful screeds should be directed at Michelle and Malia Obama.                      Unfortunately, this is the sort of thing sane people are forced to tolerate. Recently, upon hearing that Malia Obama had gotten into Harvard, the Stupid Part of America spewed their hatred in a similar manner. Fox News fans swooped in, calling her a  n*gger, an  affirmative action parasite,  and suggesting that  Little Ape  (that s their cute little nickname for her)  go to college in Africa. In December, Fox News posted a photo of an orangutan in a Santa hat. You can guess what happened.It s easy to be shocked by Donald Trump s popularity. But the secret of his appeal   his racism, his narcissism, his Islamophobic hate speech, the (I assume by now) gold-plated, 1,000-foot wall with mounted machine guns every 27 1/2 feet and f*cking lazers, and the fact that he probably wants to f*ck his own daughter  is equally simple. He has a built-in audience.For years, Fox News has been catering to the very worst in society. For years, they have been shaping the opinion of the distressingly large percentage of Americans who are unable to use a fork without adult supervision, and for years they have been perpetuating lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie about President Obama.Fox News built Donald Trump s audience for him, and he harnessed that hate.

Egypt arrests dozens in crackdown on gays,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt has arrested 22 people in the past three days as part of a crackdown on gays after a rainbow flag was raised at a concert, activists and rights groups said on Monday. At least 33 people have been arrested since Sept. 23, a day after a group of people were seen raising the flag, a rare public show of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the conservative Muslim country. The public prosecutor announced an investigation after local media launched a highly critical campaign against those who raised the rainbow flag at a Mashrou  Leila concert, a popular Lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay. On Monday police arrested Ahmed Alaa and Sarah Hegazy, the latter being the first woman involved in such an incident in years, in relation to the case, their lawyer said. They were both charged with  joining a group formed in contrary to the law  and  propagating that group s idea . Hegazy faced a further charge of  promoting sexual deviancy and debauchery  and the Supreme State Security Prosecution ordered them detained for 15 days, lawyer Amr Mohamed told Reuters. Two men had been arrested earlier in relation to the flag incident but one was released. The remaining arrests were unrelated to the incident but have all been over the perceived sexual orientation of the defendants and came after it. At least 10 men were arrested between Sept. 28-30 and six others earlier that week, judicial sources said. All 16 went on trial on Sunday charged with  promoting sexual deviancy  and  debauchery , euphemisms for homosexuality. A verdict is due on Oct. 29. One man has been sentenced to six years in jail over similar charges. Although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in Egypt, it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife. Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy. Those arrested are subjected to anal examinations to determine whether they have had gay sex, which rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say amounts to torture. Five such examinations have taken place, Amnesty International said on Monday. Judicial sources do not deny the examinations take place but say they are legally carried out and are not a form of abuse.  In a matter of days the Egyptian security forces have rounded up dozens of people and carried out five anal examinations signaling a sharp escalation in the authorities  efforts to persecute and intimidate members of the LGBTI community following the rainbow flag incident,  said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty.  In 2001, 52 men were arrested when police raided a floating disco called the Queen Boat. ",worldnews,"October 2, 2017 ",1,2770
 Trump ‘Clarifies’ Abortion Comments: I Meant That Women Should Punish THEMSELVES (VIDEO),"Every time Donald Trump tries to walk back his  punishment  comments on abortion, he only manages to become even more offensive and misogynistic.In a recent New York Times interview with reporter Robert Draper, Trump made yet another pathetic attempt to clarify the disgusting comments he made during an interview with MSNBC s Chris Matthews in March, where he stated that women should get  some form of punishment  for seeking an abortion. Trump originally tried to correct his comments shortly after by saying only doctors who perform illegal abortions should face criminal charges   which was still a very anti-woman stance to take. Now, Trump has made another attempt to defend his comments   and it s just as bad. Trump said: I didn t mean punishment for women like prison. I m saying women punish themselves. I didn t want people to think in terms of  prison  punishment. And because of that I walked it back. TwitterBut it turns out, every time Trump walks his comments back, it s only because he s receiving backlash and he wants to do damage control   he s not really sorry at all. Draper investigated Trump s claims that he hadn t meant that women should be punished, and discovered that the presumptive Republican nominee was lying through his teeth. Draper reported that Trump initially saw nothing wrong with his remark and refused to walk it back  before giving a statement. It wasn t until numerous media outlets swarmed him that Trump tried to soften the blow with another statement that said the exact opposite. Those two contradictory statements were released approximately an hour apart   but that s nothing new for the dishonest, constantly contradicting and flip-flopping candidate.You can watch Trump s original  punishment  comments below and see for yourself that Trump s claim that it was a misinterpretation is complete bullsh*t. This is a guy who clearly hates women, and will be a major threat to their health, safety and future if he gets the White House.To prove just how crazy Trump is, in the same Times interview, Trump insisted he would do better on women s issues than Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton and  everybody else combined.  He said, Frankly, for the general election I think that s a very good issue for me. Trump still remains completely oblivious that almost three quarters of American women hate his guts. And of course, shaming and telling them that they should punish themselves for having an abortion isn t going to help.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez / Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2016",0,2622

China says it wants smooth military ties with Trump,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it wanted to develop smooth military-to-military ties with the new U.S. administration of Donald Trump. While the world’s two largest economies are frequently at odds over issues like the disputed South China Sea, both have been trying to improve trust between their armed forces to reduce the risk of misunderstanding in any encounters. This month, China and the United States staged a three-day humanitarian relief military drill as part of that trust-building exercise. New concern looms with Trump’s election as U.S. president. He lambasted China on the campaign trail and has suggested Japan and South Korea be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Asked about Trump’s election, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said it went without saying there were tensions in the military relationship and China hoped the United States would respect its core interests and concerns. “China is willing to work hard together with the defense department of the next U.S. government to promote the healthy and stable development of military-to-military relations,” Yang told a monthly news briefing. Trump will take over as president in January.  ",politicsNews,"November 30, 2016 ",1,1241
" Jimmy Kimmel Asks Trump Supporters To Say ONE Nice Thing About Hillary, This Is What Happened (VIDEO)","In the simplest of terms, one way to describe Donald Trump supporters would be to call them interesting. However, not interesting in a way where they have profound things to say and should be respected for all the things they do, but rather interesting in a way like when you visit a circus and wonder how so many clowns can fit into one car. That would, in fact, be interesting to find out.Catching up with a few of these interesting people was none other than Jimmy Kimmel s team on his late night show. He interviewed a number of them on the street in Hollywood and told them that it s Hillary Clinton s birthday. He then asked if they could say at least one nice thing about her for her birthday. The replies were, let s just say, less than kind.One woman said: I can t say anything positive. I d ask her if it s truly her birthday or if she s lying about that too. Another guy said: Happy birthday, Hillary. I hope you get arrested. One woman did muster up the strength to compliment Hillary s hair, but she wasn t happy about saying it.It definitely seems like there s a lot of anger coming out of the Trump campaign and their supporters, along with a lot of false information.

Trump Cabinet's First World problem: omitting a few million here and there,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s Cabinet is worth a combined $14 billion, and they are catching flak in recent weeks for confessing an inability to keep track of their vast sums of wealth. But private bankers who work with the ultra rich say that if they had a dollar for every time a client forgot about a million, they would be, well, almost as rich as their clients. “We see it all the time,” with new clients, said Chris Walters of GenSpring Family Offices, SunTrust Bank Inc’s (STI.N) branch for clients with more than $50 million in assets. “It’s not that they are surprised they own the asset. They just omitted it in the inventory.” Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) partner who is Trump’s pick to lead the U.S. Treasury Department, was grilled by members of the Senate last week for inadvertently failing to disclose more than $100 million in real estate. On Tuesday, the nominee for head of the budget office, Mick Mulvaney, said he did not realize he needed to pay $15,000 in federal taxes for a nanny until scrutinizing his finances more closely for confirmation proceedings.  Trump himself said in an interview with Reuters last March that he does not pay much attention to his own investments in hedge funds and mutual funds. “I have no idea how they are doing. I don’t really care,” Trump said. “I’m in a lot of things. I may be in a few funds. I have no idea if they are up or down. I just know that they have been very good over a period of time.” Trump’s lawyer Sheri Dillon has since said that he has liquidated all of his investments. Senate leadership has delayed confirmation hearings for three other wealthy Trump nominees to allow more time for nominees to file disclosures and to accommodate schedules. In response to questions about how people with millions or billions of dollars who hire experts to carefully tally their vast wealth could lose track of such big chunks of money, private bankers and family office managers said their clients simply live much more complicated financial lives than ordinary people. About one-in-five people with more than $25 million in assets hire advisers to take care of tasks like paying daily bills, managing staff at multiple homes and keeping track of assets around the globe, according to a report by research firm Spectrem. Advisers say their clients need this type of assistance because they work, socialize and travel too frequently to take care of mundane tasks themselves. Eileen Foley, head of Bank of New York Mellon Corp’s (BK.N) family office business, said that some clients want daily reports detailing every dollar that goes in and out of each account. They also ask for daily reports on investments, tangible assets, properties and liabilities. When a client is nominated for a position on the board of a public company or in government, this type of daily monitoring can help she said: “It’s not a fire drill.” But even with that type of due diligence, clients often forget to mention assets held by multiple people, like limited partnerships. Those structures are harder for advisers to discover in financial statements, because they are often structured to keep ownership opaque. Mnuchin, for instance, failed to disclose around $900,000 worth of artwork held by his children, according to media reports. Mnuchin did not respond to requests for comment. He also did not initially disclose homes in New York, Los Angeles and Mexico. The complexity of a rich person’s financial life usually builds over time as they acquire houses and collections and other belongings, advisers said. In many cases, if a client has not been forced to detail all their assets or confirm that every domestic employee has insurance coverage, then they probably have not done it, said Bill Woodson, head of North American family offices at Citigroup Inc’s (C.N) private bank. “It’s understandable why” they forget, he said. “It doesn’t excuse it.” (This story corrects spelling of flak in first paragraph).

"BUSTED! DEM TX REP PLAYS RACE CARD, LIES ABOUT TREATMENT BY COP…Uncovered Dash Cam Shows Truth [VIDEO]","The race card thing is getting old fast The Austin County Sheriff s Office released the dash camera video of a July 14 traffic stop of State Representative Garnet Coleman Tuesday to refute claims Coleman made last week about being disrespected and treated  like a child. Coleman, as the chair of the Committee on County Affairs, held a hearing last Thursday in Austin as the first public inquiry into the arrest and death of Sandra Bland in Waller County. In that hearing, Coleman recounted his own history of being pulled over in traffic stops and gave this account of an I-10 traffic stop that happened just two weeks ago. He talked to me like I was a child,  he said of the sheriff s deputy who pulled him over for speeding.  He was so rude and nasty. Even when he found out I was a legislator, he became more rude and nasty. And I didn t understand why this guy was continuing to go on and on and treat me like a child. And basically like I m saying is treat me like a boy. I want to be very clear about that,  Coleman said in the committee hearing.  Via: Breaking 911KHOU    The Texas Municipal Police Association, the Harris County Deputies Organization, the Houston Police Officers  Union and the Dallas Police Union all issued demands for Coleman to apologize for his  fabrication  of the events in the traffic stop. Sheriff Brandes asked Coleman to apologize for his remarks about the sheriff s deputy. Instead, Coleman seemed to double down on the race card  boy  word. They may not have [thought it was rude],  Coleman told KHOU.  But they weren t sitting in my seat. And, if you know the history of my people, you know that being treated like a child or a boy is not something that we accept very well. The Houston Police Officers Union (HPOU) issued a strong rebuke to Coleman.  Our organization has supported Representative Coleman during his tenure in the Texas Legislature, however, since Representative Coleman refuses to own up to the fact that his statements in committee regarding the stop were in fact not true and completely out of line, we have no choice but to discontinue our support of him.

Trump order frees tax-exempt churches to be more politically active,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that allows tax-exempt churches to more actively participate in politics and could free religious organizations to deny employees insurance coverage for birth-control pills. The order partially fulfills an oft-repeated campaign promise by Trump, who appealed to religious conservatives in his 2016 run for the White House, although he would need an act of Congress to rescind the underlying law that he has opposed, known as the Johnson Amendment. The order was widely praised by religious organizations that either felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it, but others denounced it as putting women’s health in jeopardy or weakening the U.S. tradition of separating church and state. “We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced any more,” Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House where religious leaders had gathered in support. “No one should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors,” he said. Trump’s order directs the Internal Revenue Service to “alleviate the burden of the Johnson Amendment,” the White House said in reference to a 1954 law sponsored by Lyndon Johnson, then a Texas senator who later became president. Under that amendment, the tax code prohibits organizations that enjoy tax-free status from participating in a political campaign or supporting any one candidate for elective office. The order also asks the government to issue rules that would allow religious groups such as the Little Sister of the Poor to deny their employees insurance coverage for services that they oppose on religious grounds, such as birth-control pills. Those employees would be forced to go outside their employer-provided insurance plan for subsidized contraceptives, said Lori Windham, a lawyer who represents the group. “Today’s announcement is a great day for the Little Sisters,” Windham said. The American Civil Liberties Union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order but later backed off, saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it falls way short of meeting Trump’s pledge to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment. At least one expert said Trump’s order appears legally sound. Rolling back the Johnson Amendment does not favor any particular religious views over others, and the president has broad authority to decide not to enforce certain laws, said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law.

U.S. lawmakers probing Wells Fargo scandal blast arbitration pacts,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co customers aiming to sue the bank over bogus accounts opened in their names may be in for an unpleasant surprise: the fine print requires them to take their claims to an arbitrator instead of a court. Mandatory arbitration rules inserted into account-opening agreements prohibit customers from joining class actions or suing the third-largest U.S. bank in court. Instead, the agreements require individual, closed-door arbitration.  U.S. senators highlighted the issue on Tuesday as they grilled Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf during a hearing. Asked if he would set aside the mandatory arbitration agreements for customers affected by the phantom accounts, Stumpf demurred. “I’m not an expert in that,” he said, adding he would talk to his legal team. That was not enough for some lawmakers. “If we had class action on this in 2010, 2009, 2008, the problem never would have gotten so out of hand,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said later, when questioning regulators about the practice. Class actions can be more affordable for unhappy customers, especially those with limited resources, because they can band together to sue, rather than having to hire lawyers individually. Consumers also complain that target companies often choose the arbitrators; proceedings are confidential; and decisions are hard to appeal. Three Wells Fargo customers filed a lawsuit Friday in a Utah federal court, seeking class action status on behalf of hundreds of thousands of customers nationwide they say were harmed by the San Francisco-based bank’s fraud and recklessness. It was unclear whether they could get around the mandatory arbitration clauses, though. Last year, Wells successfully invoked the clauses to defend against a class action suit tied to bogus accounts. In that case, the judge said customers had to arbitrate because of agreements they signed when opening legitimate accounts at the bank. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a brainchild of Warren, was part of the regulatory group that negotiated a $190 million settlement from Wells Fargo over the bogus accounts. The bureau is considering rules to ban banks, credit card issuers and other companies from forcing customers to submit to arbitration and waive their right to join class action lawsuits. Under the proposal, companies could still use arbitration, but would have to tell consumers they could join class action lawsuits instead. Mandating arbitration when signing up for financial products has become standard practice after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision validated the practice. Still, the tide may be turning, said Joseph Peiffer, a New Orleans lawyer who has represented investors and others in class action lawsuits.  “Class actions dissuade companies from ripping people off a thousand dollars here and a thousand dollars there,” Peiffer said.

Second group of refugees to leave Australian camp for U.S. resettlement,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A second group of about 30 refugees held in Australian-run detention centers on South Pacific islands will leave soon for resettlement in the United States under a controversial refugee swap deal, a U.S. official said on Tuesday. The first group of 22, including men from Bangladesh, Sudan and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, left one of the camps on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea on Sunday. They were due to board a plane from Port Moresby to Manila later on Tuesday on their way to the United States. Beverly Thacker, public affairs officer for the U.S. embassy in Papua New Guinea, said a second group would leave soon from the other center on the tiny island of Nauru.  I understand the group of refugees from Nauru will fly via Port Moresby before traveling on to the United States on Wednesday,  she said. Australia agreed on a deal with former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year under which up to 1,250 refugees held in the Australian camps will be offered residency. In return, Australia agreed to resettle several dozen Central American refugees. Those refugees were expected to arrive in Australia within weeks. U.S. President Donald Trump has described the deal as  dumb  but begrudgingly said he will honor it. Concerns persist, however, that many of the refugees in the Australian-run camps will not be offered U.S. resettlement, with the Trump administration vowing that only those who satisfy  extreme vetting  will be approved. Nearly 2,000 men, women and children are held on Manus island and Nauru, where most of them have been awarded refugee status. Despite their refugee status, many of those on Nauru and Manus island have been held for four years in conditions widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups. Under Canberra s hardline immigration policy, asylum-seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia are sent for processing on Manus island and Nauru and are told they will never be settled in Australia.

 Giuliani’s PATHETIC Excuse For Trump’s Bragging About Sexual Assault Will Disgust You,"A tape featuring Donald Trump proudly boasting about sexually assaulting women has rocked the GOP this weekend. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is trying to brush it off as no big deal, arguing that men just  talk like that.  But CNN s Jake Tapper did not let him get away with this pathetic excuse.Appearing on State of the Union this Sunday morning, the former NYC mayor tried in vain to convince everybody that this was just locker talk and voters should still support Trump, even if he does brag about grabbing women  by the p*ssy. This is talk, and gosh almighty, he who hasn t sinned, throw the first stone,  Giuliani said of Trump s remarks on the leaked tape from 2005.Tapper cut him off and slammed Giuliani s bullshit argument.  Mr. Mayor, I have never said that. I have never done that,  Tapper said.  I am happy to throw a stone. I have been in locker rooms, I have been a member of a fraternity. I have never heard any man, ever, brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it. Giuliani wasn t dissuaded and continued to insist that this is just how men are. The fact is men, at times, talk like that. Not all men. Tapper asked the former mayor if he had ever said these kinds of things, but Giuliani just kept talking and pretended not to have heard the question. Giuliani then insisted:  I m not justifying it.  But he also never denied having made comments like this himself.Earlier in the interview, Giuliani said that Trump had apologized for his behavior and was likely to do so again during the upcoming debate on Sunday night. He apologized for them, he said that he was wrong, that doesn t reflect the way he looks at things today,  Giuliani said.  He made a full and complete apology for it, and I think he s going to do it again tonight.

And in a disgusting defense of Trump, who is in the middle of trying to portray himself as the best candidate for women, Nugent went on a tirade against Fox News host Megyn Kelly in which the Motor City Madman said: I often turn on Fox just to look at her. Sometimes when I m loading my [gun ammunition] magazines, I like to just look at her. And I usually sit naked on the couch dropping hot brass on my stuff. Not only does Nugent prefer guns to real women, he also prefers teen girls over women as well. He wrote and performed a song about raping a 13-year-old girl in 1981. Two years earlier, Nugent suckered a 17-year-old girl s parents into making him her legal guardian so he could have sex with her.In short, not only is Nugent a coward when it comes time for real men to take action in defense of their country, he s terrified of strong independent women who think for themselves.

" Obama Puts Trump In His Place, DESTROYS Him With This One Statement During Farewell Address (VIDEO)","President Barack Obama gave an amazing farewell address last night as he captivated Americans across the country and said goodbye to his time as President of the United States. At a time when many of us were feeling heartbroken and depressed that this great leader would now be followed by an underserving former reality television star, Obama made sure to leave us with a message of hope and reminded us of what we re fighting for. It was a beautiful speech, and it highlighted everything we are going to miss about him.One of the more notable parts of the speech was an epic burn Obama delivered, aimed right at President-elect Donald Trump. While Obama never once said Trump s name, it was blatantly obvious who he was talking about as he spoke about the need for diverse groups of workers to unite and stand together. Slamming Trump s divisive rhetoric and policies, Obama reached out to workers of all ages, races, genders, and professions when he said: But we re not where we need to be. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children   because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America s workforce. And our economy doesn t have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women. Beautifully said. While Trump may have won the election by dividing Americans and speaking only to white workers in certain professions, Americans can stop him from dividing us further by standing together. Aside from preventing Trump from creating more division, united workers must also defy him by standing up to his greedy pro-corporation agenda which will only benefit the wealthiest.Obama knew that he had to inspire Americans enough to get them through the next four years under the worst administration they ve ever been faced with.

Trump taps net neutrality opponent Ajit Pai to head FCC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday tapped Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai to head the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to roll back many of the Obama Administration’s telecommunications and internet policies. Pai, a former Justice Department, FCC and Capitol Hill staffer, in December predicted landmark “net neutrality” rules adopted in 2015 would not last. The son of Indian immigrants who grew up in Kansas, Pai said the commission should take a “weed whacker” to unneeded rules and was harshly critical of many FCC regulations imposed during the Obama administration. “During the Trump administration, we will shift from playing defense at the FCC to going on offense,” he said in December. “We need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation, and job creation.” Pai will also have a key role in deciding whether to approve or reject or impose conditions on mergers involving cable and telephone companies. In May, Pai opposed FCC conditions imposed on Charter Communication’s acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Last week, then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler urged Republicans against dismantling internet access protections that bar service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely. The Republican-controlled Congress is also considering rewriting the net neutrality rules. Pai said in 2015 that consumers would be worse under net neutrality and should “expect their bills to go up, and they should expect that broadband will be slower going forward.” Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat, criticized Pai in a letter to President Donald Trump Monday as “not a supporter of the FCC’s strong rules to protect an open internet, putting at risk our robust net neutrality rules and the three million internet economy jobs it supports.” Under Wheeler, the FCC and major telecom and cable companies have been at odds over a number of big issues in recent years, including tougher broadband privacy rules and a proposal to allow pay-TV consumers to ditch set top boxes. Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Frontier Communications Corp, T-Mobile US Inc and Charter all praised Pai’s appointment in separate statements. “Chairman Pai will work with his fellow commissioners to quickly and decisively put back in place the commonsense regulatory framework necessary to support the president’s agenda,” AT&T said. However, advocacy group Free Press President Craig Aaron said Pai “has been on the wrong side of just about every major issue that has come before the FCC during his tenure. He’s never met a mega-merger he didn’t like or a public safeguard he didn’t try to undermine.” U.S. Telecom, an industry trade group, said in a statement it shares Pai’s vision for a “future based on a bold but pragmatic strategy to erase the many regulatory barriers impeding the expansion of our nation’s communications infrastructure, and the jobs and economic opportunity that depend on it.” Pai does not need Senate confirmation as chairman but his current term expires at year end and he will need to be reconfirmed to continue.

 Kim Davis Utters Four Words To Describe Obama’s Speech – Gets Burned Alive For It (VIDEO),"Rowan county clerk Kim Davis already had her five minutes of fame; her time is over and done with. Or is it? At, least, it was until some Republican by the name of Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) gave tickets to President Obama s last State of the Union address to the Family Research Council, who then, in turn, gave the exclusive rights to one of the tickets to Mrs. Davis.Now, unfortunately, her five minutes of fame has been extended to six minutes. Heck, we wouldn t even grant her that right if she wasn t one of the top trending topics in the internet chatter world Tuesday night. But, the reality is, she is. For some reason, people can t get enough of Kim Davis   she must have all the makings of a star.A reporter caught up with Davis after Obama concluded his last remarks for the night, and uttered just four words of what she thought about her experience: It was a speech.

But, hey, what else do you expect coming from the mouth of Kim Davis? Here is a suggestion for Kim, in four words:  just do your job.In all fairness, the internet was much harsher to her than her characterization of the president s speech ever was, and it s not even close. While it s never a good thing to be mean, she must have known a good roasting was coming her way.Here are a few of the top (and funniest) comments she received on the internet after so brazenly deciding to show her face on the most important day in politics.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.What can we say? Kim keeps showing up in the limelight and we, as a people, continue taking the bait. She may not be relevant, but she sure is a target   no one can disagree with that. Her facial expressions were probably some of the most scrutinized, right up there with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. He appeared virtually emotionless throughout the entire speech, with a few slight movements here and there. It was almost like there was an unannounced contest between him and Kim Davis on who could appear to be the least interested in whatever the president was saying. Maybe they were playing chicken with each other; we don t know. What is clear is that Kim Davis will forever be in our memories, if not in our hearts.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 13, 2016",0,2648
" Native American Tribal Leader Shuts Down Oregon’s Cry-Baby White Militia, And It’s Glorious (IMAGE/VIDEO)","It has been almost a week since over 20 armed gunmen occupied a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, demanding the land be returned to its  rightful owners . The Chair of the areas Native American tribe had something to say about that, and it s a mic drop.When chair of Burns Paiute tribe heard protestors would return land to its rightful owners, she joked she started writing acceptance letter  Salvador Hernandez (@SalHernandez) January 6, 2016One of the armed gunmen, Ryan Payne, spoke to the New York Times on Tuesday, claiming that: the federal government unconstitutionally laid claim to land within the United States,  and people who use and love the land   ranchers, miners, and loggers, among others   deserve to have it back.The 5.2 million Native American and Alaska Native s identified by the 2010 U.S. Census might be a little more familiar with this problem that the ammosexual occupiers of the Oregon reserve.An interactive map put together by the science and humanities magazine Aeon shows details the land grab of 1776 to 1887, during which the United States seized over 1.5 billion acres from America s indigenous people by treaty and executive order.The short video below shows the near total transfer of land from Native American tribes to the United States over that time frame.  On Wednesday of this week, the Burns Paiute Tribe, who s reservation is close to the armed occupation, called on the militia-men to leave.

Florida Supreme Court strikes down new death penalty law,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida’s Supreme Court overturned a new state death penalty law on Friday because it does not require juries to unanimously recommend capital punishment, a ruling with potential implications for ongoing prosecutions and 385 death row inmates. Executions in Florida, home to the nation’s second-largest death row, have been on hold since the U.S. Supreme Court in January struck down the state’s death penalty sentencing laws. Friday’s ruling by Florida’s high court marked another step towards death sentence recommendations becoming unanimous jury decisions in all U.S. states.  The U.S. Supreme Court’s 8-1 ruling invalidated how a judge sentenced Timothy Hurst to death for the 1998 murder of a fried-chicken restaurant manager. It found Florida gave judges powers that juries should wield in determining death eligibility. In response, the Florida legislature this spring rewrote its death sentencing laws, requiring at least 10 of 12 jurors to support capital punishment, instead of a simple majority.  That law “is unconstitutional because it requires that only ten jurors recommend death as opposed to the constitutionally required unanimous, twelve-member jury,” the state’s high court found, adding that the law could not be applied to pending prosecutions.  “It’s big,” said Marty McClain, a prominent Florida death penalty attorney involved in one of the cases. “There is no constitutional death penalty statute in place until it’s fixed.” Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office said while it is “reviewing the ruling pending a possible rehearing, juries in current active capital trials must make unanimous decisions in capital cases as to the appropriateness of the death penalty,” a spokesman said in an email. Florida’s incoming House speaker, Republican Richard Corcoran, said his chamber would consider options and called the ruling an “effort to subvert the will of the people as expressed by their elected representatives.” Among U.S. states, only Alabama and Delaware also allowed for non-unanimous jury decisions at the time of the high court’s ruling. Delaware’s top court in August struck down its death penalty statute. The U.S. Supreme Court has directed a review in Alabama. “This is significant going forward,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, noting that non-unanimous juries in Florida and Alabama imposed a quarter of U.S. death sentences in recent years. Florida’s Supreme Court vacated Hurst’s death sentence and ordered a new penalty phase hearing. It did not address the retroactivity of its findings for other cases. “There will have to be searching scrutiny in nearly 400 cases,” Dunham said. ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1,2762

"Singapore names first woman president, raising eyebrows over election process","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore named a former speaker of parliament as the multicultural city-state s first woman president on Wednesday while critics expressed dismay that other candidates were disqualified and the election went uncontested. Aiming to strengthen a sense of inclusivity, Singapore had decreed the presidency, a largely ceremonial six-year post, would be reserved for candidates from the minority Malay community this time. The returning officer declared Halimah Yacob, 63, elected on Wednesday after nominations closed. Of the four other applicants, two were not Malays and two were not qualified to contest, the elections department said on Monday. Halimah had automatically qualified because she held a senior public post for over three years. If the election had been held, all citizens would have been eligible to vote. Several critics went online to protest against the stringent eligibility rules, which include a stipulation that a candidate from the private sector should have headed a company with paid-up capital of at least S$500 million ($370 million). The prime minister s office said it had no comment on   criticism of the election process.  It would have restored some of the lost moral authority by her winning against credible opponents through popular votes,  said opposition politician Yee Jenn Jong in a blog post.  She is, after all, a veteran in elections and has won handsomely in the four general elections she stood in.  The rights group Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) said it hoped  more will be done to improve access to politics for all of Singapore s women .  Unfortunately, the process that led to this outcome has not reflected our hopes,  it said in a statement posted online. Displays of dissent are rare in Singapore, one of the richest and most politically stable countries in the world. It has been ruled by the People s Action Party (PAP) since independence in 1965 and the current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, is the son of the country s founding father Lee Kuan Yew. In the 2015 general election   held months after the death of Lee Kuan Yew   the PAP won almost 70 per cent of the popular vote and swept all but six of parliament s 89 seats. The incoming president, who is to be sworn in on Thursday, appeared unfazed by the controversy.  Although this is a reserved election, I m not a reserved president,  Halimah said in a speech at the election nominations office.  I m a president for everyone.  Whether or not there is an election or no election, my promise is to serve everyone and I will serve with great vigor, with a lot of hard work, with the same passion and commitment.

 Trump Tries To Tie Chuck Schumer To Putin With Insane Twitter Fit (IMAGE),"It is becoming clearer and clearer that Donald Trump and the people around him have serious ties to Vladimir Putin and Russian operatives. On top of that, the story regarding Trump s Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, meeting with the Russian Ambassador and lying about it under oath completely stepped on what could have been a good news cycle after a surprisingly semi-normal speech delivered to a joint session of Congress. So, what does Trump do in retaliation? Why, he takes to Twitter, of course.First, Trump insisted that it was  illegal leaks  and  fake news  that was the REAL story, not Sessions s shading dealings with the Russian Ambassador and his lies regarding said dealings. When that tactic didn t kill the story, Trump tried an even more insane approach, and tweeted a 13-year-old photo of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) with Vladimir Putin.This approach makes no sense at all, considering that Team Trump keeps saying that there s absolutely nothing wrong with people in Congress meeting with foreign diplomats and leaders, be they adversaries or otherwise. However, Trump plowed on, and tweeted the following:So, let me get this straight. Trump s people   and let s face, it likely Trump himself   wants a decade- plus old photo of Chuck Schumer with Vladimir Putin investigated, but wants the investigation into his people s dealings with Russian operatives during a presidential campaign that everyone knows was compromised by Russia dropped? That s rich.Don t fall for it, folks. This is nothing but a ridiculous distraction. Where there s smoke, there s fire.

In short, American intelligence gathering efforts against ISIS and Russia have just been seriously compromised.Outrage immediately ensued after the story broke, with both Democrats and Republicans expressing concern over Trump s actions. The optic are also terrible in light of the fact that Trump is embroiled in a growing scandal involving Russia and had fired FBI Director James Comey the day before the meeting.Of course, Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to defend his actions, ending his rant by whining about leakers despite the fact that he leaked highly classified information to the Russians.As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining .

"Justice Department, ex-Obama lawyers duel over Arpaio pardon","(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday said a criminal conviction against ex-Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio should be dismissed as moot in the wake of a controversial pardon from President Donald Trump, according to a court filing. However several legal groups, including one staffed by lawyers who worked for President Barack Obama’s administration, urged an Arizona federal judge to deem the pardon an unconstitutional overreach of executive authority. Trump, a Republican who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, has praised Arpaio’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants in Arizona’s Maricopa County which drew condemnation from civil rights groups. Arpaio was convicted in July of willfully violating a 2011 injunction barring his officers from stopping and detaining Latino motorists solely on suspicion that they were in the country illegally. He had not yet been sentenced when Trump issued the pardon last month. Arpaio asked U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton in Arizona to vacate the verdict and all other orders in the case. The Justice Department on Monday said his request was valid. “The presidential pardon removes any punitive consequences that would otherwise flow from [Arpaio’s] non-final conviction and therefore renders the case moot,” it wrote in a court filing. The Protect Democracy Project, an advocacy group that includes the Obama administration lawyers, filed a separate brief urging Bolton to first decide whether the pardon was constitutional before dismissing the case. It was joined by the Coalition to Preserve Protect and Defend, a legal group consisting largely of government attorneys, and other legal advocacy organizations. Trump’s pardon will remove the ability of the courts to enforce its own orders, the coalition argued. “The result would be an executive branch freed from the judicial scrutiny required to assure compliance with the dictates of the Bill of Rights and other constitutional safeguards,” the group wrote.  Arpaio campaigned for Trump in 2016 and investigated unfounded claims that Obama was not born in the United States, a falsehood that Trump also espoused for years. “Sheriff Joe is a patriot. Sheriff Joe loves our country. Sheriff Joe protected our borders,” Trump said last month. “So I stand by my pardon of Sheriff Joe, and I think the people of Arizona, who really know him best, would agree with me.”",politicsNews,"September 13, 2017 ",1,2460
"Mueller, New York attorney general cooperating on Manafort probe: Politico","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its investigation into President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, Politico reported on Wednesday. Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, Politico reported Mueller’s team, which is investigating possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, and Schneiderman’s aides have shared evidence and talked frequently about a potential case in recent weeks. The cooperation “could potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trump’s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes,” Politico reported. CNN reported on Tuesday that Mueller had issued subpoenas to an attorney who formerly represented Manafort and to a Manafort spokesman. Manafort’s Virginia apartment was raided by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month. The longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with Mueller’s work have said. Politico said no decision had been made on whether to file charges, and quoted one of the sources as saying “Nothing is imminent.” Mueller’s team has been looking into Manafort’s lobbying work and financial transactions, including real estate deals in New York. Manafort, who headed Republican Trump’s campaign for several months in 2016, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in May that Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey threatened the integrity of the agency. Trump has called Schneiderman a “lightweight.” Russia has denied any meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as political witch hunt. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2017 ",1,2041

We re told she took steps to send Children s Hospital money but didn t send it because she and Johnny began squabbling over the settlement deal.As we reported, Amber s lawyer, Pierce O Donnell, says he s confident the settlement will be signed this week.During the campaign, the ACLU described Trump as a  one-man Constitutional crisis,  and warned that his  statements and policy proposals would blatantly violate the inalienable rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The ACLU was one of the first organizations out with a strong statement against Trump after he won the 2016 election:President-elect Trump, as you assume the nation s highest office, we urge you to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. These include your plan to amass a deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants; ban the entry of Muslims into our country and aggressively surveil them; punish women for accessing abortion; reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture; and change our nation s libel laws and restrict freedom of expression.These proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed, they are unlawful and unconstitutional. They violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

Kurdish rebel leader Talabani sought Iraqi unity as president,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, who died on Tuesday aged 83, spent decades fighting for his people s independence but then became president of Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and struggled to unite the deeply fractured country. His death, in Germany, came barely a week after the Kurds of northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly for independence in a referendum condemned by Baghdad and Iraq s powerful neighbors Turkey and Iran who fear it will destabilize the wider region.      A veteran of the Kurdish guerrilla movement, Talabani survived wars, exile and political infighting among the Kurds to become Iraq s first non-Arab president in 2005, two years after the U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam. The Iraqi presidency post-Saddam is a largely ceremonial post, but Talabani, forceful yet charming, proved a pivotal mediator among Iraq s fractious Shi ite, Sunni and Kurdish parties, and he stayed on as head of state until 2014. Despite his calls for Iraqi national unity, the man known affectionately among Kurds as  Mam    or uncle   was always a fierce champion of the Kurdish cause, fighting Saddam for decades and pushing for federalism to benefit the semi-autonomous region in the north. While sectarianism and attacks by al Qaeda engulfed most of Iraq after 2003, triggering a civil war between Shi ites and Sunnis, the Kurdish north remained relatively stable and safe. Iraq s Kurds are now closer than ever to realizing their dream of independence after decades of oppression under Saddam Hussein, followed by years of tensions with the Baghdad government over oil and other issues. However, Talabani s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) - and his wife and companion in political struggle, Hero - voiced only lukewarm support for the Sept. 25 referendum. Talabani was too ill by then to comment publicly on the vote. The referendum was organized by Talabani s longtime rival Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The split between Barzani s Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and Talabani s PUK raises questions over the future of Iraqi Kurdish politics. Talabani s PUK, unlike Barzani, has traditionally good ties with Tehran. Iranian-backed Shi ite groups wield considerable power in Iraq.  Born in 1933, Talabani studied law at Baghdad University,      joined the KDP in 1946 and by his mid-twenties was a member of the inner circle, a top lieutenant to the independence movement s patriarch, Mullah Mustafa Barzani. He split from the party and formed the PUK in 1974. A damaging rivalry developed with Barzani and his son, Massoud. Talabani regarded himself as a modern, socialist and urban alternative to the tribal authority wielded by the elder Barzani and much of the PUK s support comes from the urban elite. Talabani s harshest lesson came in 1988 when Iraq gassed Kurdish towns near the Iranian border during an Iranian-PUK offensive in the waning days of the Iran-Iraq war. In the brutal seven-month Anfal campaigns, Kurds accused Iraqi forces of killing tens of thousands of men, women and children and relocating many more. Many remain missing, despite the discovery of mass graves, and no one knows for sure how many were  Anfalised  as Kurds call the killings and disappearances. Most independent estimates put the figure at about 100,000. Many Kurdish leaders put it at more than 180,000. Following their uprising against Baghdad after the 1991 Gulf war, Iraqi Kurds saw their first shot at self-rule go up in smoke when Talabani and Barzani sparred over control of a provisional north Iraq government elected in 1992. That bickering escalated into a civil war that saw the KDP enlist Baghdad s help against the Iranian-backed PUK.  A U.S.-sponsored truce backed with the threat of a diplomatic embargo took hold in 1998 and the two factions developed parallel, cooperating administrations. Talabani s speeches often reminded Kurds of their suffering at the hands of Saddam Hussein. But he and other Kurdish leaders faced unrest from Kurds more concerned with poor services in their towns and villages than the painful past.

Obama says urges a wait-and-see approach on Trump proposals,"LIMA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Sunday said that people should take a “wait-and-see” approach on President-elect Donald Trump as the real estate mogul works to assemble his choices for senior administration posts. Obama said he could not guarantee Trump would not pursue the policy positions he took during the campaign, but said the realities of the White House would force him to adjust how he approaches many issues.

 Anthony Weiner’s Alleged Teenaged Victim Is P*ssed – At Comey,"For the first time, in recent memory at least, the FBI has decided to put its thumb on the scale of the presidential election by releasing maybes, leaks and innuendo against Hillary Clinton. While a parade of people both on the left and right have railed against the head of the FBI, James Comey, the most powerful voice has been from one of the key figures involved in the so-called investigation: Anthony Weiner s alleged teenage victim of sexting.According to Comey, the FBI has  learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.  Comey didn t say Clinton is being indicted. He didn t say she was even involved. He hasn t even seen the emails that may or may not implicate Clinton. It s guilt by possible association with something that might exist, and all of this bunch of nothin  came out just days before the election.The alleged victim of the sexting that is at the center of the controversy wrote an open letter (printed in Buzzfeed) that raked Comey over the coals. She s upset that she s being re-victimized to become a political tool. Here are some excerpts:In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my  story.  Why couldn t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle?In his  cooperation  with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda.I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters  phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. ..The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It s time that the FBI Director puts his victims  rights above political views.The girl, who appears to be exceptionally articulate and more informed than the majority of voters on both sides of the aisle, signed the letter,  Girl that lost her faith in America.  She s not alone. This election has been one of the most bitter and contentious and fact free (on the Republican side) in our nation s history.

"OBAMA’S SOLDIERS Cause 5-Hour SHUT DOWN On St Paul, MN Interstate…Throw Molotov Cocktails…Concrete At Cops Head…INJURE 21 Cops In Attempt [VIDEO]","Whoever thought asking Obama s terrorists soldiers to shut down highways, throw Molotov cocktails, bricks, concrete and fireworks at innocent human beings who risk their lives every day to keep our cities and towns safe would be a good idea, should really reconsider. There hasn t been this much anger or distrust between Americans in decades. In the end, this movement will have just the opposite effect the protesters hoped it would have. Police officers will likely stop coming into high crime areas and will instead, allow residents to sort out their own dangerous situations. This movement has completely divided our country into responsible, level-headed Americans vs. angry citizens and illegal aliens who have signed up to be soldiers in Obama s race war and his war on law enforcement in America. Nothing good or positive will come out of this and Obama knows that. But then again, Barack care about the interests of the Americans who elected him. It s all about pushing his radical agenda. Twenty-one officers from various Minnesota law enforcement agencies were injured and more than 102 protestors were arrested as a demonstration on the I-94 freeway in St. Paul turned violent Saturday night, with protestors hurling rocks, bottles, fireworks and bricks at law enforcement officers on the scene.Hundreds of demonstrators began protesting at the Governor s Residence in St. Paul Saturday night over the police-involved shooting death of Philander Castile earlier in the week before heading onto the I-94 freeway around 8 p.m., local Fox affiliate KMSP reported.The interstate was shut down in both directions for more than five hours and the protests eventually turned violent, with demonstrators hurling bricks, fireworks and at least one Molotov cocktail at officers, according to the St. Paul Police Department.

DETROIT: BIKERS SHOW UP In Big Numbers To Defend Kid Rock Against Leftist Protesters [VIDEO],"Leftist agitators showed up tonight at the opening of the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit where Detroit legend Kid Rock was scheduled to open the new home of the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons. The protesters who are likely being organized by the Democrat Party and George Soros are hilariously protesting Kid Rock for speaking out against the unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during our national anthem.

 JFK’s Grandson Obliterates Ted Cruz’s Fantasy That JFK Would Be A Republican Today,"Ted Cruz would like us all to believe that John F. Kennedy would be a Republican today if he were alive. JFK s grandson not only disputed Cruz s claim, he torpedoed it.In an op-ed for Politico, Jack Kennedy Schlossberg repeatedly demonstrated that the Republican presidential wannabe and JFK fanboy is full of bullshit.Cruz has referenced JFK on several occasions throughout his presidential campaign insisting that the late former president would not be a Democrat today, but would instead join the Republican Party. JFK campaigned on tax cuts, limiting government and standing up and defeating Soviet communists,  he said in New Hampshire earlier this week.  JFK would be a Republican today. He stood for religious liberty, and he would be tarred and feathered by the modern Democratic Party. Not so fast, says Schlossberg. As Kennedy s grandson, and as a student of his life, legacy and administration, I find this notion and the suggestion that Ted Cruz is somehow taking up his mantle absurd. Were my grandfather alive today, he d be excited about how far we have come as a nation since 1963, he would feel a sense of urgency about the challenges that lie ahead and he most certainly would not be a Republican. Indeed, according to Schlossberg and the historical record, John F. Kennedy was, and still is, a liberal hero who stood in stark contrast to the conservatives who have overrun the GOP in the present day.For instance, here s Schlossberg on Kennedy s record on science versus Cruz and the GOP. Kennedy gave science and technology the highest national priority with his expansion of the space program. Most of the Republican Party denies climate change and has fought all efforts to address it. And here s Schlossberg on what religious liberty meant to JFK. Kennedy believed in religious liberty and the separation of church and state. He did not believe in the right of elected officials to impose their religious views on others. And considering how JFK was attacked because of his Catholic faith, Schlossberg pointed out that  he would be horrified by the attacks made against Muslim-Americans by leading Republican candidates for president. Schlossberg didn t stop there either. He continued to obliterate Ted Cruz s fantasy of a Republican JFK even further.On voting rights: He championed legislation to ensure that all Americans could exercise their right to vote. He did not spend his time devising ways to disenfranchise certain segments of the population. On immigration: As a senator and president he supported immigration reform that would welcome more hopeful men and women to America s shores. He did not try to close our borders, demonize foreign nationals or separate families by deporting parents with American children. Even JFK s stances on foreign policy differ from Cruz s by a wide margin.When it came to projecting American strength and power around the globe, JFK  didn t substitute bluster and bombast for statesmanship and resolve,  and he certainly  did not propose a perpetual war footing or unilateral displays of force. JFK would be particularly pleased about how President Obama has used diplomacy to reach common ground with Iran and Cuba and Schlossberg called out Cruz by name for irresponsibly forcing a government shutdown in 2013 and leading the constant obstruction in the Senate as things his grandfather would despise. Kennedy believed government could help organize the best of America s energies and skills. He created new federal programs with ambitious goals, such as the Peace Corps. He did not spend his years in the House and Senate devoted to obstructing the opposition. He certainly did not lead an effort, as Cruz did, to shut down the federal government to score political points and deny health insurance to millions. And in a final knockout blow to Ted Cruz, Schlossberg described how if the Texas senator had listened carefully to JFK s nomination speech in 1960, he would know that his claim about Kennedy being all about lower taxes, talking tough to the Soviet Union, and supporting limited government is totally wrong. As it turns out, Kennedy admitted that taxes would not always be low because it would take everyone chipping in their fair share to make government work better for everyone and promised that he would not deliver harsh rhetoric against the Soviets.  Clearly, Cruz hasn t read that speech,  Schlossberg wrote.In conclusion, Schlossberg said,  Today, my grandfather would be 98 years old. He d have no idea how to use a cell phone, and he d be shocked by just how far the Republican Party has lost its way. It s safe to say that Ted Cruz should probably keep his damn mouth shut the next time he thinks about bringing up John F. Kennedy as an example of a president who would be a Republican today.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"January 22, 2016",0,4892
Which ‘La Raza’? Trump comments cause confusion over group's role,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s attacks on a federal judge of Mexican heritage have ignited hundreds of postings on social media about an advocacy group for Latinos that some Trump supporters are calling a terrorist organization. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has said that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, an Indiana native whose parents are Mexican immigrants, is making unfair rulings against him as the presiding judge in a class-action lawsuit over Trump University because of his plans to crack down on illegal immigration, including a promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. As evidence of what they say is Curiel’s bias, Trump and some of his supporters have pointed to the judge’s membership in La Raza Lawyers of San Diego, a local group for Hispanic lawyers that is affiliated with the Hispanic National Bar Association. Some Trump supporters have incorrectly linked La Raza Lawyers to the National Council of La Raza, a 50-year-old civil rights group that has been strongly critical of Trump’s proposals on immigration, as well as his idea to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.  The NCLR’s non-profit designation bars it from engaging in political campaigns, and the group’s website describes it as a “nonpartisan voice for Latinos.”  A conservative blog, GotNews.com, first noted Curiel’s membership in the lawyer’s group, which it identified simply as “La Raza,” on May 31. A day later, another conservative website, The Daily Caller, made a link to the NCLR. After the NCLR was first named, Trump fans on Twitter began attacking it. “Judge #TrumpHater #GonzaloCuriel is a member of the #TERRORIST group #LaRazza #BANLaRazza #GonzaloCuriel #RESIGN,” wrote a user @WillysBaldSpot, whose profile describes her as a Trump supporter.  “I would never have known the “La Raza” organization existed without Trump’s controversial comments. #genius,” wrote @asamjulian, another self-proclaimed Trump fan. Trump on Sunday repeated his attack on Curiel in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “He’s a member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he’s got bias,” Trump said in the interview.  “This judge has treated me very unfairly. He’s treated me in a hostile manner, and there’s something going on,” he added. The words “La Raza” translate from Spanish to mean “the race,” which Trump fans cite as proof the NCLR is a group of people who hate anyone who isn’t Hispanic.  Lisa Navarrete, an NCLR spokeswoman, rejected that interpretation, saying that “thousands” of groups had names that included “La Raza” as a “nod to our common heritage.” The attacks on the advocacy group are the latest signs of the increasing racial tension in the 2016 presidential race. Critics have said Trump’s calls to deport undocumented immigrants and ban Muslims amount to racism. His supporters say he’s defending the country from terrorism and violence.  Some supporters of the New York businessman have blamed the NCLR for the violent clashes between anti-Trump protesters and Trump fans at a San Jose, California, rally last week. “Thank you La Raza for putting California into play for Trump,” wrote another supporter, @magnifier661. “Your violent fascism turned off the voting class #MAGA (a hashtag meaning Make America Great Again).”  The NCLR has been criticized in the past for its leaders’ statements on immigration - the group supports a path to citizenship for people who entered the United States illegally - but Navarrete said it has never before attracted the ire of a presidential candidate.  Over the past week, she said, she and other NCLR officials have been calling journalists and pundits they believe are mischaracterizing the group.  “We’ve been doing a lot of correcting the media and making sure they’re not repeating what supporters of Mr. Trump are saying,” she said. “We’re sitting around arguing the minutiae of banking regulation, not running around in hoods.’” Hope Hicks, Trump’s spokeswoman, declined to comment.

"Turkish ex-coastguard commander, 24 others jailed for life in coup trial","ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Friday sentenced 25 people, including a former coastguard commander, to life in prison for trying to overthrow the government during a failed coup last year, state news agency Anadolu reported. Prosecutors had charged 28 people over incidents at a naval base in the northwestern province of Kocaeli on July 15, the night of the coup attempt. Three suspects were acquitted. The Ankara court named the coastguard commander as Hakan Ustem. The trial was one of the first in a series of cases against people accused of involvement in the failed putsch, in which more than 240 people were killed when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, warplanes and helicopters and attacked state institutions including parliament. Earlier this month, a court found 42 former soldiers guilty of trying to kill President Tayyip Erdogan during the coup, handing most of them life sentences. The government blames the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan, for orchestrating the failed coup.  Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement and condemned the coup. ",worldnews,"October 27, 2017 ",1,1230

Congressman wants Homeland Security to address SAT cheating overseas,"(Reuters) - A U.S. congressman called on the Department of Homeland Security to address whether foreign students are cheating on the SAT to get into American universities and illegally qualify for U.S. visas.  In a letter dated Wednesday and sent to the Homeland Security department, Representative Matt Salmon cited a March report by Reuters that detailed “the widespread practice of strategic cheating on the SAT by test preparation centers in Asia” and what he termed the “passive approach” of the test’s owner – the College Board – to stop cheating overseas.   Salmon, a Republican from Arizona and a member of a House committee on education, wrote in the letter that “certain foreign students could fraudulently gain the upper-hand in college admissions by high test scores due to being prepared by these dishonest test-prep centers, thus limiting the options of those students who took the test honestly.” Thousands of U.S. colleges use the standardized test to help select applicants. “I am concerned that under-qualified students are being admitted to U.S. schools under false pretenses,” Salmon wrote.  About 761,000 degree-seeking foreign students currently study in the United States, according to the Institute of International Education. “With such a generous foreign student system,” Salmon wrote, “it is important that we take every effort to ensure its integrity.” Homeland Security requires visas for international students to study in the United States.  A prospective student must be admitted to a U.S. school before applying for a student visa, and Salmon asked the department whether it had “any estimates on how many students may have entered the U.S. with faulty test scores.”  In an interview Thursday, Salmon said that he wants to ensure that “we’re not encouraging a bunch of cheats to come and study in our schools.”  The College Board, the New York-based not-for-profit that owns the SAT, did not respond to requests for comment. Gillian Christensen, deputy press secretary for Homeland Security, said the department will respond to Salmon’s letter. In an email, she said the department “is committed to ensuring the integrity of the student visa system, while protecting the freedoms and openness that are the hallmarks of our country.”  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “will aggressively pursue those who seek to exploit and corrupt America’s legal immigration system for personal gain,” Christensen wrote. Reuters reported in March that the College Board has often reused tests overseas after first giving them in America months or years earlier, even after some test questions began circulating online. College Board officials have said they are unable to assess how many test-takers have seen actual exam material before taking the SAT. But Reuters found students who had attended test-preparation centers in China and who said they had seen questions ahead of time from SATs they subsequently took. Reuters identified 14 times since late 2013 when parts of an SAT given internationally had been publicly exposed before the exam was given overseas. A confidential PowerPoint presentation, prepared by College Board officials in June 2013, revealed that parts of nine of 18 exams in the organization’s global inventory had been “compromised.” Even so, College Board officials confirmed that some portions of those tainted tests were later administered overseas.  In his letter to Homeland Security, Salmon wrote: “I was greatly disturbed by recent news reports regarding The College Board’s passive approach to preventing and addressing cheating on the SAT test abroad.” ",politicsNews,"April 28, 2016 ",1,3680
Mauritanian blogger who faced death penalty for apostasy to be freed,"NOUAKCHOTT (Reuters) - A Mauritanian blogger condemned to death in 2014 for apostasy in a Facebook post about Islam will be freed because an appeals court on Thursday overturned his sentence, his lawyer said.     Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir has spent nearly four years in jail after a high-profile case surrounding a post in which he criticized the use of religion to justify social discrimination.  The case has highlighted tempestuous social divisions in the desert West African country, often based on ethnicity. Thousands protested in the capital Nouakchott and other cities during the trial demanding Mkhaitir be put to death.  Mauritania has not carried out a death penalty sentence since 1987, but last year a group of influential Muslim clerics urged authorities to apply the harshest punishment.  The court reduced Mkhaitir s sentence to two years in prison and a fine of 60,000 ouguiyas ($170). He will be allowed to go free because of time already served in prison, his lawyer Me Mohamed Ould Moine told Reuters.   This is a great victory for Mauritanian justice,  Moine said after the appeal hearing in the northern city of Nouadhibou.  The judges respected Mauritanian law taking into account his regrets and repentance.  The streets of Nouakchott were calm immediately after the hearing, though there was extra security in place there and in Nouadhibou. His lawyer and rights groups have expressed concerns about Mkhaitir s safety following death threats to him and his friends. ",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",1,1567

Republicans push ahead with tax bill as Democrats sharpen attacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers on Monday began revising their proposed overhaul of the U.S. tax code, as Democrats pointed to the loss of popular deductions as proof the legislation was an assault on the middle class. A draft bill unveiled last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives, if enacted, would be the biggest restructuring of the tax system since the 1980s and the first major legislative victory of the Trump presidency. One of the first changes agreed to on Monday, related to carried interest, would go toward fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises.  Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House tax-writing panel, offered to make smaller portions of Wall Street financiers’ income eligible for a lower capital gains tax rate.  It was one of many revisions that are expected as the House Ways and Means Committee amends the tax bill. Brady pledged to lawmakers that they would have a chance to propose their own changes. “Let me assure you this is the beginning of the tax reform process,” he told the committee. Although Republicans generally support the bill’s broader themes, including a sharp cut in the corporate income tax, there are rumblings of dissent over other elements, including repeal of the deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments. New York, California and other high-tax states would be hard hit by the removal of that deduction, a fact seized upon by Democrats to bolster their argument that Trump’s plan is a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the corporate sector. “There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who will be big losers under this bill,” Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said as the tax-writing panel convened to consider the bill. An analysis of how taxpayers would be impacted by the bill from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center issued on Monday was later withdrawn due to an error. TPC said that its analysis contained an error related to a proposed child tax credit and that it would release a revised version as soon as possible. The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs.   The linchpin of the plan is the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and establishment of a 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses, which currently pay income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent. With Democrats united in opposition to the plan, Republican defections from a few traditionally Democratic-leaning states could be enough to torpedo it in the House.   Brady has already agreed to retain the deduction for property tax payments up to a cap of $10,000 as part of a SALT compromise and has said he would be open to raising it. Brady’s carried interest provision would lengthen to more than three years from one the amount of time Wall Street financiers must hold assets in order to be eligible for a lower tax rate. Carried interest is a share of an investment fund’s profits – typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors – that goes to the general partners of private equity, venture capital and hedge funds. Under current law, high-income fund partners pay the long-term capital gains rate of 20 percent on their carried interest income, instead of the 39.6 percent individual tax rate that applies to the ordinary wage income of high earners.   Securing congressional passage of the tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. Investors are adding to the pressure. The expectation of deep tax cuts has helped fuel a stock market rally during Trump's time as president, with the broad S&P 500 index .SPX up about 14 percent. The Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 majority, is developing its own version of the tax legislation, which would have to eventually be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to Trump for signing. Several Republican senators have said they would have a problem voting for any tax bill that significantly increased the deficit. The House bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. Fitch Ratings said on Monday that the House bill could add to the fiscal strain in some states and local jurisdictions by limiting their tax-raising flexibility. Republican leaders are pushing for the House to vote on a revised tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. They have said a draft Senate bill could be ready at the end of this week. The Republican tax plan was devised without Democratic input. The last major tax restructuring, Republican former President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 overhaul, received significant input and support from Democrats. ",politicsNews,"November 6, 2017 ",1,4949
Possible Trump VP pick says he supports abortion rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, under consideration by Republican Donald Trump as a possible vice presidential choice, said on Sunday he favors a woman’s right to choose whether to have an abortion. That stance places Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, at odds with the official Republican Party position, which is firmly anti-abortion. Asked about his position on abortion on ABC News’ “This Week,” Flynn, a registered Democrat, said “women have to be able to choose” and that women “have to make the decision because they’re the ... ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not.”  Trump, the presumptive Republican White House nominee, has said he will pick his vice president before the party’s nomination convention opens on July 18. Flynn has been an adviser to the Trump campaign since early this year.  The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Trump is becoming increasingly infatuated with Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012-2014 under President Barack Obama, because he believes national unrest and the threat of terrorism may demand a “tough and steady” presence on the ticket.  As a businessman and real-estate developer, Trump also likes the idea of teaming up with another non-politician, the Post reported. For weeks Trump has conducted a high-profile canvassing of Republican political stalwarts as part of his running mate search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a military leader would bring to the ticket. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters on Saturday that Flynn had emerged as a possibility. According to the source, Flynn is seen as someone who would be able to help Trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from Islamic State militants. Trump is also considering more conventional vice presidential contenders, such as former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Senate Republicans appear to have votes to pave way to tax reform,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans appeared to have enough votes on Wednesday to pass a budget measure that is crucial to President Donald Trump’s hopes of enacting tax reform legislation before the end of the year. Senate Republican whip John Cornyn, who is in charge of marshalling votes for legislation, said he expected the fiscal 2018 spending blueprint to draw the support necessary to unlock a legislative tool enabling Republicans to move a tax reform bill through the Senate without help from Democrats. Asked if Republicans had enough votes to pass the budget measure, Cornyn told Reuters: “I believe we do.” The resolution requires approval from at least 50 lawmakers in the 100-seat chamber, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate is expected to vote on the budget resolution on Thursday. Republicans control the Senate by only a 52-48 margin, and with Democrats largely opposed to Trump’s plan to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals, Republicans can afford to lose few votes among their own. A budget approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives would allow Republicans to use a procedure known as reconciliation to move tax legislation through the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes normally required. Republican Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal hawk, has threatened to vote against the measure. But Republicans would need to lose three votes for the measure to fail, and there did not appear to be two other Republicans opposing the resolution. On Wednesday, Republicans voted down Democratic amendments to prevent tax cuts for wealthy Americans and protect funding for the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for the elderly and the poor.  Earlier on Wednesday, Trump talked with 18 members of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, including Republicans and five Democrats who are up for re-election in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. The White House hopes those Democrats will be open to working with Trump. It was the latest White House attempt to recruit Democratic support to ensure that tax reform does not meet the same fate as Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, which failed in the Senate when Republicans could not muster enough votes. Trump and top Republicans insist that the tax plan would benefit the middle class.  Analysts argue that wealthy Americans would benefit most. On Wednesday, the left-leaning Center for American Progress released a report saying that Trump personally would get $23 million a year from a proposed business tax cut, while his heirs and heirs of his Cabinet members would reap $3.5 billion from the repeal of the federal inheritance tax.   Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, who attended Wednesday’s meeting, said he warned Trump that some middle-class voters would be hurt by the plan’s proposal to eliminate the $4,000 personal exemption and the deduction for state and local taxes.  “Any plan that starts off with the middle class in a serious hole is going to be pretty hard to fix,” Wyden told reporters. Democrats oppose the Republican budget resolution in part because it would allow tax legislation to expand the federal deficit by up to $1.5 trillion over the next decade.

WATCH: REMEMBER WHEN HILLARY SAID She Wasn’t Dropping Out Of 2008 Primary Race…Hinted Obama Might Be Assassinated Before Election [VIDEO],"That Hillary, she sure is a forked-tongued silver-tongued devil. Funny how the media conveniently forgot about the time Hillary hinted she was going to stay in the race despite the effect it may have on Obama s chance of defeating McCain because after all, Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June right before the election.Because suggesting an opponent in your party may be assassinated before the general is apparently okay if you re a Democrat. This week s controversy over comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and the assassination of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by  second amendment people  echoes a flap during the 2008 primary when she mentioned the possibility of someone killing Barack Obama.For those who don t remember the events of eight years ago, the Illinois senator had all but locked down his historic nomination, but former first lady was holding on until June, refusing to concede.

China unveils new leadership line-up with no clear successor to Xi,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party broke with recent precedent on Wednesday, unveiling a new leadership line-up without a clear successor to President Xi Jinping, who has become arguably the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing s Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his  vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage.  Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday. All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China s 1949 Communist revolution. The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world s second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favorable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a  team of rivals . The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party s General Office.  Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March. Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and  Belt and Road  infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party s  core  last year. Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party s so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee. Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee.  He s consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,  said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.   The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn t need to do it.  Wang, who led Xi s sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China s second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior.  While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi s chief of staff as director of the party s General Office.  Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,  said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics.  Most of Xi s close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away.  Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People s Daily s WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a  dream team  to lead China into its  new era . Xi, who has sought to revitalize the Communist Party s role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English. Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations.  We will also work with other nations to build a global community with a shared future, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of peace and development for all humanity,  he said.  Xi and Li were first promoted to the Standing Committee at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, in a clear signal that the pair would succeed Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao and occupy the top two  offices - which they did five years later.  Zhao Leji, who headed the party s Organisation Department, which oversees personnel decisions, replaced Wang Qishan as chief of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

Kenyan police disperse protests against election commission,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police used tear gas and batons on Tuesday to disperse protesters who say election officials should be sacked before the re-run of a presidential vote because they favor President Uhuru Kenyatta. Several volleys of tear gas were fired near the election commission headquarters in central Nairobi, a Reuters witness said. When protestors regrouped, officers fired more tear gas and beat some with batons. By mid-afternoon calm had returned. Raila Odinga, who lost his presidential bid on Aug. 8, will get another chance after the Supreme Court annulled the election citing irregularities and ordered a fresh vote within 60 days. However, Odinga has accused the election commission, known as the IEBC, of being a puppet of Kenyatta s ruling Jubilee party and said he will not participate in the Oct. 26 re-run if election officials are not sacked and prosecuted. The court did not find any individual responsible but said institutional failings had led to irregularities and illegalities in the transmission of election results.  The election commission has asked the opposition to call off protests until the IEBC has explained the various measures being taken to  enhance the credibility and integrity  of the vote.  IEBC cannot begin the process of an honest election as long as those responsible for the irregularities and illegalities are still lurking in its corridors,  Odinga told reporters.  IEBC has refused to dismiss or suspend them. That is why we are today beginning these peaceful campaigns to force them out by public pressure so the process of a fair election can at last begin,  he added. Last week Kenya s chief prosecutor ordered investigations into 11 election board officials including its chief executive, Ezra Chiloba, as well as a lawyer and campaigner who worked for Odinga. Speaking as protestors gathered outside his office, Chiloba said he would not resign.  I have (a) responsibility before me and I have to discharge that responsibility,  he told Kenya s KTN television network. Some Kenyatta supporters also took to the streets in Nairobi but there were no clashes between the two sides. In the port city of Mombasa, a crowd gathered at local election office, chanting:  No reforms no elections. Chiloba must go!  The Kenyan government in a statement accused  mobs of hooligans  of taking advantage of the protests to destroy property and said  a number of criminals  had been arrested and would be taken to court.  Underscoring the rising tensions, a newly elected opposition lawmaker was charged with subversion at a court hearing in Nairobi on Tuesday. Paul Ongili Owino was arrested after a video clip of him speaking while campaigning for Odinga emerged on social media in which he called Kenyatta a son of a dog. The prosecution said those words were  calculated to excite disaffection against the presidency . Ahead of Tuesday s demonstrations by the opposition National Super Alliance coalition, Kenyatta had said violence would not be tolerated.  People are free to demonstrate but they must ensure that they do not destroy other people s property,  he said.  Let them not think that they will break into other people s shops and interfere with the daily routine of other Kenyans. That, we shall not allow,  he said. In the western city of Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold where some 3,000 protestors gathered, one protestor, vegetable market vendor Hellen Aketch said:  I will support anything that assures me of the validity and the safety of my vote in the upcoming elections.   I have closed (my) business today and I am ready to do it again so long as some sanity is realized among those who hold public office.  ",worldnews,"September 26, 2017 ",1,3739
Trump touts Charter hiring that was in works for two years,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday touted Charter Communications Inc’s decision to invest $25 billion in the United States and a plan the company announced before he was elected to hire 20,000 workers over four years. At a White House event with the second-largest U.S. cable company’s Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Trump praised Charter for planning to close its offshore call centers and move them to the United States. Much of the announcement was not new. Charter said last May that it planned to add 20,000 jobs as part of its merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks. As early as June 2015, Rutledge said Charter would need an additional 20,000 employees after those deals. On a number of occasions, Trump has touted job announcements at the White House that had been previously planned or announced  The company said more than a year ago in February 2016 that it planned to close foreign Time Warner Cable call centers and move the jobs to the United States. On Friday, Trump said, “We’re embracing a new economic model - the American Model. We’re going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations - that has started already, big league - reduce government burdens, and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers. “You’re going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs, of companies, and everything coming back into our country.” Charter, which has 24 million residential and business customers in 41 states, said on Friday it had committed to Trump to hiring those workers within four years. It plans to invest $25 billion in broadband infrastructure and technology in the next four years. In May 2016 Rutledge said in a recorded interview there would be some overlap in management positions (after the TWC merger) but said the company would hire about 20,000 people over four years.     Rutledge said the broadband investment was being made “in the right regulatory climate and right tax climate ... We’re committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country.” Charter agreed in May 2016 to make significant broadband  investment under a deal with the Federal Communications Commission that was part of winning approval to acquire the cable networks. At that time Charter agreed to extend high-speed internet access to another two million customers within five years, with one million served by a broadband competitor. Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement on Friday that the commission was “working to set rules of the road that encourage companies to build and upgrade broadband networks across the country.” He credited the FCC’s “investment-friendly policies” in part for Charter’s commitments. The agency is considering a petition by the American Cable Association to strike the requirement Charter extend service to areas already served by companies because it could harm smaller competitors. Charter also touted its plans to open a new bilingual call center in McAllen, Texas and said it expects to employ 600 there by the end of 2018. Plans to open a call center in Texas were announced last October.   In December, Trump announced that telecommunications group Sprint Corp and U.S. satellite company OneWeb would bring 8,000 jobs to the United States, and the companies said the positions were part of a previously disclosed pledge by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. In January, Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said of its decision to shift 5,000 call center jobs to the United States that the company “had plans to do this for a while.”  ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2017 ",1,3751
Trump nominee clears Senate hurdle to join Federal Reserve,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a private investment firm came one step closer to leading the Federal Reserve’s regulatory efforts Wednesday, a key post as President Donald Trump endeavors to trim regulations to boost economic growth. The U.S. Senate voted 62-33 to limit debate on Randal Quarles’ nomination to join the Fed’s Board of Governors, guaranteeing opponents could not delay his confirmation. Quarles is eventually expected to fill the role of vice chair for supervision at the Fed, making him the top official at the central bank in charge of regulatory issues.     The Senate will vote to name Quarles formally to that post at a later date, after he has joined the Fed board. Quarles is a prominent investor and former Treasury Department official. Trump nominated him in July.     Analysts said the appointment of Quarles and the October departure of Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer, who had spoken out against weakening Wall Street regulations, could accelerate Trump’s deregulation agenda, potentially saving banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) billions of dollars.

 Watch Joy Behar And Trump Supporting Audience Member Go Head To Head (VIDEO),"While many in the United States have come to the logical decision that Donald Trump is stark raving mad, there are still those who apparently have made him their choice for president. One of those people was just in the audience for a taping of ABC s The View and was questioned by host Joy Behar after the show.When the woman who supports Trump (yes, woman) is asked why, she refuses to say why   which if I may add is very Trumpian, because Trump always makes claims with nothing to back it up either   he then explains that she voted for President Obama, but said that it was the biggest mistake of her life. Then she said she works in a hospital and hates Obamacare, even though moments later she said she s been unemployed for a year. She somehow thinks that Trump would actually be better for healthcare and the unemployed. When asked if maybe she should support Bernie Sanders, who wants to provided single payer and a better safety net, she adamantly refused.Now, not to speak ill of a woman who clearly doesn t understand how the parties operate and who stands for what, but it seems she wants to go back to a system that will harm her more than help her. And I think a lot of the blame for her misunderstanding comes down to misinformation and even lack of information being spread by not only candidates, but the media.This woman wants change. Sure. That s great.

U.S. Commerce Secretary wants NAFTA autos content above 70 percent: union chief,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross wants more than 70 percent of North American content in vehicles built in the United States, Canada and Mexico under a renegotiated NAFTA trade deal, the head of Canada s largest private sector union said on Friday. Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, told reporters he suggested in a recent meeting with Ross that the level be raised to 70 percent from the current 62.5 percent, and that the U.S. commerce secretary suggested a  more aggressive  level. Ross has long advocated strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back automotive production from Asia and other non-NAFTA countries. Negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement are in their second round this weekend in Mexico City, where rules of origin are expected to be discussed. U.S. negotiators, however, may not reveal specific rules of origin targets until later rounds, according to auto industry lobbyists.  In fairness to Wilbur, he was more aggressive than I was,  Dias said of Ross  desired North American content level. Dias said he thought that a 70 percent rule would be a step in the right direction for an industry whose jobs have migrated from the United States and Canada to Mexico, and would help shift production of some automotive electronics and other parts from Asia and Europe back to North America. A spokesman for Ross in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment. Dias said tougher NAFTA rules of origin would only be a small part of restoring manufacturing jobs, and that far stronger labor standards were needed to boost wages in Mexico that are far below those in the United States and Canada. He said he agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump s threat to terminate NAFTA if it cannot be improved enough.  NAFTA has been a disaster for workers in Canada, Mexico and the United States. So when he threatens to walk away from it, that s OK. So now we need to reconfigure how we fix things,  he said. At the same time, Dias said that Trump was  not an ally  of unions, describing him as  batshit crazy.  ",worldnews,"September 2, 2017 ",1,2199
 Donald Trump Gives His First Apology Ever And Swears He’d ‘Never Lie To You’,"Donald Trump gave his first ever apology on Thursday. It was half-assed and the work of a teleprompter, but regardless, he did manage to spit out the words. The Republican nominee told the crowd at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina that he  regrets it  if he at times has said the  wrong thing  and  caused personal pain.  At the same time, he said that this should all be excused and ignored because  too much is at stake. As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I ve never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I ve never been politically correct   it takes far too much time, and can often make it more difficult to achieve total victory.Sometimes, in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. Trump then attacked the honesty of his rival, Hillary Clinton, and swore that he would  never lie  and would always put the interests of his voters first. In this journey, I will never lie to you,  Trump promised the crowd. I will never tell you something I do not believe myself. I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours.Trump said that Clinton  has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time,  which is particularly ironic coming from a man who was awarded Lie of the Year by Politifact in 2015. So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day,  he said.So those  wrong things  he has said, the ones he regrets so much, like when he said that all Mexicans are rapists. Yeah, well, that was just him being  too honest.  What a great apology. The best apology.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 18, 2016",0,2041

What would we do without them-they have pushed for the truth on so many things about Benghazi but other things that have happened during the lawless Obama years. Thanks to Judicial Watch for finally getting to the bottom of this!Judicial Watch Docs Reveal Obama Admin KNEW Al Qaeda Terrorists Planned Benghazi 10 Days In Advance (Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained more than 100 pages of previously classified  Secret  documents from the Department of Defense (DOD)and the Department of State revealing that DOD almost immediately reported that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was committed by the al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood-linked  Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman  (BCOAR), and had been planned at least 10 days in advance. Rahman is known as the Blind Sheikh, and is serving life in prison for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terrorist acts. The new documents also provide the first official confirmation that shows the U.S. government was aware of arms shipments from Benghazi to Syria. The documents also include an August 2012 analysis warning of the rise of ISIS and the predicted failure of the Obama policy of regime change in Syria.The documents were released in response to a court order in accordance with a May 15, 2014, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed against both the DOD and State Department seeking communications between the two agencies and congressional leaders  on matters related to the activities of any agency or department of the U.S. government at the Special Mission Compound and/or classified annex in Benghazi.

The document was sent to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Obama White House National Security Council.

OOPS! NEW BREAKING POLLS SHOWS DONALD TRUMP IS MORE POPULAR THAN JOHN MCCAIN WITH VETS,"McCain s war hero status is not in question with the American voter, but his service to our nation as a Senator is clearly an issue Donald Trump leads the GOP presidential field again this week, though controversial remarks about Sen. John McCain may have dented his popularity among RepublicansDonald Trump s rise in the Republican contest for the 2016 presidential nomination doesn t appear to have been slowed much   at least not yet   by the recent controversy over his criticisms of Arizona Sen. John McCain s war record last weekend. In fact, although Trump s favorable ratings among Republicans have declined, he is still ahead   and far ahead   when Republicans are asked to choose among the 16 currently announced candidates.In last week s poll, Donald Trump received the highest favorable ratings of any candidate from Republicans, apparently helped by his tough position on illegal immigration. This week, however, Trump s favorable ratings dropped 11 points, and his unfavorable rating has risen 15 points.DONALD TRUMP AND JOHN MCCAINA separate YouGov poll completed Wednesday suggests a reason why the McCain controversy may not have affected Trump as much as some expected. Two out of three Republicans view McCain as a war hero. But fewer say they have a favorable opinion of him. In fact, Republicans in that poll gave both Trump and McCain similar ratings.The differences between the Trump favorable ratings in the Economist/YouGov Poll and the daily poll are not significant.In addition, while a majority of Republicans (54%) think Trump should apologize for this statement about Trump:  He s not a war hero. He s a war hero  cause he was captured. I like people that weren t captured. OK? Perhaps he was a war hero, but now he s said some very bad things about a lot of people.  32% of Republicans believe he doesn t need to apologize. In fact, more Democrats than Republicans want Trump to apologize.Even more striking, veterans and those currently in the military are more likely to have favorable views of Trump than to have favorable views of McCain. 41% say they have favorable views of McCain, while more than half are favorable to Trump.Veterans are divided on whether Trump owes McCain an apology.While a core of Republicans appear to have coalesced around a Trump candidacy, the New York businessman has yet to cross the threshold of being viewed as a likely winner with many Republicans. More than three times as many Republican-identifying registered voters view Bush as the likely Republican nominee than say Trump is that person. 36% call Bush the likely winner, 11% choose Walker, and just 10% name Trump.Via: YouGov US",politics,"Jul 25, 2015",0,2738
RABID PRO-AMNESTY LEGISLATOR Luis Gutiérrez On Paul Ryan For Speaker “He would work with Democrats in order to solve the problems of America” [VIDEO],"When you re a Republican and get a ringing endorsement from radical pro-amnesty carnival barker, Luis Guti rrez  you should probably re-think your party affiliation Friday on MSNBC, Rep. Luis Guti rrez (D-IL) said Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI)doesn t want to be House Speaker because he would have to work with the  extreme  Republicans who want to take away the rights of gays, woman and minorities.Guti rrez said,  Look, they cannibalize their own. First Cantor, then McCarthy, before that Boehner. That s why Paul Ryan doesn t want to be the Speaker of the House. He doesn t want to be the Speaker of the House because he understands that there are 35, 40 Republican members of the House that didn t come here to govern. They came here to destroy government. They came here to take the government down. They don t want to coalesce and work with the other side of the aisle. They want to take the country backwards. He continued,  Yesterday I was at a hearing, the judiciary committee. What do they want to do now they have a new committee and a new investigation into Planned Parenthood. Why? Because they want to turn the clock back on women. They want women to go back to the  50s and that  Mad Men  series that we watch on cable TV where women didn t have rights. That s what they want to do, and that s why he doesn t want to take on the Speakership. They want to turn the clock back, and they have chaos. Look, if they can t do something as fundamental as pick a new leader, as fundamental as pick a new leader, and every time they pick a leader, they cannibalize that leader. How are they going to lead this nation? Complementing Ryan he continued,  Let me just say this. smartest person, I believe, in the GOP conference and would be good for the country, would be good for the Republican Party, would be good for the House of Representatives   because Paul Ryan is the kind of individual that will work with other people on the other side of the aisle, and I think that that s what need. He added,  He would work with Democrats in order to solve the problems of America and that s exactly what the 35, 40 members, these extreme members, very vocal, organized, extreme members of the Republican caucus don t want. They don t want an American solution. They think, you know what, gay people should go back in the closet, women should be at home in the kitchen, and those Latinos and Asians, why don t we just make them invisible again or deport them altogether? That s their philosophy of government. They want to go back before there was a Voting Rights and a Civil Rights Act in America. When I was born in America in 1953, it was separate but equal. But let me assure you, it was separate but not real equal for people like me. That s the America they want to take us back to. and guess what? the vast majority of the American people are going to push back strong against that attempt to take us backwards.

SLIPPERY SNAKE JAMES CLAPPER Resigns In Time For The Era Of Trump…Remember The “Not Wittingly” Moment? [Video],"Remember the famous moment when US NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF James Clapper was testifying about the NSA surveillance of Americans when he let slip a sign he was not being truthful. Of course, we knew this was all a smoke and mirrors show. Clapper later said he  misspoke last we checked it s pretty much the same thing as lying NOT WITTINGLY    JAMES CLAPPERHere s the video below where he parses words in his testimony: Clapper took over in 2010 heading up 17 different intelligence agencies. His tenure was marked by the Edward Snowden leaks on US intelligence. He s always said he d resign at the end of Obama s presidency but we re wondering if he s jumping before Trump appointees arrive. Clapper and Gen. Mike Flynn have a history that s not so perfect:Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some  niceties,  I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me).I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot.I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements.

" Marco Rubio Really Wants To Win Reelection, But Won’t Rule Out Puling A Sarah Palin (VIDEO)","Marco Rubio hates his job. Last year, he said he wasn t going to run for reelection because he was  frustrated.  He also had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate. Now, Rubio wants his job back, but, as if his voters haven t been screwed enough from him, he won t promise he ll finish his term out.In an interview Tuesday, CNN s Manu Raju asked Rubio if he would commit to serving the entirety of his term, to which the Florida Republican said: No one can make that commitment because you don t know what the future s gonna hold in your life   personally or politically.

Caribbean oil terminals make preparations ahead of Hurricane Maria,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Several Caribbean oil storage terminals that temporarily closed ahead of Hurricane Irma earlier this month have started making preparations in case they have to shut again due to Hurricane Maria, which was a rare Category 5 storm on Tuesday.  Shippers and traders in the Atlantic basin are struggling amid this year s very active storm season, which has seen seven hurricanes so far, four of them major hurricanes, defined as at least a Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. Gulf Coast s energy infrastructure at the end of August, halting a large portion of fuel exports to Latin America. This month, hurricanes Irma and Maria have forced Caribbean oil terminals and refineries to shut or slow operations, locking down millions of barrels stored. The scramble for shipments has led some shippers to divert tankers away from Venezuela to feed Latin American and Caribbean countries desperate for fuel. Maria on Tuesday evening churned in the eastern Caribbean about 60 miles (190 km) southeast of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where a 13-million-barrel oil storage facility is located. Operators of other terminals in neighboring islands were monitoring the storm before making operational decisions. The hurricane brushed north of St. Lucia and its path could also include St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and parts of the Bahamas, islands where most of Caribbean s 100-million-barrel storage capacity is located. NuStar Energy s 13-million-barrel Statia terminal in St. Eustatius remains shut since earlier this month after some of its tanks suffered damage from Irma, according to the company. It also activated a hurricane response plan ahead of Maria. Statoil s South Riding Point terminal in the Bahamas remained open on Tuesday, though the company is monitoring the hurricane, it said in an email to Reuters. U.S.-based Buckeye Partners, the largest terminal operator in the Caribbean, said in an emailed statement that it  initiated full plant shutdown procedures and suspended all marine terminal operations for its operations in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico per our established hurricane preparedness plan.    Buckeye temporarily shut its 23-million-barrel Bahamas terminal, its 6-million-barrel Puerto Rico facility and its Florida pipeline and terminal system earlier in September due to Irma, but all of them were in the process of resuming operations last week. Maria caused  mind boggling damage  in Dominica, where it ripped off roofs across the island before pushing on toward the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday.

North Korean foreign minister heads to Cuba,"HAVANA (Reuters) - North Korea s foreign minister will arrive in Cuba on Monday, in search of support amid unprecedented pressure from the United States and the international community to cease its nuclear weapons and missile programs. The Cuban foreign ministry, in a brief note on its web page, said Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho would meet with his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez, among other unspecified activities. North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapon and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. Cuba and North Korea have maintained warm political relations since 1960, despite Havana s often-stated opposition to nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump has also increased pressure on Cuba since taking office, rolling back a fragile detente begun by predecessor Barack Obama and returning to the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War. The visit provides an opportunity for North Korea to demonstrate, just 90 miles from the United States, that it is not completely isolated, and for Cuba that it will not buckle under U.S. pressure. At the same time, diplomats said Cuba was one of the few countries that might be able to convince North Korea to move away from the current showdown with the United States that threatens war.  We often ask the Cubans if they can talk to them,  an Asian diplomat said. The two Communist-run countries are the last in the world to maintain Soviet-style command economies, though under President Raul Castro, the Caribbean nation has taken some small steps toward the more market-oriented communism of China and Vietnam. Cuba maintains an embassy in North Korea, but publicly trades almost exclusively with the South. Last year, trade with the latter was $67 million and with the North just $9 million, according to the Cuban government. However, in 2013, Panama discovered a load of Soviet vintage weapons hidden under 10,000 tonnes of Cuban sugar on a North Korean vessel, in violation of U.N. sanctions and appearing to confirm suspicions that the two countries worked together to circumvent them. Cuba claimed the weapons were going to North Korea for repairs and were to be sent back. ",worldnews,"November 20, 2017 ",1,2324
 A Top Republican Really Just Blamed Obama For The GOP Baseball Shooting (VIDEO),"Rep. Steve King (R-IA) has been in the news constantly, and it hasn t been good. His most recent stunt will certainly raise eyebrows and even make people wonder if he wants to be re-elected at all, because it is absolutely ridiculous and pathetic.While many Republicans were quick to blame the Republican baseball shooting, in which Rep. Steve Scalise and four others were injured, on Democrats and Liberals, King decided to take it a step further. Reviving one of the most tired, played out traditions of the Republican Party, King blamed the shooting on former President Barack Obama.King made these comments in an interview with Simon Conway on WHO Iowa radio, where King actually had the nerve to accuse Obama of  dividing  the country during his presidency, therefore causing the shooting. King s comments are seriously disgusting, and reflect a GOP that is clearly out of touch with reality and ignoring the fact that it nominated the most divisive presidential candidate to lead the country   Donald Trump. King said: I do want to put some of this at the feet of Barack Obama. He contributed mightily to dividing us. He focused on our differences rather than our things that unify us. And this is some of the fruits of that labor. Unfortunately, Conway was more than happy to join in on the Obama-bashing. Conway said: Of course he also spent eight years telling us all how terrible we all are and what a garbage can America was and how unexceptional we all were. I agree. I absolutely agree with what you said. The GOP has been blaming everything on Obama for the past several years, and the fact that we ve had a new president for months now hasn t stopped them. King s comments are repulsive and incorrect, as he clearly cannot see the amount of division Trump has caused in just a few short months in the White House. You can listen to King s interview below:In contrast, at least Republican Congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) had the brains to recognize that Trump has fueled a toxic political environment, and should carry part of the blame for the baseball shooting.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2017",0,2195
Hong Kong democracy activists granted bail as they seek to appeal against jail terms,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong s highest court granted bail to two prominent young pro-democracy activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, on Tuesday pending an appeal over their jail terms for unlawful assembly linked to the city s mass pro-democracy protests in 2014. Hong Kong s appeals court jailed Wong, 21, Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, leaders of the Chinese-ruled city s democracy movement, in August. Their sentencing came as a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompted accusations of political interference. The trio helped lead the largely peaceful  Umbrella Movement  that blocked major roads for 79 days in 2014, demanding Beijing grant Hong Kong full democracy. Hong Kong has been governed under a  one country, two systems  formula since its return from British to Chinese rule in 1997, allowing freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China that include an independent judiciary. Hong Kong Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, who heads the Court of Final Appeal, granted Wong and Law bail of HK$50,000 ($6,408) each while they appeal against their respective six-month and eight-month jail terms.  There s no flight risk,  Ma told the court. Chow did not apply for bail.  Ma said a Court of Final Appeal hearing would be held on Nov. 7 to consider the trio s applications for appeal. The next legal steps will likely be scrutinised closely, with the jailings having shaken confidence in Hong Kong s vaunted rule of law. Wong, Chow and Law were sentenced last year to community service for unlawful assembly. However, Reuters reported that Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had overruled other senior colleagues to re-open the case and push for a harsher sentence that eventually led to their imprisonment. A group of senior international lawyers recently issued a joint letter saying the jailings posed a serious threat to the city s rule of law.

VANITY FAIR LEAVES MELANIA Off “BEST DRESSED” List…But Look Who Did Make The List,"Immediately following the election, a few leftist designers announced they wouldn t work with Melania Trump. Their decision to not offer their fashion creations to Melania hasn t seemed to have had much of an effect on her. Melania has brought elegance, class and most of all, style back to the White House that we haven t seen since the Jackie Kennedy era.Apparently, Vanity Fair missed the excitement and enthusiasm so many women (and men) seem to have for seeing photos of the always meticulously dressed First Lady Melania Trump, because somehow, her name was kept off their  Best Dressed Women of 2017  list, but several names that appeared on their list have many Americans scratching their heads in disbelief.Melania made her first major fashion statement on the day her husband was inaugurated as our 45th President, where she was seen wearing a stunning two-piece, robin s egg blue, Ralph Lauren suit.Later in the evening, Melania stunned again in a sleek white, off-the-shoulder column dress with a modest slit revealing her toned legs, as she and President Trump danced to Frank Sinatra s  My Way. There have been countless photos of Melania carrying herself with grace, class, and elegance as truly one of the most well-dressed First Lady s in history.Melania stunned the world in her luxurious black pants suit on her first overseas trip to Saudi Arabia with President Trump:Again, Melania pulled off another amazing pants suit on her trip to Saudi Arabia, that even made some of us forget about the damage Hillary Clinton had done to the image of pants suits on women.But Vanity Fair s list apparently is less a list of  well dressed  individuals and couples, and more a list of individuals who lean left. Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s list:Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s  Best Dressed Women  list:Beyonce s sister, (Yes, the same sister who was caught on camera beating and kicking Jay Z in an elevator.) Solange Knowles made the list.  Because why?We don t need to go into the whole love-fest between Solange s much more famous sister Beyonce and the Obama s, do we?And the entertainer Rhianna, who usually looks like she just walked out a freak show, and calls women up to the stage while she s performing to grind on them in front of a packed house, was also named as one of Vanity Fair s  Best Dressed . Did we mention that she was a huge Obama supporter? When she visited the White House, she told her fans that the best part of the visit was that Obama was  black . She probably just forgot that he is also white. Anyhow, it s probably pretty clear why Vanity Fair chose her.Vanity Fair even had a  Best Dressed Couples  category, and to the surprise of no one, the Obama s and the Macron s made the list that should have been renamed the  High Profile People On The Left Who Wear Clothes . Of course, Michelle and Barack made the list. Even funnier, is the fact that Vanity Fair chose this photo to highlight Michelle s great taste in clothing.And then there s the leftist first couple of France, the Macron s. We must concede, that Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron are the only leftists on this list that we believe actually have any business being on a  Best Dressed  list. Like Melania Trump, France s first lady never disappoints when it comes to fashion. Vanity Fair did however mention Melania and her fashion sense in arecent article, but it was anything but flattering, as they attempted to accuse her of copying (of all people) Michelle Obama, as a way to make her more appealing to Americans. LOL!From the Vanity Fair article:Melania Trump appears to be taking a page out of the Michelle Obama book of fashion. The usually designer-clad Trump flew from Camp David to D.C. over the weekend wearing a surprisingly affordable $75 pink gingham shirt from J.Crew along with a pair of matching J Brand pink pants and Manolo Blahnik flats. According to Yahoo Style Canada, the button-up top is a discontinued piece from the brand s 2012 collection. Perhaps she s been waiting to save the economical top for just the right moment in her First Lady reign.The mall brand is a major departure from the First Lady s typical designer wardrobe, which is occasionally criticized for being over the top and out of touch. Trump s predecessor Michelle Obama was often lauded for wearing J.Crew during her time in the White House, coming across as a more relatable and accessible First Lady than many in the past. It seems entirely possible that Trump is ripping out a page from the Obama handbook in order to drum up some much-needed goodwill from the public. ",left-news,"Sep 6, 2017",0,4702

 ‘CLOWN SHOW’: Former CIA Official Takes Shots At Trump’s Team In Hilarious Clip (VIDEO),"Philip Mudd, a former CIA official, totally tore Trump and his future national security adviser, Lt. General Michael Flynn, to pieces during a Tuesday appearance on CNN s  The Situation Room. Mudd had strong words for Flynn especially, saying he was  absolutely not  the right choice.  I m watching a clown show,  he said.CNN has more:Quickly morphing   in his own words   from a  CNN commentator to a former CIA official,  Mudd went on to list a collection of men and women who have previously held the post Flynn is scheduled to occupy, all the while denouncing Flynn s behavior during the recent campaign. We transition now to a national security adviser [Flynn]   in a political realm   who argues that an opponent, on the stump, should be locked up in prison, who argues that a billion plus Muslims should be grouped together. Mudd went on to express his ire at the idea that Flynn s son   Michael G. Flynn   had security clearance requested on his behalf.While it should be noted that team Trump has denied requesting that access for Flynn s son, I have to point out they re already trying to bury the whole incident anyway, and are also liars, so their word is not to be trusted without thorough documentation.As Mudd said, the incoming Trump administration is, indeed, a  clown show.  Unfortunately, it s also a clown show that will be running the entire country, and Flynn is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to swamp monsters on Trump s staff.Here s the video:Former CIA official Phil Mudd goes off on Gen. Flynn: I m watching a clown show! https://t.co/oQC1TEd2bi  The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) December 6, 2016Politico, in their coverage of the segment, touched on some of the issues people are taking with the appointment of General Flynn, saying:  Trump s appointment of Flynn, who has referred to Islam as a  cancer  and argued that  fear of Muslims is rational,  has been challenged by numerous advocacy groups, with 53 organizations recently signing an open letter calling on Trump to rescind the pick. In my own words:Flynn isn t as bad as Trump s other picks at first glance, that is. He seems to have no clue what he s talking about with regard to many political issues, but on the subject of national security, he does at least have some expertise. Unfortunately, that expertise is tempered with a  let s bomb the shit out of everything!  attitude combined with extreme Islamophobia. Lovely. He s also been reported to have a loose relationship with the truth. A leaked email from former Secretary of State and four-star general Colin Powell is even more telling: I spoke at DIA last month,  Powell wrote to his son, Michael, on July 19 before relaying a story he apparently heard from Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the current DIA director.  Flynn got fired as head of DIA. His replacement is a black Marine 3-star. I asked why Flynn got fired. Abusive with staff, didn t listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc. He has been and was right-wing nutty every [sic] since.'  (The Washington Post)Come on, Trump, you can t do better than that? Who am I kidding   of course you can t.Every day it becomes more and more clear: Trump is an authoritarian moron with little idea of how to run a government.

Trump defends tax plan as 'great Christmas gifts' to middle class,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday defended a Republican tax-cut plan against Democratic charges that it favors the rich, saying it will be “one of the great Christmas gifts” for the middle class with just days to go before Congress votes. With a vote on the biggest tax rewrite in three decades set for Tuesday, Republicans were working to ensure party members were holding the line in favor of the legislation against entrenched Democratic opposition. The plan was finalized on Friday after Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker pledged their support. Three Republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a Senate that Trump’s party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and Mike Lee. Passage in Congress would provide Republicans and Trump with their first major victory since he took office in January. “It’s going to be one of the great Christmas gifts to middle-income people,” Trump told reporters at the White House before he boarded a helicopter for meetings at Camp David. “The Democrats have their sound bite, the standard sound bite before they even know what the bill is all about,” he added. The proposed package would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy Americans. Under an agreement between the House of Representatives and the Senate, the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed, but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years. Democrats have slammed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. For months, Trump has touted the bill as a middle-class tax cut. Studies from independent analysts and non-partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately. Trump repeated on Saturday that the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from U.S. companies. The tax plan proposes new rules for repatriating cash held overseas. “This is going to bring money in. As an example, we think $4 trillion is going to be flowing back into the country,” he said. “That’s money that’s overseas that’s stuck there for years and years.” ",politicsNews,"December 16, 2017 ",1,2389

It s actually called  eugenics :  From 1933 to 1945, Nazi Germany carried out a campaign to  cleanse  German society of individuals viewed as biological threats to the nation s  health.  Enlisting the help of physicians and medically trained geneticists, psychiatrists, and anthropologists, the Nazis developed racial health policies that began with the mass sterilization of  genetically diseased  persons and ended with the near annihilation of European Jewry. With the patina of legitimacy provided by  racial  science experts, the Nazi regime carried out a program of approximately 400,000 forced sterilizations and over 275,000 euthanasia deaths that found its most radical manifestation in the death of millions of  racial  enemies in the Holocaust.Rachel Snow, chief of population development for the United Nations, intervened. I would take issue with the idea that we do anything to incentivize fewer children or more child.   It s justice and human rights,  she said.  People should have the number of children they want and the timing of children and if some families have five or six children, God bless them, I mean, that s fine. But most people end up with fewer. Another panelist, Montefiore Medical Center director of family planning Nerys Benfield, pointed out that poor and minority women would be disproportionately impacted by policies that penalize parents for  extra kids.

BREAKING: OBAMA-APPOINTED JUDGE ORDERS Vote Recount To Begin At Noon On Monday,"A federal judge has ordered Michigan election officials to begin a massive hand recount of 4.8 million ballots cast in the presidential election at noon Monday.U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith issued a ruling just after midnight Monday in favor of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who sought to let election officials bypass a two-business-day waiting period that would have delayed start of the recount until Wednesday morning.The manual recount process was scheduled to begin Wednesday as specified by state law, and in a rare Sunday hearing in federal court, Goldsmith questioned the harm posed by waiting.Stein s lawyer Mark Brewer argued the case was aimed at ensuring the integrity of Michigan s voting system and that the required waiting period violated Stein s rights to due process and equal protection. He pushed for the recount of 4.8 million ballots to start immediately, which he said would be Monday morning. There are questions raised throughout the country about the integrity of the election system,  Brewer told the judge in front of a courtroom filled with about two dozen people, including state Republican Party Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel.  It s not just rhetoric. The hearing ended Sunday afternoon, with a staffer for the judge saying Goldsmith would issue a written opinion but he did not give a timeline.The deadline to finalize the vote total for the Electoral College is Dec. 13. Chris Thomas, the state elections director, testified Sunday that he could not guarantee that the recount could be finished by that deadline, calling the task  doable but difficult.  Brewer called it  highly doubtful  that the state could finish by the deadline, and asserted the recount needed to start immediately.Read more: Detroit News",left-news,"Dec 5, 2016",0,1842
Hollywood Hip to Al Qaeda: ‘And the Oscar for Best Documentary Short goes to…’," Alex Christoforou The DuranIt should come as no surprise that a film celebrating the White Helmets scooped up an Oscar for best short documentary. Might as well hand the Oscar to ISIS leader Ab  Bakr al-Baghdadi.Far from a humanitarian organisation, the White Helmets are an Al Qaeda staffed propaganda group that is embedded with brutal jihadists looking to overthrow the sovereign government of Syria.Watch this CrossTalk episode to learn who the White Helmets represent  Al Jazeera reports Accepting the Academy Award, director Orlando von Einsiedel urged the audience to stand up and call for an end to Syria s six-year civil war, which led to a standing ovation.Von Einsiedel read out a statement from White Helmets founder Raed al-Saleh, in which he thanked the academy and said the group had saved tens of thousands of lives since it was formed in 2014. We are so grateful that this film has highlighted our work to the world. Our organisation is guided by a verse from the Quran: to save one life is to save all of humanity,  Saleh s statement said. We have saved more than 82,000 Syrian lives. I invite anyone here who hears me to work on the side of life to stop the bloodshed in Syria and around the world.

Republican hold on U.S. state legislatures could slip in election,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Republican Party’s grip on U.S. state legislatures could loosen in next month’s election as Democrats seek to link Republican candidates to the sinking fortunes of the party’s White House candidate, Donald Trump. Republicans, who have dominated control of legislatures since the mid-term election in 2010, currently hold the majority in 67 of the country’s 98 partisan legislative chambers, while Democrats have 31. Nebraska’s single chamber is nonpartisan. More than 80 percent of the nation's 7,383 state legislative seats are up for grabs on Nov. 8 and the race between Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is expected to influence races further down the ballot papers. (See related graphic tmsnrt.rs/2ePmLDI) The bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) estimates 18 legislative chambers in 12 states could switch party control, including in Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Washington and Wisconsin. “More than three-fourths of the time the party winning the White House also makes gains in state legislatures. So the odds are Democrats would pick up chambers and seats on the whole if (Clinton) wins,” said Tim Storey, a NCSL elections analyst. National opinion polls show Clinton leading Trump with just under two weeks to go until Election Day. Democrats are also getting a big boost for down ballot races with Clinton surrogates such as President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and first lady Michelle Obama on the campaign trail stumping for party candidates.  Trump, on the other hand, is openly feuding with Republican leaders, many of whom distanced themselves from the candidate after a 2005 video surfaced earlier this month in which he is heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances. Storey said while Trump has his pockets of popularity, the top Republican on the party’s ticket has become a main line of attack by Democrats in swing districts.  “Instead of taxes or health care or public safety or education, Trump has been an issue in many places,” he said. According to Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which is working to elect Democratic state lawmakers, “Trump is quicksand for legislative Republicans.” But Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), which hopes to spend $40 million on legislative and other state races this election cycle, said the Democrats’ strategy of using Trump to campaign against Republicans is not working. He contended his party’s candidates can win even without presidential coattails. “A good candidate who understands her district, who presents viable solutions for that district in that state has a better than even odds of winning in any type of environment,” he said. In addition to defending legislative turf, Republicans are trying to play offense, targeting 13 chambers in 10 states for seat gains, including Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Vermont, Colorado and Oregon. Post said Democratic candidates are offering voters “a crucial firewall against Republican overreach” in states dominated by Republicans, like North Carolina, where there has been a backlash against a law on use of public bathrooms that critics say discriminates against transgender people.   With all of Minnesota’s legislative seats up for election, Democrats need a net gain of seven seats to take control of the House and turn the state, which has a Democratic governor, in their favor. Larry Jacobs, a University of Minnesota political science professor, said a Democratic sweep could open the way for  legislation funding capital projects and transportation as well as early childhood education. In Illinois, Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, his wife and two of his wealthiest donors have contributed a combined $18 million since the March primary to House Republican leader Jim Durkin and to a super-PAC devoted to chipping away at Democrats’ veto-proof majorities in the state’s House and Senate. Democrats have been in a political stalemate with Rauner for nearly two years over the budget and other issues. In West Virginia, historically a Democratic stronghold state, Republicans took control of the state’s House, Senate, and governor’s office in 2014 for the first time in 83 years. This election, Democrats want the Senate back. Tom Susman, president of TSG Consulting, a Charleston, West Virginia-based government affairs public relations firm, said the likely scenario is the Senate remains Republican, with much of the power ceded to a growing fiscally conservative faction. “Moderate Republicans are in trouble,” said Susman. “We could be looking at a Kansas-like situation. Then, it would basically be the Tea Party running the state Senate. No new taxes. All cuts.” ",politicsNews,"October 26, 2016 ",1,4890
 Conway: Mexico Won’t Pay For The Wall Because They Want To Keep Drugs ‘Pouring’ Into America (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s wall is a stupid, money-wasting idea only an idiot would pay for, but unfortunately said idiot has our nation s checkbook in his hand. Recently, Trump signed an executive order written by white supremacist Steve Bannon that begins diverting taxpayer money   your money   to pay for his gigantic monument to bigotry along our southern border with vague promises that our neighbors will pay for it.Unfortunately for Trump, Mexico didn t get the memo about paying for the wall. More correctly, they got the memo and told President Asterisk to go f*ck himself. After Trump signed his executive order, Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto announced that he was canceling a planned meeting between himself and our petulant child of an alleged President. Mexico does not believe in walls. I ve said it time and time again: Mexico will not pay for any wall, Pe a Nieto said in a video posted Wednesday. He also pledged support for any immigrants herded into the literal concentration camps authorized by Trump s order or who are otherwise mistreated by the United States under Trump s rule.Now, most people would view Pe a Nieto as a man who recognizes the tremendous waste associated with build a wall to keep people out when the trend has been that more Mexicans leave than come into our country for quite some time   or someone who refuses to sign on to such a horrifically bigoted plan. But Trump s propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway has a different explanation   Mexicans are all drug dealers and Pe a Nieto wants nothing more than to keep them flowing into our country from his. Well they don t want it, Gayle, because they want to continue to allow people and I assume drugs, since they re not doing much to stop that, pouring over our borders,  Conway told CBS on Friday. We have to look at America. Mexico should pay for that wall because they get an awful lot from this country through NAFTA and through other monetary disbursements. Conway says that if Mexico doesn t jump on board with Trump s racist plan because we can retaliate easily because  the number one source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back.

WOW! LEGENDARY ACTOR JEFF BRIDGES Sends A Shocking Message To President Trump,"Well, this is a shocker! It takes a brave person to speak up in Hollywood because they could be blacklisted for being supportive of President Trump. We re guessing Jeff Bridges doesn t care what the Hollywood elite thinks because he s been around for decades acting, singing and producing. We love what he had to say about Trump! Who knew he s veteran too!Jeff Bridges played a president in  The Contender,  a political flick released nearly two decades ago in the wake of President Bill Clinton s White House scandals. But when it comes to critiquing the role of today s real-life president, Bridges is a lot more laid back than some of his fellow celebrities. How would The Dude, the character he played in  The Big Lebowski,  handle things? He likely wouldn t be dangling a severed head in the likeness of President Donald Trump, as comedian Kathy Griffin came under fire for. Neither would The Dude joke about killing the president as Johnny Depp recently did. Griffin and Depp later apologized.  Everybody has something different and unique to contribute to society and with different ways of doing it,  Bridges said in an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, after taking part on a panel focused on child hunger at a meeting of the Western Governors Association in Whitefish, Montana.  Some people will be blatantly out there talking about their disappointments and ridiculing the way President Trump is acting,  said Bridges, who supported Hillary Clinton in last year s election.  I m rooting for him to do well by our country,  he said.  I m rooting for him as a human being to do the cool thing. WHO KNEW? JEFF BRIDGES IS A VETERAN! What do Beau Bridges, Jeff Bridges and Lloyd Bridges have in common? Ok  yes  they are all well-known actors  and yes they are all related! But all three have something very patriotic in common!They all proudly served our country in the United States Coast Guard. From left to right: Jeff Bridges (True Grit, The Big Lebowski, Oscar for Crazy Heart) served 7 years in the Coast Guard Reserve. Beau Bridges (The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Fifth Musketeer) served 8 years in the Coast Guard Reserve. And Father to Jeff and Beau, Lloyd Bridges (Around the World Under the Sea, Airplane!, Hot Shots) left Columbia Pictures to join the Coast Guard during WWII. After returning to film acting he then joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary, 11th District in California. Lloyd later did a number of public service announcements for the Coast Guard and was appointed an honorary USCG Commodore.BRIDGES HAS WORKED ON CHILD HUNGER FOR DECADES: Bridges said he is especially concerned about proposed cuts to federal food assistance programs, which he said could harm the well-being of more children. The actor has been an ambassador for  No Kid Hungry   campaign, a national effort to address food insecurity among struggling families. He founded the End Hunger Network in 1983 and became the national spokesman for No Kid Hungry in 2010. Bridges splits his time between homes in Southern California and Montana. He has helped Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and the state s first lady, Lisa Bullock, on expanding school breakfast programs.  The health of our children is a wonderful compass that can tell us if our country is going the right direction,  he said.  That means we re off course, so I m rooting for the president to get on course. Via: AP",politics,"Jun 29, 2017",0,3458

 Republicans Are Admitting They’re Fine With Treason As Long As They Win,"This brings party before country to a whole new level. Republicans are admitting they are fine with treason, as long as they achieve their political goals.That was the message Ann Coulter delivered on her Twitter feed on Friday night.If @realDonaldTrump builds wall, ends O s  executive amnesty,  bans Muslims & deports illegals, he could make Putin VP. #BetterThanReagan  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 22, 2017In fact, Republicans have been demonstrating all year that they don t really care what Donald Trump does as long as they get what they want. So as Trump once said, he could literally murder someone right now in broad daylight and Republicans wouldn t lift a finger to do something about it.What s even scarier is that conservatives like Coulter are also perfectly fine with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin being put in a position of power in the United States government. Of course, we all already know that Putin has power over the government from the outside. Trump is his puppet and he s pulling the strings from Moscow.Coulter goes even further by claiming that Trump is  better  than Ronald Reagan. Keep in mind that Reagan would never have colluded with Russia to win an election. He certainly would not have allowed Russia to dictate what he does as president. Reagan is rolling in his grave right now because of what Trump has done and is doing.As the evidence continues to stack up against Trump, Republicans are just letting him get away with ignoring the Constitution and flouting the law. He has repeatedly lied to the American people, repeatedly obstructed justice, and is using the White House to enrich himself and his family. And they are willing to let him burn down our democracy and humiliate our nation as long as it means they get to enact their political agenda and remain in power.The fact that conservatives like Coulter actually want Putin to be vice-president should scare the hell out of every American, especially those who constantly claim to be  patriots.

Investor Carl Icahn steps down as adviser to President Trump,"(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn ended his role as a special adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday after facing criticism that policy recommendations he offered could help his own investments. Some Democratic lawmakers and biofuels advocates argued that Icahn’s guidance to the Republican administration created a conflict of interest with his businesses, including oil refining company CVR Energy Inc. Icahn has denied any conflict of interest. Icahn’s departure followed a flurry of changes at the White House. Trump on Friday fired his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, two days after disbanding two high-profile business advisory groups. “I chose to end this arrangement (with your blessing) because I did not want partisan bickering about my role to in any way cloud your administration,” Icahn wrote in a letter to Trump released on his website. The White House declined to comment. A call to Icahn’s office was not immediately returned. The activist investor, who leads Icahn Enterprises LP, was an early and close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican for his business acumen. One of Icahn’s first tasks was to vet the future Securities and Exchange Commission chairman and a number of candidates met with the octogenarian investor in his Fifth Avenue office just a few blocks north of Trump Tower in Manhattan. While Icahn stopped managing money for clients years ago, he still has large stakes in companies like Herbalife Ltd , CVR and American International Group Inc , which have faced regulatory issues.     Icahn was so sure Trump’s election last year would give a boost to stocks that he left the campaign’s victory party to make a $1 billion bet on the market, he told Reuters last year. The day after the election, stocks leapt. In his letter to Trump, Icahn downplayed his role as an adviser on regulatory matters, saying “I never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position.” Trump, who came to office promising to roll back regulation, reform the tax code and boost infrastructure spending, never put Icahn on the payroll. But Icahn’s involvement was considerable. He interviewed Scott Pruitt, now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the very agency that would determine regulations about requiring refiners to blend biofuels. His web of financial interests became a lightning rod. “If he was not willing to admit he was a de facto special government employee, and follow the rules, then he had no place serving in government,” said Norman Eisen, co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. “His short tenure, marred by serious conflicts allegations, was yet another black eye for an administration that has become notorious for violations of ethics and the rule of law.” Icahn has been one of the loudest critics of the federal biofuels program, and he was working at price-crushing reforms of the program at the same time he was betting that credits at the center of the program would fall. Biofuels regulations require refiners either to blend biofuels into gasoline or - in the case of companies like CVR that have no blending facilities - to buy credits from competitors. The regulation, the Renewable Fuel Standard, also allows companies to delay those credit purchases by a year. As an adviser to Trump, Icahn urged the president in February to alter the policy to lift the blending burden from refiners. Yet environmental regulators are preparing to formally reject that proposal, sources told Reuters. Investors have built up a large short position in CVR in the past three months, according to Reuters data, as evidence mounts that the company’s gamble on the biofuels market is going sour.

"Singapore bans two Muslim preachers, citing divisive views","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has banned two Muslim foreign preachers from entering the city-state because their views bred intolerance and were a risk to its social harmony, the government said on Monday. The decision to block Ismail Menk, identified by local media as a Zimbabwean and Haslin bin Baharim as a Malaysian, is the latest move by the Singaporean authorities to put a curb on individuals from spreading divisive views. Menk has preached Muslims are not allowed to greet people of other faiths on their religious festivals, Singapore s home affairs ministry said in a statement.  It accused Baharim of holding views that promote discord between Muslims and non-Muslims, whom he described as  deviant.   (Their views) are unacceptable in the context of Singapore s multi-racial and multi-religious society,  the ministry said.  Reuters was not in a position to reach out to the pair. Singapore is predominantly Chinese, many of whom follow Buddhism and Taoism but 14 percent of the population is Muslim and nearly 19 percent Christian.   Authorities in the city-state, an outpost of stability in a region where religious tension is not uncommon, are sensitive to public remarks they deem might adversely affect religious and social harmony. Over the past few years, Singapore increased its level of surveillance for Islamist radicalism as concern grew about the spread of Islamic State in the region. Menk and Baharim planned to conduct religious sessions on a ship departing from Singapore next month after their applications for short-term work passes to preach in Singapore were turned down, the government said.     They will not be allowed to get around the ban by preaching instead on cruise ships which operate to and from Singapore,  the home ministry said. Last month, authorities said they rejected applications for two foreign Christian preachers to speak in Singapore as they had made  denigrating and inflammatory comments of other religions.

 CNN Host Cuts Interview After Trump Supporter PATHETICALLY Tries To Link Hillary To Child Rapist (VIDEO),"On Tuesday morning, CNN Carol Costello completely shut down an interview when a conservative guest (and passionate Donald Trump supporter) went off on a ridiculous rant about Hillary Clinton.The  CNN Newsroom With Carol Costello  interview started to go south toward the end when one of Costello s guests, Trump fan and Newsmax host Steve Malzberg, tried to derail a discussion about the Republican front runner s misogyny and sexist rhetoric by targeting Clinton and her husband. Malzberg bragged about the business mogul s approach with women: When you get one-on-one,   especially if it s Hillary   Donald Trump will go places nobody is willing to go, where the media at this point isn t willing to go. Bringing up Clinton s women who say they were intimidated by Hillary. Having them come forward and speak. A litany of issues that you can t even imagine. Costello interrupted Malzberg and said,  I m thinking that might not be a winning argument for Donald Trump right at this moment.  Which is absolutely correct, considering that Trump has been pummeled for his recent comments that women should be punished for seeking abortions.But Malzberg foolishly continued on, even though Costello s objections were backed up by fellow guest Judson Phillips (who is a Ted Cruz supporter). Malzberg added: Do you know how many young women in this country don t even know that Bill Clinton was impeached? No. Maybe they ve heard of Monica Lewinsky. They don t know the women that have accused Bill Clinton of sexual improprieties and that say they have been threatened and intimidated by Hillary Clinton. Then, Malzberg decided to bring up another truly bizarre talking point   Clinton s involvement in an old child abuse court case from 1975. Malzberg started: A girl who was raped by a pedophile that Hillary Clinton bragged about getting off. Shocked that Malzberg would even mention this, Costello started to shut him down, saying,  Oh, come on. Malzberg cried, Wait, wait, let me finish!  while Costello refused to entertain the conversation. He argued: What do you mean? You don t want to hear it? That Hillary Clinton is on tape bragging about, as a lawyer getting off on a technicality. That woman now says,  Hillary ruined my life.  That s not fair. Costello had had enough of the insane conversation, and said, I m going to leave it there, and goodbye. Thanks for joining me  before ending the interview abruptly. You can watch the awkward moment unfold below, at about the 5:45 mark:In Clinton s memoir, Living History, Clinton addressed that 1975 case, confessing that she had only been out of law school for two years when she was assigned that case. She said that although she  didn t feel comfortable  with the case, she couldn t very well refuse the judge s request.  Clinton knew she had  an ethical and legal obligation to defend him to the fullest extent of the law , and did her best. After that case, Clinton went on to set up Arkansas  first rape hotline.Featured image via screencapture",News,"April 5, 2016",0,3109
"U.S. lifts Sudan sanctions, wins commitment against arms deals with North Korea","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States lifted long-standing sanctions against Sudan on Friday, saying it had made progress fighting terrorism and easing humanitarian distress, and also secured Khartoum s commitment not to pursue arms deals with North Korea. In a move that completes a process begun by former President Barack Obama and which was opposed by human rights groups, President Donald Trump removed a U.S. trade embargo and other penalties that had effectively cut Sudan off from much of the global financial system. The U.S. decision marked a major turnaround for the government of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who once played host to Osama bin Laden and is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of orchestrating genocide in Darfur. However, Sudan will stay on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism - alongside Iran and Syria - which carries a ban on weapons sales and restrictions on U.S. aid, U.S. officials said. Sudanese officials also remain subject to United Nations sanctions for human rights abuses during the Darfur conflict, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The lifting of sanctions reflects a U.S. assessment that Sudan has made progress in meeting Washington s demands, including cooperation on counter-terrorism, working to resolve internal conflicts and allowing more humanitarian aid into Darfur and other rebellious border areas, the officials said. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the sanctions relief was in recognition of Sudan s  sustained positive actions  but that more improvement was needed. The Trump administration also secured a commitment from Sudan that it would  not pursue arms deals  with North Korea, and Washington will apply  zero tolerance  in ensuring Khartoum s compliance, one of the officials said. But they said Khartoum s assurances on North Korea were not a condition for lifting sanctions, some of which had been in place for 20 years and have hobbled the Sudanese economy. Sudan has long been suspected of military ties with North Korea, which is locked in a tense standoff with Washington over its missiles and nuclear weapons programs. But the official said Khartoum was not believed to have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang and that was not expected to change. Sudan also has recently distanced itself diplomatically from Iran, another U.S. arch-foe. U.S. officials have said that sanctions relief, which will unfreeze Sudanese government assets, could benefit a range of businesses in Sudan, including its key energy sector. The economy has been reeling since South Sudan, which holds  three-quarters of former Sudan s oil wells, seceded in 2011.  Sudan looks forward to building  normal relations with the United States,  the foreign ministry said in a statement.  However, this requires lifting Sudan from the list of state sponsors of terrorism because it does not apply (to Sudan).  Central bank governor Hazem Abdel Kader said removing sanctions would allow Sudan s banking system to  reintegrate into the global economy,  and Agriculture Minister Abdul Latif Ajimi said it would bring exchange rate stability that would boost agricultural development, according to state news agency SUNA. Shortly before leaving office, former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily eased penalties against the east African nation. In July, the Trump administration postponed for three months a decision on whether to remove the sanctions completely, setting up an Oct. 12 deadline. Rights groups see the sanctions removal as premature.  It sends the wrong message to lift these sanctions permanently when Sudan has made so little progress on human rights,  said Andrea Prasow, deputy director of the Washington office of Human Rights Watch. Democratic U.S. Representative Jim McGovern said the sanctions decision  legitimizes the murderous actions of the Sudanese government  and warned that  any back-sliding will likely result in Congress reinstating sanctions.  The United States first imposed sanctions on Sudan in 1997, including a trade embargo and blocking government assets, for human rights violations and terrorism concerns. Washington layered on more sanctions in 2006 for what it said was complicity in the violence in Sudan s Darfur region. ",worldnews,"October 6, 2017 ",1,4356
Lawyers evasive about ex-U.S. House speaker's alleged sex abuse,"(Reuters) - Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert’s lawyers declined on Saturday to directly address sexual abuse allegations from federal prosecutors, who asserted that he molested at least four boys decades ago when he served as a high school wrestling coach. Hastert, 74, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced later this month for his guilty plea in October to a federal charge of illegally structuring large bank withdrawals in small increments to evade currency-reporting rules. As part of that plea, the former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives admitted paying $1.7 million in cash to someone he had known for decades as hush money and compensation for unspecified wrongdoing toward that individual. Until this week, neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors had stepped forward to publicly reveal the underlying misconduct at issue. That changed on Friday, when prosecutors alleged in a court filing that Hastert had sexually abused at least four boys on the wrestling team he coached during his time as a teacher at Yorkville High School in the 1960s and ‘70s. Providing details of the alleged abuse, some of them quite graphic,  the prosecutors said Hastert offered massages to students in a locker room, where he had set up an easy chair in view of the boys’ shower, and inappropriately touched some of the students. They also cited an alleged incident that occurred during a wrestling trip in a motel room. Although statutes of limitations bar sexual abuse charges against Hastert, “with this case the government seeks to hold defendant accountable for the crimes he committed that can still be prosecuted,” the court filing said. Asked by Reuters if Hastert or his lawyers would comment on the court filing, a pre-sentencing memorandum, Hastert attorney Thomas Green issued a statement that neither confirmed nor denied the allegations. Hastert “acknowledges that as a young man he committed transgressions for which he is profoundly sorry,” the statement said. “He earnestly apologizes to his former students, family, friends, previous constituents and all others affected by the harm his actions have caused.” The wording closely mirrored a similar expression of remorse contained in a pre-sentencing memo filed by the defense earlier this week. It differed, however, in expressly mentioning “former students.” The defense has asked the federal judge in the case to spare Hastert prison time, citing his deteriorating health, his remorse and years he “dedicated to public service.” Prosecutors have recommended a prison term of no more than six months.  Sentencing is scheduled for April 27. ",politicsNews,"April 9, 2016 ",1,2712
LAVAR BALL: Here’s Why President Trump Was Under No Legal Obligation To Help Release Your Shoplifting Son From Chinese Prison,"Before Lavar Ball, the ungrateful father of accused criminal, and UCLA basketball player, LiAngelo Ball, goes off on a public rant about how unappreciative he for President Trump s help, when he interceded on behalf of his son and 2 other UCLA basketball players, who were caught shoplifting at a Louis Vuitton store in China, he may want to consider, that without the help of President Trump, his son could be sitting in a Chinese prison for the next 10 years.Lavar Ball might also want to consider that President Trump was under no obligation to ask President Xi to get involved in the public relations nightmare that took place while our President was a guest in China, to help negotiate their release, and here s why   Days after President Donald Trump touted his role in the release of three UCLA basketball students who were arrested in China, LaVar Ball, the father of one of those players, suggested the President had little to do with the matter. Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. They try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes.  I m from L.A. I ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses.    LaVar Ball, father of UCLA player with  sticky fingers Law Newz   Our Tweeter-in-Chief lashed out on Twitter Sunday after Ball, a businessman, and ex-basketball player, downplayed POTUS  role in helping release son LiAngelo Ball from Chinese custody.Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017 I should have left them in jail,  Trump wrote. That s a hell of thing to tweet, and it grabbed a lot of attention. Outlets like Mediaite, The NY Times, Fox News, and ESPN were all over it. But as with many things in this administration, it s always helpful to review a president s role in situations like this.To recap, we have three Americans UCLA basketball players LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley arrested by Chinese authorities for alleged shoplifting. Trump took credit for their return to the states, saying he asked the country s president Xi Jinping for help. Now we have that same president saying he should ve done nothing.What does it mean if provable spite motivated a president s decision to refrain from helping an American held in custody on foreign soil? Law&Crime reached out to Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman for his take on the matter and asked if such behavior, or something like it, could be impeachable. Not impeachable,  Feldman wrote in an email.  He was under no duty to help and no duty to be nice about it after the fact. ",politics,"Nov 19, 2017",0,3002
 Meg Whitman Compares Trump To Two Of The World’s Worst Dictators Ever,"The GOP implosion continues, and this time Meg Whitman, failed California gubernatorial candidate, is adding the fuel to the fire.Meeting with Republican leaders at a retreat in Utah, set up by Mitt Romney, Whitman called out House Speaker Paul Ryan over his endorsement of Donald Trump, going as far as to compare the candidate s rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.According to sources who spoke with Politico:At one point, according to two sources, during a question and answer session, Whitman, the billionaire chief executive officer of Hewlett Packard, challenged Ryan over his decision to support Trump. In framing the question, according to the sources, she compared Trump to past historical demagogues including Hitler and Mussolini.In responding to the question, Ryan pointed out that he s criticized Trump in the past. But, as the House Republican leader, he stressed that he had a complex job and had to lead an entire conference.So, in other words, Ryan has no principles and has to act as a sheep for the rest of the tea partiers that have invaded the House of Representatives. It s good to see one Republican expose this truth. Meanwhile, progressives have been saying this for a month now.At the same retreat, Romney told reporters that Trump would usher in  trickle-down racism  should he be elected, echoing Whitman s criticisms that his rhetoric has become over the top.For anyone who might remember, Whitman ran unsuccessfully for governor of California against incumbent Jerry Brown, spending over $140 million of her own money (the most personal money any candidate has used in American history), and lost by 13 percent. In that same election, Carly Fiorina, who would go on to challenge Trump for the GOP presidential nominee, ran and lost to Senator Barbara Boxer.So far, not one Republican has compared Trump to someone like Hitler   until now. And these comments were made in a closed door meeting with high power Republicans. Only God knows what they really say behind closed doors about their precious nominee.Leave it to Meg Whitman to say what the rest of us are thinking, and leave it to Paul Ryan to brush it off and continue being a sheep.Hey, Republicans, how s that unity coming along?Featured image via Andrew Burton",News,"June 11, 2016",0,2340
Arizona execution procedures face review in U.S. court,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Phoenix will hear arguments this week about resuming executions in Arizona, where a 2014 lethal injection that took nearly two hours raised questions about the state’s death chamber protocols and the chemicals it uses to kill inmates. The case is the latest to challenge the drugs used in many states to execute prisoners, and may wind up putting the issue back for review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Arizona last year changed its lethal injection procedures following the troubled 2014 execution of Joseph Wood, but lawyers for seven Arizona death row inmates contend new guidelines and drugs will violate U.S. constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. One issue at the hearing set for Wednesday in U.S. district court will be the sedative midazolam, a valium-like drug critics contend does not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery and is therefore unsuitable for executions. The drug was used in Wood’s execution along with a narcotic, hydromorphone. He was seen gasping for air during a nearly two-hour procedure where he received 15 rounds of drug injections. Lethal injections are supposed to result in death in a matter of minutes. Under the new protocols, Arizona has listed one mix where it will use midazolam along with a drug that causes paralysis and another that stops the heart. A similar combination was used in Oklahoma, which had a troubled execution where an inmate was seen twisting on a death chamber gurney. The state said in court papers filed late on Monday it intends to revise its protocols and remove midazolam as an option, pledging not to use it even if it becomes available. It has three other options for lethal injection mixes that do not use the drug in the new protocols.  Lawyers for the inmates contend the source of the drugs and their purity have been cloaked in secrecy, since European makers and U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc halted sales of drugs used in executions to prison systems in recent years.  As a result, states have turned to lightly regulated compounding pharmacies that mix chemicals. The few states that have obtained lethal injection drugs since then have kept the names of their suppliers confidential. The lawyers want to put future executions on hold while the court reviews the protocols. “Officials in Arizona have fought tooth and nail to protect that secrecy, which, along with the use of an experimental drug combination, only serves to increase the risk of more problematic executions,” said Dale Baich, an attorney for the inmates. The state contends its protocols correct previous problems and it should be permitted to implement capital punishment. “Victims and state governments have rights and interests, too, including an important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence and the state’s interest to enforce its own laws,” David Weinzweig argued on behalf of Arizona at a hearing this year.

Florida governor replaces anti-death penalty prosecutor,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida Governor Rick Scott on Thursday replaced a local prosecutor who declared she would not seek the death penalty in a case against a man accused of killing an Orlando police officer and refused to recuse herself. In an executive order, Scott removed State Attorney Aramis Ayala, the elected prosecutor in central Florida’s Ninth Judicial Circuit, and reassigned the murder case to State Attorney Brad King of the nearby Fifth Judicial Circuit. Ayala, at a news conference earlier on Thursday, said Florida’s death penalty system was the cause of “legal chaos” and said she would not seek the death penalty against Markeith Loyd, charged in the Jan. 9 shooting of the policewoman. He was arrested after an intensive manhunt that drew widespread attention. The statement by Ayala, who took office early this year, outraged law enforcement groups, some state lawmakers and State Attorney General Pam Bondi. But several groups, including Amnesty International USA and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, rose to her defense. “She has made it clear that she will not fight for justice and that is why I am using my executive authority to immediately reassign the case to State Attorney Brad King,” Scott said in a statement. After a discussion with Scott on Thursday afternoon, Ayala issued a statement saying she offered to have “a full conversation” about her decision, but he “declined to explore my reasoning.” “Upon receipt of any lawful order, my office will follow that order and fully cooperate to ensure the successful prosecution of Markeith Loyd,” she said. Florida’s governor signed legislation on Monday tightening state law to require a unanimous recommendation by a jury before judges can impose the death penalty. The law is the state’s latest effort to restart its death penalty process, which was put on hold twice last year after rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Florida Supreme Court in separate cases. Loyd was arrested on Jan. 7 after a nine-day manhunt that followed the shooting death of Orlando police Master Sargent Debra Clayton. At the time, Loyd was already a suspect in the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, in December. Florida prisons hold 382 people who have been sentenced to die. Some have been on death row since the 1970s because the process of appealing death penalty verdicts can take decades.      ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2017 ",1,2450
"The “Brown” The Media Wont’ Cover Because He Wasn’t Killed By A White Cop…Raekwon Juaquay Brown,17 Year Old Hero Sacrifices His Life To Save An Elderly Woman","If his name was Michael Brown if he robbed a local convenience store and roughed up the store manager if he tried to take a gun from the cop who confronted him and was killed by it in the struggle, the media might have covered it. But this was just an innocent 17 year old boy minding his own business when he was faced with the awful decision of whether to risk his own life and save the life of a total stranger or stand back and watch an elderly woman be killed. This hero chose to sacrifice his own life. If we lived in a world where real heroism is not celebrated because it s not controversial. In a good and decent world, Raekwon Juaquay Brown s name would be more of a household name than that of thug Michael Brown. But we live in a world where the Left celebrates victimhood and real or imagined, a good victim can always be used to prop up a cause. #RIP Raekwon Juaquay Brown you are a hero. Seventeen-year-old Raekwon Juaquay Brown sacrificed his life when he pushed an elderly woman out of the way of gunfire before he was slain in Wednesday s daylight shooting near Jeremiah E. Burke High School, the grief-stricken lady told the Herald just hours before a vigil honoring the young hero. He saved my life   I have a new life,  the woman, 67, said in Spanish yesterday while tears streamed down her face. He was only 17. I ve lived here 10 years, I ve never seen anything like this. There needs to be more police here,  she said, showing a wound to her right ankle, where police say she was grazed.The woman was one of four people struck by gunfire in the 1:15 p.m. ambush that left Brown, a Burke High junior, dead. Her name is being withheld by the Herald because she is a witness to the murder.She explained she was in an alley by a pizza shop when the shooting broke out. The teen, who was sitting down eating a hamburger, got up and pushed her to the side by a car, she claimed.Last night hundreds of people, including at least a dozen family members, crowded in front of the market on Washington Street less than a block from the school where Brown fell.Some men turned and walked away in tears while several women dabbed their eyes with tissues from a box that was being passed around. Brown s mother, Wanda Graddy, supported by several relatives, walked toward a memorial for her son, where she cried,  My boy, my boy. The Rev. William Dickerson of the Greater Love Tabernacle Church spoke first and called for the killer to step forward and for witnesses to name him. We pray that justice will come in the midst of this terrible reality,  Dickerson said.Family members said they hope that whoever pulled the trigger will surrender. Stop being cowards,  said Raekwon s older brother, John Brown.  Stand up like a man. Take your consequences. Beside him was the slain teen s godmother, Jacqueline Cane. I just want you to know, whoever did it, turn yourself in,  she said.  You re not going to sleep until you turn yourself in. That was a good guy here. This was my God-baby. Seventeen years old, you took his life. Turn yourself in or you will never rest. Mourners said another prayer and then hugged as they departed.Burke school staff also took time out from the day to recall Brown as a selfless teen. Raekwon was probably one of the most loving and caring students I have ever had in the Sophomore Academy,  said Cheryl Windle, leader for the academy.  He actually had this warmth about him that I really believe captures his true essence. He will truly be missed by all of us here at the Burke community. Lindsa McIntyre, headmaster of Burke, said students and staff will miss Brown dearly.  He came to us as a vibrant, struggling, middle school student, looking for fun and full of vim and vigor. But as he grew in his high school career, he became a metamorphosis for what a real Burke student looks like. Via: Boston Herald",politics,"Jun 10, 2016",0,4009
YOU WON’T BELIEVE Why Students In Communist Wisconsin Are No Longer Allowed To Chant “U.S.A.” At Sporting Events [VIDEO],"This is out of control! Is there anything more un-American than telling high school students they aren t allowed to cheer  U.S.A.!  at a sporting event because they may OFFEND someone from another nation?PLEASE CALL the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association in Stevens Point, WI  Phone (715) 344-8580 Let them know how you feel about their decision to prevent students from chanting  USA!  in the United States Of America!The wussification of Wisconsin has begun.Last month the state s governing body for high school athletics declared that chanting  U-S-A, U-S-A,  is unsportsmanlike behavior.The Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association also directed schools to stop fans from booing, or chanting  Air Ball,   Season s Over,   Fundamentals,   Scoreboard,  and  Over-Rated. Any action directed at opposing teams or their spectators with the intent to taunt, disrespect, distract or entice an unsporting behavior in response is not acceptable sportsmanship,  the WIAA wrote in an email obtained by the Post-Crescent.  Student groups, school administrators and event managers should take immediate steps to correct this unsporting behavior. I should point out that a spokesman for the WIAA told television station WISC that the sportsmanship guidelines are a point of reference and  not a requirement. It s up to each school or district to create their own sportsmanship conduct policies and enforcing them with appropriate consequences,  the spokesman told the television station. Wisconsin s football stadiums, basketball arenas and wrestling mats have become safe spaces for the perpetually-offended generation.Vince Lombardi must be rolling over in his grave.Oh, you should see the 40-page sportsmanship manual complied by the fragile snowflakes at the WIAA.Take, for example, the section that frowns on  booing of any kind. If errors in judgment is (sic) made, all are human and we must accept that. Individuals do the best to execute in a way they ve been trained,  the WIAA wrote.They also took issue with the  Na Na Na Na   Hey Hey Hey Goodbye  song. They called it  taunting and disrespectful. The WIAA found the  U-S-A  chant to be problematic, too   along with  any acronym of derogatory language or innuendo. Their guidelines became national news after a high school basketball player got in trouble for posting a profane message about the sportsmanship rules on her Twitter account.April Gehl, an honor s student and basketball standout at Hilbert High School, suggested the WIAA should (let me put this delicately) eat excrement.Based on national media coverage, her opinion was shared by many. Nevertheless, April was suspended for five games. Her family does not plan on appealing the decision.Paul Ackley is the athletic director at McFarland High School. He told WISC that he supports the recommendations. If a kid gets an answer wrong on the white board, they re not going to start chanting,  You can t do that,  he said.  This is not Division I athletics. This is an extension of the classroom and it s education-based. What in the name of Bear Bryant is going on Wisconsin?Granted, you don t want the children hollering out profanities and running around the gym buck-naked. But, these guidelines are not so much about sportsmanship as they are about political correctness.We re talking about high school basketball. It s not a croquet match.

U.S. Senate hearings delayed for three wealthy Trump nominees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate has postponed confirmation hearings for three nominees to serve in President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet, all wealthy people with wide-ranging potential conflicts of interest, including billionaire Wilbur Ross for Commerce secretary. The Senate Commerce Committee said on Tuesday it was moving Ross’s hearing to Jan. 18 from Jan. 12 because Ross has not completed all of the necessary government paperwork. Trump takes office on Jan. 20. “While Mr. Ross has submitted his responses to the committee’s questionnaire, we have not yet received the ethics agreement he is working on with the Office of Government Ethics and the Department of Commerce to finalize,” the panel’s Republican and Democratic leaders said in a joint statement. The Ross delay came shortly after postponements of hearings for Trump’s choices to head the Education and Labor departments. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee delayed a hearing for Betsy DeVos, the billionaire Republican donor tapped for Education secretary, to Jan. 17 from Jan. 11. The committee’s Republican majority said on Twitter on Monday that it had moved DeVos’s hearing at the request of Senate leadership to accommodate its schedule. DeVos is a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. The same panel had tentatively slated a confirmation hearing for fast-food executive Andy Puzder, Trump’s selection for Labor secretary, for Jan. 17. With DeVos’s hearing moved to that date, the committee said it had no specific date selected for Puzder’s hearing and may not hold it until February. Puzder has submitted his paperwork to the Office of Government Ethics, according to a Trump transition staffer. Puzder is chief executive of CKE Restaurants Inc [APOLOT.UL], which runs the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s fast-food chains. He has been a critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. ",politicsNews,"January 11, 2017 ",1,2048
NY Teacher Gives Assignment To High School Kids: Come Up With Argument In Favor Of Mass Killings Of Jews,"A pair of high school students who take classes at SUNY Oswego via a specialized program are upset at an assignment their  Principles of Literary Representation  class received: Defend Hitler s Final Solution.CiTi/BOCES New Vision program teacher Michael DeNobile handed out a  Top Secret memorandum  to the class  addressed to senior Nazi party members.  It asked students  to put themselves in the shoes of Adolf Hitler s top aides,  according to a report at Syracuse.com.Students Archer Shurtliff and Jordan April, who ended up on opposite sides of the, er,  debate  wondered: Does DeNobile really want students to argue in favor of  the Nazis  justification for genocide? Although the lesson does tell students it is  not for you to be sympathetic to the Nazi point of view,  and is just  an exercise on expanding your point of view,  Shurtliff and April allege it created a rather intolerant atmosphere.One student did a Nazi salute in class, they say, and another said he wished he d been assigned the pro-Holocaust side  because Heil Hitler, duh. From the story:The students brought their concerns over the assignment to DeNobile, administrators in the New Vision program and educators at their home schools.The classroom assignment took them on a mission: To make sure no other student would be asked to argue in favor of killing Jews again.They carefully documented each meeting and conversation with their teachers. They researched other cases, including one in which a teacher was disciplined.They came up with dozens of alternate assignments and materials that didn t force kids to argue on behalf of mass killings. They contacted the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates for Jews.Within a few days, an alternative assignment was offered. Jordan wrote about America s AIDS crisis and response. Archer wrote about the internment of Japanese-Americans and compensation paid to survivors.The students said they weren t satisfied with the administration s response.They are calling for an apology, for the program to retract the assignment completely, and agree to never give it again.Despite the alternative assignment offered, many chose to stick with the original.Archer and Jordan say DeNobile and administrators defended the assignment, claiming they were told  the essay was a lesson in having to do things you don t like, and in seeing the other side of an argument. But Shurtliff shoots down this rationalization rather easily:  It s settled opinion. You can t say that Jews deserve to die. It should be a settled thing. In a letter to New Vision officials, Anti-Defamation League Education Director Beth Martinez wroteThere is no assignment that could ever be given to students that even hints at their [sic] being  two sides  to the  Final Solution /Holocaust that would be pedagogically or morally sound, and we are very disturbed that students are reportedly being asked to be a part of this.Indeed, the assignment says the objective is for students to go  outside [their] comfort zone  and to train their brains  to logistically find the evidence necessary to prove a point. High schoolers   vouching for the annihilation of an entire people is   merely going  outside their comfort zone ? Lovely.For entire story: College Fix",politics,"Apr 3, 2017",0,3354
"WOW! Christian Author Gives UNEXPECTED And BRILLIANT Answer To Muslim Law Student Who Claims She’s Worried, “We Portray Islam And All Muslims As Bad” [VIDEO]","Brigitte Gabriel was born in the Marjeyoun District of Lebanon to a Maronite Christian couple, a first and only child after over twenty years of marriage. She recalls that during the Lebanese Civil War, Islamic militants launched an assault on a Lebanese military base near her family s house and destroyed her home. Gabriel, who was ten years old at the time, was injured by shrapnel in the attack. She says that she and her parents were forced to live underground in all that remained, an 8-by-10-foot (2.4 by 3.0 m) bomb shelter for seven years, with only a small kerosene heater, no sanitary systems, no electricity or running water, and little food. She says she had to crawl in a roadside ditch to a spring for water to evade Muslim snipers.According to Gabriel, at one point in the spring of 1978, a bomb explosion caused her and her parents to become trapped in the shelter for two days.They were eventually rescued by three Christian militia fighters.Brigitte Gabriel is now an American citizen, author, founder of ACT and a conservative lecturer. Gabriel attended a Benghazi Accountability Coalition forum that was supposed to be about Benghazi and how our government should be held responsible for their actions that led to the deaths of four Americans, but things took a dramatic turn when a Saba Ahmed, a Muslim law student in an America university stood up to defend the  majority of followers of Islam.  She told the panel,  We portray Islam and all Muslims as bad, but there are 1.8 billion followers of Islam. We have 8 million plus Muslim Americans in this country and I don t see them represented here.  Gabriel answered her question from a historical perspective and knocked it out of the park!

Hezbollah's Nasrallah says group to focus on Israel,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The leader of Lebanon s Hezbollah group, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, on Monday said the group and its allies in the region would renew their focus on the Palestinian cause after what he called their victories elsewhere in the region. Nasrallah called on Hezbollah s allies to put in place a united strategy  in the field  to confront Israel. The Iran-backed group has been fighting Islamic State in Syria alongside regional allies and the group has been largely defeated. Nasrallah was speaking by video link to a large protest in Beirut over the United States decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move its embassy there.  On Saturday a video was released of the commander of an Iraqi Shi ite militia allied to Hezbollah visiting Lebanon s border with Israel, apparently accompanied by a Hezbollah commander.  Nasrallah said in June that any future war waged by Israel against Lebanon or Syria could draw in fighters from countries including Iran and Iraq.       On Monday he repeated a call he made last week for a new Palestinian uprising against Israel and called on Arab states to abandon the peace process, describing negotiations with the United States as futile.   Today the axis of resistance, including Hezbollah, will return as its most important priority ... Jerusalem and Palestine and the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance in all its factions,  he said. Hezbollah was formed in the 1980s as a resistance movement against Israel s occupation of southern Lebanon and they remain bitter enemies. Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006 and tensions rose again this year as Israel struck Hezbollah arms stores and convoys in Syria. ",worldnews,"December 11, 2017 ",1,1756

Republican tax bill seeks elimination of some municipal debt,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. House Republican tax bill released on Thursday would put an end to tax-exempt debt issuance by state and local governments for an array of health care, education, and economic development financing, which took municipal market participants by surprise.  The proposed elimination of low-cost funding through private activity bonds, which many in the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal market were not expecting, would raise nearly $39 billion for the federal government over the next nine years, according to a summary of the legislation. “This came as quite a shock,” said Barbara Thompson, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, noting that there had been assurances from Congress that private activity bond issuance would be retained. Thompson said it would be devastating for the country’s production of affordable housing. “The bill will increase borrowing costs and harm the ability of state and local governments to build and to maintain the infrastructure,” needed for critical health, education, ports, airports, and low-income housing, Sandy MacLennan, president of the National Association of Bond Lawyers, said in a statement.    Non-profit hospitals, which are major issuers of tax-free bonds to fund capital projects, would also be hit.  “For many communities, tax-exempt financing, such as private activity bonds, has been a key to maintaining vital hospital services,” Tom Nickels, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said in a statement.  “If hospital access to tax-exempt financing is limited or eliminated, hospitals’ ability to make investments in new technologies and renovations in the future will be challenged.”  Also on the chopping block are advance refunding bonds, which issuers in the U.S. municipal bond market use to take advantage of lower interest rates before outstanding bonds can be called.  “Current-law advance refunding bonds provide state and local governments with incentives to issue two sets of federally subsidized debt to finance the same activity,” the House bill’s summary stated. Tax-credit bonds, which never really caught on with investors, would be repealed but federal tax credits for existing bonds would remain in place. Bonds issued for professional sports facilities would be subject to federal taxation under the bill. The Alternative Minimum Tax would end under the legislation. That tax is applied to earnings from a small percentage of muni bonds sold by issuers such as airports and housing authorities that have substantial private-activity components in their deals. The proposals are not a sure thing. The bill has a long legislative process ahead with changes expected before it could be voted into law. Bill Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said the likelihood of the final bill including the elimination of private activity bonds was “not high.” “It is hard to get support. There are an enormous number of revenue raisers in here and every one of them is politically going to be hard,” Gale said. ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2017 ",1,3131
LOL! Democrats To Sue Over “Unprecedented Environmental Catastrophe” Trump Wall Poses To Birds…Ignores Actual Bird Blenders Pushed By Democrats [VIDEO],"A conservation group and Democrat Congressman have filed a lawsuit to demanding an environmental study is performed before   construction of Trump s wall on the border between the US and Mexico. Biologist Jeff Corwin paid a visit to MSNBC to breathlessly warn viewers about the dangers of the wall President Trump plans to build on the Texas-Mexico border national security purposes. He warned viewers of the  unprecedented environmental catastrophic  consequences Trump s wall on wildlife. The MSNBC host responds to his highly dramatic warning by asking drama queen Jeff Crowin,  At the risk of sounding ignorant or foolish the birds specifically Wouldn t they be able to fly over that wall?'   HILARIOUS!Not surprisingly, there was no mention of wind turbines in Texas during the interview.Watch:Meanwhile in America, Democrats remain silent about the bird holocaust caused by wind turbines every year. An estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds are killed every year in N. America by these green energy bird blenders.Instead of worrying about Trump s wall  killing birds  how about addressing these wind turbines in oil-rich Texas that liberal federally-funded NPR promoted while using a picture of turbines on top of a huge wall of dirt? NPR  Another record was set for wind power generation this week, according to the group that manages much of the state s power. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas(ERCOT) says Wednesday evening, wind power generation on the grid reached10,296 megawatts (MW), or enough to power 5 million Texas homes during times of regular demand. That beat the previous record of actual generation by 600 megawatts, roughly the equivalent of a medium-sized fossil fuel power plant.Here s the real danger to birds in America that few Democrats are willing to address:In 2010 David Newstead, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service field biologist, visited the Gulf shoreline of Laguna Madre, Texas, to survey skimmers, terns, and egrets. But it was a flock of 15 American White Pelicans that caught his eye, flying toward the nearby Pe ascal wind farm. As he watched, a pelican at the flock s tail end was swiped by a massive turbine blade and  literally  erased  from the air, Newstead wrote afterwards. This in itself isn t surprising wind turbines are notorious bird killers but this specific farm was supposedly equipped with radar that could detect approaching birds and halt the blades. The radar had failed to do its job.Watch as what appears as this bird that appears to be an eagle, is killed as it s chopped by a blade on this powerful wind turbine:Wind turbines kill an estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds each year in North America, making it the most threatening form of green energy. And yet, it s also one of the most rapidly expanding energy industries: more than 49,000 individual wind turbines now exist across 39 states.  Audubon",politics,"Apr 17, 2017",0,3019

"Iran arrests Islamic State member, foils attacks: Revolutionary Guards","(Reuters) - The Iranian Revolutionary Guards arrested a member of Islamic State and foiled a plan for suicide attacks, a Guards commander said on Wednesday. Col. Amin Yamini, the Guards commander for the western Tehran suburb of Shahriar, did not say when the arrest was made but said the attacks were being planned for a 10-day Shi ite religious holiday that begins next week. The Islamic State member arrested was from the Syrian branch of the militant Sunni organization and had planned to organize about 300 people to carry out suicide attacks, Yamini said, according to Basij Press, the news site for the Tehran branch of the Guards. On June 7, Islamic State attacked the parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, south of the capital, killing 18 people and wounding more than 40. Iran has blamed Saudi Arabia for being behind the deadly attacks. Riyadh has denied any involvement. The Revolutionary Guards fired several missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response to that attack.

When the person showed up, he was arrested. Valuable information has been gleaned from his cell phone, Yamini said, according to Basij Press. ",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",1,1502
" California Rep Gets The Ball Rolling, Files First Article Of Impeachment Against Trump","California Democratic Representative Brad Sherman has decided that enough is enough and has taken matters into his own hands.Sherman believes Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey during the agency s investigation into Russia s ties to the US election and has filed the first formal article of impeachment against the President of the United States.The United States Constitution states that impeachment of a President is a possibility if guilty of  treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors  and obstruction of justice just happens to be a felony under federal law.Sherman said in a statement issued on Wednesday that he doesn t expect impeachment to happen right away, rather that he is trying to promote the idea of an intervention in the White House. For Trump to actually be impeached, articles must pass the House with a majority vote   something that will be borderline impossible in a Republican-controlled chamber.There is hope, however, as Texas Republican Representative Al Green has publicly expressed his support for the impeachment of President Trump, so hopefully, others might follow suit.Sherman s article lists other actions that President Trump has allegedly taken, besides the Comey firing, that could potentially be grounds for his impeachment. These include James Comey s allegation that Trump asked him to  let this go  in reference to an FBI investigation into Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, and his ties to Russia.Comey s firing is still the cornerstone of the article. With Sherman claiming that Trump did so in relation to the handling of the Russia investigation, the California Representative might have a valid point   namely the President telling NBC s Lester Holt,  When I decided to just do it, I said to myself   I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. I have introduced H.Res. 438 Articles of #Impeachment of Donald J. Trump for Obstruction of Justice. Statement here: https://t.co/0gKr8ZFg3c pic.twitter.com/yUTDAnPFuJ  Rep.

When he first started circulating drafts of the article in June, fellow Democratic Representative Michael Capuano reportedly stood up at a party meeting and branded Sherman as  selfish.

"ILLEGAL ALIENS DEMAND NEW BILL OF RIGHTS: To Include Citizenship, End Arrests And Free Health Care","Sounds great how about a new car?An immigrant-rights group proposed a  Bill of Rights  for illegal immigrants Thursday, demanding that Americans recognize there are millions already in the country who deserve health care, in-state tuition rates for college and a guarantee of citizenship in the long term.The list of demands runs 10 items long   the same as the U.S. Constitution s Bill of Rights   and also calls for an end to arrests and deportations for  all law-abiding undocumented Americans. The document was circulated by United We Stay, which is a group of illegal immigrants, first generation Americans and human rights activists pushing for changes to immigration law. We know we have human rights, even though our very presence is deemed illegal and our existence alien. Now we have our own Bill of Rights and we want it to be the framework for every immigration decision going forward from the local to the national level,  the group said in a statement announcing their demands.The 10 points include a demand that they be accorded respect; calls for citizenship rights and an immediate deferment of deportations; in-state tuition at public colleges;  wage equality ; medical care; and protection against deportation if illegal immigrants report a crime as a witness.The list also includes a specific demand for  compelled authorization of birth certificates for our U.S.-born children.  That appears to be pushback against the state of Texas, where officials have ruled that parents must present valid ID to get children s birth certificates   and have deemed the Mexican government s Matricula Consular ID card not to be acceptable as primary identification.A federal court has allowed that Texas policy to go into effect, ruling that there are questions about the reliability of the Mexican cards and that state officials have an interest in making sure only authorized relatives are able to get birth certificates.The list of rights begins with a protest against the terms  illegal  and  alien.  Immigrant-rights advocates say both terms are dehumanizing, and have offered  undocumented workers  or, in the case of United We Stand,  Undocumented Americans,  as their preferred term.The document is meant to serve as a goalpost for the ongoing immigration debate. Immigrant-rights groups had been gaining ground in recent years, with polls suggesting Americans were increasingly open to legalization.A legalization bill even passed the Senate in 2013   but Democrats, who controlled the chamber, never sent it to the GOP-run House for action.The issue then stalled last year after President Obama took unilateral action to grant a deportation amnesty to as many as 5 million of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Federal courts have put that amnesty on hold, but Mr. Obama s other policies stopping deportations for most illegal immigrants remain in place, which has effectively checked off one of the list of rights  demands.

" WATCH: Reince Priebus Lies Through His Teeth About Trump’s Star Tweet, And It’s Pitiful","Republicans clearly just have absolutely no shame anymore. It s already been discovered that the image tweeted out by Donald Trump featuring Hillary Clinton next to a Star of David on top of a pile of money was originally created by white supremacists, but that s not stopping Trump, nor RNC chair Reince Priebus from lying through their teeth.Appearing on CNN with Wolf Blitzer, Priebus is parroting Trump s effort of claiming that the star was just a random star pulled out of Microsoft Paint by their campaign staff when creating the image. That it s some sort of  sheriff s star  even though it doesn t have the globes on the points, and looks exactly like the Star of David.Priebus seems to completely ignore the fact that it s been revealed the original image came from white supremacists, and instead touts the line after claiming the star came from Microsoft: They figured it out, and they fixed it. Which they did, they turned the star into a circle, but it doesn t negate the fact that the original image is from racists, and both Priebus and Trump are lying to cover their own asses.Republicans need to learn to own their mistakes and apologize.

Head of Germany's FDP offers Macron 'bittersweet' euro zone deal,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A leading candidate to be Germany s next finance minister signalled his willingness on Thursday to seek a compromise with Emmanuel Macron over the French President s plans for deeper euro zone integration. Christian Lindner, who leads the Free Democrats (FDP) party negotiating to be part of Chancellor Angela Merkel s next coalition government, said European policy was one of the most important topics in the talks. Lindner said Macron   who last month called for a joint euro zone budget and joint finance minister among other reforms   had described political progress as a question of finding a balance between carrots and sticks.  Let s take him literally (on this) on the European question,  Lindner said at a book launch.   That means if he wants to get something, he ll have to accept other things - for example an insolvency mechanism for states or for example the binding participation of private investors in any debt restructuring if it should be necessary,  he said.  This would be the bitter thing he would have to swallow to get something sweet - namely additional funds for investments,  Lindner said. Veteran outgoing Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, wary of anything that might leave German taxpayers shouldering common euro zone debts, has been generally lukewarm about Macron s reform plans. Lindner may succeed him under the three-way coalition that Merkel is trying to form after her conservatives lost support in a federal election last month. It has been widely speculated that the FDP would demand the top finance post as a price for joining in, though Lindner on Thursday stopped short of claiming the ministry for his party. Earlier this week, he had insisted that Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) should relinquish it. Lindner has repeatedly criticised Schaeuble, a fiscal hawk, as being too soft on Greece and putting loyalty to Merkel ahead of his own political convictions. Asked which characteristics the next German finance minister should have, Lindner said:  Being consistent.  ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1,2103
French police arrest 10 far-right militants,"PARIS (Reuters) - French anti-terrorist police have arrested 10 far-right militants after an investigation showed they may have had vague plans of carrying out a violent attack on a place of worship or a person, a court official said on Tuesday.  TV station M6 said the men, aged between 17 and 25 were arrested in Seine-Saint-Denis, north of Paris, and in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille. They were suspected of planning attacks on mosques, it said. The court official, speaking to Reuters, said they may also have been targeting a person - a politician, a migrant or a drug dealer.  More than 230 people have been killed in attacks by Islamist militants in France over the past three years and the country has been under a state of emergency since late 2015, following an attack on Paris in November 2015.

" Michele Bachmann Goes Full Stupid, Questions If The Poor Should Be Allowed To Vote (SCREENSHOTS)","At some point, far in the future, former Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann will learn that she probably should stop expressing her opinion on any matter more complex than  which hole does the square peg fit in?  The Tea Party superstar s relevance has fizzled out over the years, with her base either dying off or ending up in prison for one gun-related crime or another   but this relic from the Hoveround Revolution still occasionally attempts to cling to her former stardom among the uneducated masses of the nation. Question: if 45% of Americans pay no federal income taxes, should they be allowed to vote?  she asked.Naturally, anyone whose intelligence is above the level required to operate a toaster without adult supervision mocked her relentlessly:     Why don t 45.3 percent of Americans pay federal income tax? They can t afford it, of course. Americans are underpaid and undervalued as the upper class continues to find every excuse possible to cut wages and profit off of the backs of those they exploit. This, of course, doesn t mean that they pay no taxes. Everyone, including the poor, pays sales tax and a number of others.Bachmann and her Tea Party cohorts view themselves as champions of the Constitution   a document none of them, including Bachmann, have apparently read. Not only does the Constitution guarantee the right to vote, but it is the right mentioned most in the text of the Constitution   as total of five times.  The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged   is very clear: U.S. citizens get to vote, period.I know, I know, it seems crazy that people like Bachmann are able to grasp the meaning of  shall not be infringed  as the half of the Second Amendment with which they are familiar is worded, yet are incapable of grasping  shall not be denied or abridged.

 Newt Gingrich Revealed The Incredibly Entitled Reason Trump Ran For President; You’ll Be Furious,"Newt Gingrich has been one of Donald Trump s most vocal cheerleaders, but in a new book, he threw his President under the bus by revealing the real reason Trump ran for President, and it s far worse than you think. Trump clearly thinks the presidency is a toy that he could buy because it s more fun than buying a yacht. His response was priceless,  Gingrich writes in  Understanding Trump,  in an excerpt published by ABC News on Sunday.  After a moment of thought, he said,  $70 [million] to 80 million: that would be a yacht. This would be a lot more fun than a yacht!   He also noted how Trump ran his campaign like a corporation    ahead of schedule and under budget. Describing a phone conversation he had with Trump after the South Carolina primary in February 2016, Gingrich said the presidential candidate said he was indeed under budget.  At the tail end of our conversation, he jokingly said,  By the way, I know you said I needed to spend $80 million, but I ve only spent $30 million. I feel kind of bad,    Gingrich quoted Trump, who won the South Carolina primary, as having said.Source: MarketWatchThat explains a lot. It explains why Trump is woefully unprepared to be president. It also explains why he seems to think the office is his ticket to getting even richer.Trump doesn t read.

He s offended all of our allies and he s helped accomplish the Russian goal of destabilizing the country. He also has the most corrupt presidency in history.While Trump might be having fun after spending less than he might have spent on a yacht, it s clear his presidency comes at the expense of the American people and of our reputation as the world s largest superpower. In other words, he s playing a very scary game and he simply doesn t care.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 19, 2017",0,2088
"Turkey's tourism earnings to reach $30 billion in 2018, minister says","LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey s crucial tourism sector should see revenues grow to $30 billion in 2018, helped by planned new incentives for tour operators and rising visitor numbers, the country s tourism minister, Numan Kurtulmus, said on Wednesday. Increased security fears following an attempted coup and a series of militant attacks slashed Turkey s tourism revenues in 2016 to $22.11 billion from $31.46 billion in 2015.  But numbers turned around in April, thanks to a surge in Russian tourists following an improvement in relations between Moscow and Ankara. Data for the third quarter of 2017 showed a rebound of nearly 40 percent year-on-year.  We are expecting 31.4 million visitors this year, and from that, revenue of $26 billion,  Kurtulmus told Reuters during a visit to London. In 2018, this would rise to 37 million to 38 million visitors, generating revenue of $30 billion, he said. Turkey s finance ministry in October predicted that tourism would generate $20 billion of revenue in 2017. Tourism has generated significant revenue for the $860 billion economy, which straddles Europe and Asia. In 2016, the government launched a plan to bolster the beleaguered sector. reut.rs/2jbKTa2 Kurtulmus said the cabinet was expected to sign off later this month on proposed new incentives to tour operators, offering them as much as $9,000 for every planeload of tourists they brought to the country, depending on the season. Turkey also hopes to become a greater health and sports tourism destination, he said, and to revive cruise travel, which suffered after concern over security led a number of operators to cancel trips in recent years.  We are working with other countries around the Mediterranean to come up with packages, to attract Westerners, especially visitors from the U.S.,  he said.  We are talking to Greece and others.  Turkey is also trying to attract visitors from Asia to broaden its appeal beyond its usual markets in Europe.  We are trying to open the doors of Far East countries - namely China, India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia,  Kurtulmus said.  They also have new real middle classes, especially China and India.  ",worldnews,"November 8, 2017 ",1,2227
DECLASSIFIED US INTEL REPORT Used To Discredit Trump Is Huge Embarrassment…Evidence Was Compiled In 2012 After OBAMA’S Reelection,"A highly-anticipated declassified US intelligence report, aimed to prove that Russia supported Donald Trump, has turned out to be a huge embarrassment. The annex that contained factual material that was thought to provide evidence of RT influencing the American public was compiled in December 2012, right after the reelection of Barack Obama.The report focuses on television shows and interviews that took place four years before Trump was elected, and well before he was even a politician. In Annex A of the report, intelligence agencies claim that  Kremlin s TV Seeks To Influence Politics, Fuel Discontent in US.  Buried at the bottom of that page is a note stating,  This annex was originally published on 11 December 2012 by the Open Source Center, now the Open Source Enterprise. The report notes that two RT shows, Breaking the Set and Truthseeker, focused on criticism of US. The problem is, both of these shows were off air before the 2016 election season began.The report goes on to detail programming in 2012 about voting booth irregularities, which, again, would have been during Obama s campaign. Despite being an old report, the topic became largely relevant once again during the Democratic primaries when voters found themselves purged from voting rolls, and hundreds of thousands of ballots went uncounted.Perhaps most shocking of all, the dastardly RT network dared to host third party debates, as they were not allowed participation in the main debates.  In an effort to highlight the alleged  lack of democracy  in the United States, RT broadcast, hosted, and advertised third party candidate debates and ran reporting supportive of the political agenda of these candidates. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a sham.  Apparently, the intelligence communities do not agree that some of the people they serve may not fit perfectly into the two neat and tidy political boxes of Republicans and Democrats. The report states that the network aired a documentary on Occupy Wall Street, an obviously left-wing movement, in 2012. Again, this was the year Obama was elected, so perhaps the Russians actually won HIM the presidency. They presented evidence that Russian media often reports on infringements of civil liberties, police brutality, and drone use. While these issues are all popular topics of discussion in left-leaning media, RT s reporting in 2012 was clearly part of a long-running plot to elect Trump, right?If the report is true and RT the Almighty was swinging votes in 2012, the only beneficiary of the coverage was the now-outgoing president of the United States, who won a landslide victory over Republican Mitt Romney. Four years ago Trump was not thought of as a politician and it remains a mystery how RT s 2012 coverage could propel him. A mystery, that even a classified version of the report would have a hard time explaining.    Sputnik news ",politics,"Jan 7, 2017",0,3103

UK's Johnson opposes adopting any new EU rules during Brexit transition,"LONDON (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson will oppose any move to adopt European Union regulations made after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported, risking reigniting divisions over Brexit. Johnson, who campaigned to leave the EU in last year s referendum, is one of Britain s highest-profile politicians and seen as a possible replacement for Prime Minister Theresa May. On Friday, he praised a speech by May in which she set out her plan for a roughly two-year transition period after Brexit.  But the Telegraph reported that Johnson had set out a new set of demands, reviving talk of a split among May s senior ministers which has the potential to destabilize her minority government.  Boris will be one of those Cabinet ministers pushing to make sure we don t have any new EU rules and regulations during the transition,  a cabinet source was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Johnson had fueled talk of a leadership challenge ahead of May s speech by publishing his own 4,000-word plan for Brexit which was seen as a criticism of May s more cautious approach.  May s transition plan, set out in the Italian city of Florence in a speech that sought to break an impasse in negotiations with the EU, underlined the importance of regulation to the future economic relationship with the bloc. She highlighted the fact that Britain and the EU start with identical regulatory standards and said she wanted  a practical approach to regulation that enables us to continue to work together in bringing shared prosperity to our peoples . She did not say whether she thought EU regulations passed during the transition period would be matched by Britain but said, on EU law, that British courts would be able to take European Courts of Justice rulings into account. May s Brexit minister David Davis said he did expect British and EU regulations to diverge over time after Brexit. ",worldnews,"September 24, 2017 ",1,2004
Justice Department appeals lawyer on Mueller Russia probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. Justice Department appeals lawyer is on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team probing interference in the 2016 presidential election, Reuters has learned. Scott Meisler, an appellate attorney with the Justice Department’s criminal division, is one of 16 lawyers who have signed on to the probe and one of only two who have not been previously identified.  Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, said Meisler joined the team in mid-June. In an investigation like Mueller’s, former U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said appeals lawyers would help determine whether the conduct being examined violates sometimes complex federal laws. “Having people who’ve spent their careers making difficult judgments in this area would be quite valuable,” Verrilli said. Appeals lawyers usually argue in federal circuit courts or the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold or overturn trial results. The solicitor general’s office represents the U.S. government  before the Supreme Court. Meisler is one of several appeals lawyers on Mueller’s legal team. The most senior is Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, who has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court and is widely considered the Justice Department’s top criminal law expert. Elizabeth Prelogar, an assistant solicitor general, is another appeals lawyer on the team. Mueller, who was appointed special counsel in May, is looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and  Russia during the election, among other matters.  Last week, his team began interviewing former and current White House officials, according to a person familiar with the matter. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. A 2005 Georgetown University Law Center graduate and fluent Spanish speaker, Meisler has been in his current position since 2009, aside from a recent year-long stint as an assistant solicitor general. He has represented the government in appeals involving search warrants and seizures, motions to suppress wiretap evidence, mail fraud, wire fraud, structuring financial transactions and money laundering.

" Trump ‘Cherished’ Letter Obama Left Him When He Took Over, Then Did The Opposite Of What It Said","It has become customary for a president, upon leaving the office to the next holder of the title, to leave a note of encouragement. Different presidents, of course, have done it differently. Back in 1992, George H. W. Bush left Bill Clinton a note that famously said  I am rooting hard for you. Good luck.  Clinton likewise left one for the elder Bush s son, as George W. did for Barack Obama.But when Obama quietly folded his letter and placed it in a drawer in the Resolute Desk, it contained more than just platitudes and well wishes. In addition to being twice as long   Obama is a speaker, after all   it was filled with not only an account of how powerful a position it is, but also advice on how to handle the job with grace and humilityAlthough Trump has never publicly read the letter aloud, he has often spoken of how much he cherishes it, when he s not busy tweeting about what a horrible president Barack Obama was. Now CNN has obtained a copy of the letter from a person that Trump once showed it to:Exclusive: In the letter Obama left for Trump on Inauguration Day, he lays out four points of advice. Read it here: https://t.co/NLczJTxyaz pic.twitter.com/ttqXGx6TxK  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 3, 2017Some highlights:It s up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that s willing to work hard.It s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.[W]e are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions   like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties   that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.As you can see, President Obama left Trump with a lot of advice he has definitely not followed. From Trump s sustained focus on repealing his predecessor s signature health care bill to his determination to cut social spending in order to fund more tax cuts for the wealthy, he hasn t built any ladders of success. In his constant tweets threatening North Korea and belittling China, Mexico, and even allies like Australia and Germany, Trump hasn t done much for  international order. But on the last few points, Trump has failed spectacularly. He has zero respect for the rule of law or separation of powers, and has proven himself an enemy of equal protection and civil liberties.President Obama s letter couldn t have surfaced at a more perfect time to highlight the differences between the man we got used to seeing handle disasters, terrorism, tragedies, and diplomacy humbly and the man-child who scoffs now at even the most common social norms.If only it had been a set of rules.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2017",0,3071
U.S. appeals court denies request to restore Trump's immigration ban,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeal court late on Saturday denied an emergency appeal from the U.S. Department of Justice to restore an immigration order from President Donald Trump barring citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees. “Appellants’ request for an immediate administrative stay pending full consideration of the emergency motion for a stay pending appeal is denied,” the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said. It said a reply from the Department in support of the emergency appeal was due on Monday. The Department filed the appeal a day after a federal judge in Seattle ordered Trump’s travel ban to be lifted. The president’s Jan. 27 order had barred admission of citizens from the seven nations for 90 days. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2017 ",1,842
TRUMP SAYS “YES” To Federal Funding For Planned Parenthood…Under One Condition…And You’re Gonna Love It!,"Sounds like a great deal, right? After all, Planned Parenthood insists that only 3% of its business involves abortions, and they get $500 million from the federal government. That way, they could focus that much more on all their work in pre-natal care! And yet  The White House, concerned about the possible political repercussions of the Republican effort to defund Planned Parenthood, has proposed preserving federal payments to the group if it discontinues providing abortions.The proposal, which was never made formally, has been rejected as an impossibility by officials at Planned Parenthood, which receives about $500 million annually in federal funding. That money helps pay for women s health services the organization provides, not for abortion services. Let s be clear: Federal funds already do not pay for abortions,  Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said on Monday.  Offering money to Planned Parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept. Providing critical health care services for millions of American women is nonnegotiable. This deal seems pretty straightforward, even if the White House never quite made it official. Planned Parenthood wants to keep receiving Title IX funds intended for low-income women who need actual health care that could be provided by other clinics, especially those which offer actual pre-natal health care. If that was the case, they could get rid of the supposed three percent of their business that deals with abortions and use those resources to expand other offerings, including services they already claim to do but don t actually provide at all. Their refusal to even consider the idea speaks volumes about their  values,  as do their abortion sales quotas.Their annual report shows overall revenue at $1.146 billion, which includes $553.7 million from government funds, and only $309.2 million from  non-government health services revenue    fees. If abortions only amount to 3% of their revenue, that would be $34.38 million for 332,000 abortions, or $103 per abortion (gross, not net after costs) if no other revenue was being used to cover it. These numbers don t add up with the 3% claim.Trump s deal makes this much clear, at least: Planned Parenthood values its abortion mill much more than it values $500 million in government funding each year. That really tells us all we need to know about their 3% claim, their values, and the use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize the operations of the world s leading abortion mill.   TownhallBy now, Femi-Nazi s are probably starting to get the idea that they re not dealing with your average spineless politician. Time to pull out the pussy hats and take to the streets ladies. As a conservative woman, I can assure you that the recent women s march (anti-Trump, pro-abortion publicity stunt) was an epic fail. Pro-life female supporters of President Trump are pretty much in agreement that it was the best imaginable way to convince more people to join our team. The vile and disgusting way these women conducted themselves in their fight to keep federal funding alive for the legalized murder of babies, was enough to make undecided women run as far away from them as possible   ",left-news,"Mar 7, 2017",0,3387
 University Official Once Said Rape Victims Were Actually Just Sick In The Head,"Baylor University s vice president for senior operations, Reagan Ramsower, apparently doesn t think much of women who report a rape. In fact, according to a former Title IX coordinator for the school, he made possibly the worst observation imaginable: Women who report rape are mentally ill.Baylor official called women who reported sexual assault  mentally ill,  ex-Title IX coordinator says | https://t.co/IZ4NiRs2QH pic.twitter.com/o8VORBE1D9  Dallas Morning News (@dallasnews) November 2, 2016While Ramsower denies this, but Patty Crawford appeared on and episode of  60 Minutes Sports On Showtime,  in which she said: It seemed like it came from the fact that one of the women   was suicidal. I said,  No   the incidents themselves have caused traumatic response in these women. They are not mentally ill. Someone who s been violated usually suffers from anxiety and depression related to the violation. The condition is not what makes women report being raped. Sadly, though, it s extremely common for our society to find ways to blame women for their trauma, rather than placing the blame squarely where it belongs   on the jackass who raped her.Crawford also said, in the interview, that she was refused access to police reports about rape on Baylor s campus, and was shut down in other ways too. Crawford told  60 Minutes Sports On Showtime  that Waco police  do not want the actual police reports turned over to Title IX . These are things the university and Ramsower vehemently deny, despite the problems Baylor is known to experience with rape, because of course they do.Why would they do that? Because reasons. All of those reasons have to do with rape culture in general. Women may not report rape for months, years, or even never, which discredits them in the eyes of the justice system and society in general. The fact that they often know their rapists just furthers the idea that they were somehow complicit.We have no universal legal definition of rape, so whether someone was actually raped often depends on how the justice system wants to define it for that particular case.But perhaps worst of all is that universities handle rape cases because of Title IX, and not because it s the right thing to do. The Department of Education can take years to investigate cases themselves, and many universities don t punish or expel the rapists, even when they re found guilty. And, in the case of Baylor, Stanford (Brock Turner) and others, athletes are treated as being above the law.Ramsower did acknowledge a failure on the part of the Waco police department to properly handle a case of gang rape. However, doesn t absolve him of claiming that rape victims are mentally ill by pointing to one victim that was suicidal due to her particular trauma.Featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet",News,"November 2, 2016",0,2895
China says damage to 'one China' principle would impact peace,"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China warned on Wednesday that any interference with or damage to the “one China” principle would have a serious impact on peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, as Taiwan said maintaining peace was in everyone’s interest. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States did not necessarily have to stick to its long-standing position that Taiwan is part of “one China”, further upsetting China which was already angered by Trump’s earlier telephone call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. The issue is highly sensitive for China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, and Beijing expressed “serious concern” about Trump’s remarks. An Fengshan, a spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular news conference the Taiwan issue was about China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. “Upholding the ‘one China’ principle is the political basis of developing China-U.S. relations, and is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he said. “If this basis is interfered with or damaged then the healthy, stable development of China-U.S. relations is out of the question, and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait will be seriously impacted,” An said. Taiwan’s policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said  peaceful relations were a mutual responsibility across both sides of the Taiwan Strait.    “Taiwan has repeatedly stressed that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the region is in the best interests of all parties,” said council spokesman Chiu Chui-cheng.  “Taiwan places equal weight on the development of Taiwan-U.S. relations and cross-strait relations.”   China is deeply suspicious of Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party, believing they want to push for the island’s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. China has repeatedly warned that hard-won peace and stability across the narrow strait that separates them could be affected by any moves toward independence. “I think the facts tell these people that Taiwan independence is a dead end,” An said. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and some state media have suggested after Trump’s remarks that a military solution may now be needed. A senior U.S. defense official said on Tuesday Taiwan’s defense spending had not kept pace with the threat posed by China and should be increased. Taiwan’s annual defense spending has not hit 3 percent of its gross domestic product in recent years, which some military and political experts in Taiwan have said should be a minimum level.  “Taiwan’s defense spending factors in external threats and the nation’s annual budget,” Taiwan defense ministry spokesman Chen Chung-chi told Reuters.  “Our premier has said previously that the cabinet can look to use a special budget to meet defense needs in an emergency situation.”In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the United States needed to handle the Taiwan issue cautiously to avoid ties with China receiving unnecessary interference. “As for the so-called issue of Taiwan being threatened, I think we’ve said many times that we oppose the United States and Taiwan having any form of official contacts or military relations,” Geng told a daily news briefing.

Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was sent gift-wrapped box of horse manure: reports,"(Reuters) - A gift-wrapped package addressed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s home in a posh Los Angeles neighborhood that was suspected of being a bomb was instead filled with horse manure, police told local media. The package was found Saturday evening in a next-door neighbor’s driveway in Bel Air, the Los Angeles Police Department told the Los Angeles Times and KNBC television, the NBC affiliate in Los Angeles. The package also included a Christmas card with negative comments about President Donald Trump and the new U.S. tax law signed by Trump last week. Reuters could not reach LAPD officials for comment on Sunday. An LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the package before opening it and found the horse manure inside, police told local media. Aerial footage from KNBC showed officers investigating a large box in wrapping paper, then dumping a large amount of what they later identified as the manure and opening the card that was included inside.  Mnuchin, who KNBC said was not home when the package was discovered, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive and Hollywood film financier. A road in Bel Air was closed for about two hours, KNBC reported. The U.S. Secret Service is also investigating the incident, according to the TV station. ",politicsNews,"December 24, 2017 ",1,1337
Argentine TV ad mocks Trump to promote soccer tournament,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An Argentine TV station is lampooning U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump’s comments about illegal immigration from Latin America to promote next month’s regional Copa America soccer tournament in the United States. “Our country is in serious trouble!” Trump says to ominous music in the commercial made by TyC Sports channel, which will broadcast the June 3-26 centenary tournament in the soccer-obsessed South American country. “We are having people coming in through the border that are not people that we want,” the candidate adds, against images of Lionel Messi and other top Argentine players descending from a plane and fans massed in national blue-and-white colors. The comments used in the advertisement are taken from Trump’s speeches. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the 71-second spot.  The billionaire real estate mogul has caused indignation south of the U.S. border with his views on immigration and promise to build a “great wall” along the Mexican border.   “They’re coming from South America,” Trump says in another clip from his speeches used by TyC, against a backdrop of Argentine stars from Sergio Aguero to Gonzalo Higuain pounding in goals against stumbling defenders. “These are total killers,” Trump says as the spot shows a close-up of Messi looking mean on the field. “These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think. We have no protection.”  Argentina, which has not won the Copa America since 1993, is among the teams favored to win the tournament, as are Brazil and Chile. “They’re unchecked, and then they’re being sent all over the United States,” Trump intones while the names of tournament host cities like Seattle and Houston flash on the screen.  At the end, the TyC ad shows a line of text, also in blue and white, that teasingly aligns itself with Trump: “It’s true. The best thing you can do is not let them in.” This is the first year the tournament, referred to in English as the 2016 Centennial Copa America, will be hosted outside of South America. It also marks the 100th anniversary of the world’s oldest international soccer competition. Former reality television star Trump won a commanding victory in Indiana’s Republican primary on Tuesday, forcing his main rival, Ted Cruz, to drop out of the race.

BREAKING: 28 YR OLD PALESTINIAN MUSLIM Feras Mohamed Freitekh Crashes Plane Near Pratt Whitney HQ’s…Instructor Pilot Said “It Was Intentional”…Media Says Motive Is Still Mystery…LOL!,"28 year old Abdullah Faris Freatekh, aka Feras Mohamed Freitekh was a Muslim with a Palestinian backgroundThe National Transportation Safety Board s initial investigation of a Tuesday s aircraft crash in East Hartford, Connecticut should be a serious concern as it was a possible attempt to destroy one major US military defense contractor. As it seems, Muslims are possibly attempting to carry out an attack by using airplanes again.The investigation by The National Transportation Safety Board also indicates the crash is the result of an intentional act, which means the likelihood this involves an act of terrorism. FBI and police have also raided the pilot s apartment and are questioning three of the associates of Feras M. Freitekh, the pilot. The Jordanian students were also studying to become pilots.Freitekh who was killed on impact is a 28-year-old Jordanian national from a Palestinian background who was studying to become a pilot died after crashing a small plane Tuesday afternoon in Connecticut, and the instructor pilot who survived the crash said it was intentional. Family and friends of Freitekh are already writing about him on Facebook with oodles of praises from  good man   hero  to  Allah be with him  in Arabic. Click and check it out for yourself. Rafeek Zabian comments  Our old friend, Feras Freitekh, is with Allah, after he fulfilled his dream to fly, he died as a pilot, yes, and he accomplished his dream, may Allah be with you .Here are pictures from the Facebook page of in what appears to be Mecca. The pictures appear to be very recent, as they are dated June 3, 2016. People see him kissing the tip of the propeller and they do not think. The kiss is a kiss for the tip of his missile he is using. He and the Muslims and relatives commenting know why he came to the U.S. The argument with the co-pilot that he  does not want to fly anymore  is an excuse to land early because his intention is likely to swerve at the US defense contractor facility. It would take hours to include all the other praises from folks who would seem normal to the naked eye, yet they harbor ill for the United States.What is alarming about this crash is that the crash occurred near Pratt & Whitney, a defense contractor that makes jet engines for the military. Pratt & Whitney is a major defense contractor which manufactures military and commercial jet engines. East Hartford Police Chief called the company s plant  critical infrastructure,  the Hartford Courant reports. Police said the FBI was contacted because of the proximity to Pratt & Whitney.A high-ranking law enforcement source told the Hartford Courant there was an argument between the student pilot and the instructor prior to the crash.  Terrorism is a criminal act,  East Hartford Police spokesman Lieutenant Joshua Litwin said at a press conference.  There is a lot of criminal investigators on scene. Nothing has been ruled out. The surviving flight instructor, identified by the Courant as Arian Prevalla, was able to get out of the plane after the crash and is expected to survive. Freitekh came to the United States from Jordan in 2012 on a temporary M-1 visa for flight school. The FBI and local police raided an apartment on Annawan Street as part of the investigation, WVIT-TV reports. Neighbors told WTIC-TV that four men lived together in the apartment targeted by police. Sources told the Hartford Courant the three other men who lived there were also foreign nationals studying to become pilots. And don t be fooled, the pilot, Feras M. Freitekh also has another Facebook as Rafael Majdi Freitekh and he is gay with all the rainbow flags. He was not a  peaceful Muslim  and neither was he a  peaceful gay  after all, as society tries to arm-twist us to believe about Muslims and gays. He stops writing anything on his timeline for a year is perhaps the man decided to go dark becoming a lone-wolf.The instructor pilot who survived the crash was hospitalized with serious burns, CBS News reports. He was identified as Adrian Prevalla by the Hartford Courant. Officials say he is cooperating with the investigation. He runs the Hartford Jet Center, according to his Linkedin profile. The flight school is based at Hartford-Brainard Airport, where the plane took off from on Tuesday.Via: Shoebat",politics,"Oct 12, 2016",0,4471

 Victims Of Terrorist Attack Question Lack Of Presidential Support,"Minnesota s governor did something the current occupant of the White House cannot do and quickly denounced  an act of terrorism  after a makeshift bomb tore through a mosque early Saturday morning.  What a terrible, dastardly, cowardly terrible act this was that was committed yesterday,  Gov Mark Dayton (D) said.  As someone said in the meeting, if the roles were reversed, it would be called a terrorist attack. And that s what it is, an act of terrorism. Authorities in Bloomington said that no one was injured in the blast at the city s Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center.If the attack had happened in a white evangelical church during morning prayers by a Muslim, Donald Trump would have used the incident to promote his agenda to ban anyone from that religion from entering the U.S.After lashing out at the media and a Democratic Senator over his military record, Trump has still not addressed the mosque attack which has unnerved the Muslim community.Residents of the state are still waiting for Trump to condemn the attack, but instead, the amateur president is busy rage-tweeting about his critics. Silence on the part of public officials at the national level only serves to empower Islamophobes,  Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement calling for Trump to condemn the attack, according to the Los Angeles Times. We are wondering why President Trump has not tweeted about this,  Asad Zaman, director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, told BuzzFeed News.  He seems to want to tweet about security and terror issues.

Ankara mayor quits in Erdogan purge of local government,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The mayor of Ankara said on Monday he will step down this week, the fifth mayor from the ruling party to quit in recent weeks in the face of demands for a purge of local politics by President Tayyip Erdogan. Melih Gokcek, a staunch Erdogan loyalist who has been mayor of Ankara for 23 years and won five consecutive elections, said on Twitter on Monday that he would leave office on Saturday, after meeting with Erdogan at the presidential palace. Four other mayors from the ruling party have already stepped down in recent weeks, including Istanbul s Mayor Kadir Topbas, following demands that they resign from Erdogan, who says he is seeking a renewal of his ruling AK Party.  Three mayors from our party have handed in their resignations so far, and there are three more. I believe they will hand theirs in as soon as possible,  Erdogan told a news conference in Ankara last week before Gokcek and one other mayor resigned. Erdogan decision to target the mayors follows his narrow victory in a referendum to grant himself sweeping powers last year, which was more popular with rural than urban voters. Seventeen of the country s 30 largest cities voted against it. Since then, Erdogan has spoken of the need for renewal in local government and the ruling AK Party, citing signs of  metal fatigue  within administrations. Gokcek, generally regarded as a staunch Erdogan loyalist, is well known in Turkey for tweets in which he has engaged in spats with journalists and with other senior members of the AKP. In February he suggested the U.S.-based cleric blamed by Erdogan for a failed coup last year might be plotting an earthquake, with the help of foreign powers. ",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",1,1742
Central African president pleads to U.N.: Don't forget us,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The president of the Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadera, on Tuesday pleaded with the world to not forget his country and urged the U.N. to bolster its peace-keeping force amid growing violence that threatens to spin the country out of control. Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans have fled a conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka (anti-machete) militias. Although unrest has since subsided, fighting has spiked this year and the United Nations warned this month that ethnic fighting could descend again into a much larger conflict if combatants are not disarmed.  Central Africa is at a critical moment in its history. We need the support of our friends; there are risks that we ll be forgotten,  Touadera told a news conference ahead of a high-level meeting at the U.N. General Assembly.  Violence has escalated since former colonial power France last year ended its peacekeeping mission in the country, which once had as many as 2,000 soldiers. France has grown concerned by events, although officials say Paris is unlikely to return to Central Africa unless the capital were under threat. The violence continues despite a peace deal signed between the government and rival factions in Rome last month and a 13,000-strong U.N. mission (MINUSCA), which will see its mandate renewed in November.  The only force capable of ensuring security is the United Nations,  Touadera said.  The capacities of MINUSCA in terms of men and equipment have to be strengthened.   National security forces are too weak to tackle a multitude of armed groups and counter the spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries. Diplomats have also said that Touadera does not have the political strength to impose central government rule. Touadera bemoaned the departure of France s Operation Sangaris, but also the withdrawal of about 2,000 American and Uganda forces that were fighting the Ugandan rebel group The Lord s Resistance Army and the withdrawal of MINUSCA s Congolese battalion in the west.  All of this has created a vacuum that the MINUSCA must fill,  he said.      ",worldnews,"September 20, 2017 ",1,2287
"Factbox: Trump controversies: Michael Flynn, the travel ban and others","(Reuters) - National security adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation under fire was just the latest in a series of controversies that have embroiled the Trump administration since it took office on Jan. 20.  Here are several of the tempests that have swirled around the new White House: Flynn quit on Monday after misleading the White House about his contacts with Russia before taking office and President Donald Trump lost trust in him, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. U.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called for an investigation. NATIONAL SECURITY AT MAR-A-LAGO Private guests at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida snapped photos of the president and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe conferring and looking at documents while surrounded by aides following a weekend missile launch by North Korea. One guest posted to his Facebook page a picture with a man described to be the holder of the “nuclear football,” or weapons codes. The incidents prompted concerns about national security, and a Republican representative asked the White House for details. Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 temporarily banning U.S. entry by travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees, citing the need to protect Americans. The ban triggered protests across the United States, confusion at U.S. and overseas airports and multiple legal challenges. A federal judge in Seattle on Feb. 3 suspended the ban in an order upheld by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. The Seattle judge’s order drew fire from Trump on Twitter, who criticized the jurist and the court system. The Republican president’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, said last week that the Twitter attacks were “demoralizing” and “disheartening,” according to a spokesman. Trump said Gorsuch’s comments had been misrepresented. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway urged Americans last week to buy his daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing and jewelry products during an appearance on a national television program after department store chain Nordstrom Inc said it was dropping them due to a decline in sales. Conway’s endorsement, which followed a Twitter attack by Trump on Nordstrom, prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans. On Tuesday, the Office of Government Ethics said the White House should investigate whether Conway violated ethics rules. Trump’s nominee to head the Labor Department, fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, admitted on Feb. 7 he employed an illegal immigrant as a house cleaner. Puzder, who already faced strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups because of his views on labor issues, said he and his wife had employed the housekeeper for a few years without knowing she was not legally permitted to work in the country. He said that when he learned of her status, he and his wife ended her employment and offered her help in getting legal status. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped plans to meet his counterpart in Washington during the second week of Trump’s presidency after Trump tweeted that Mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. Trump abruptly ended a phone call in late January with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, telling the leader of one of the United States’ closest allies that it was the “worst call by far” he had had with a foreign leader, according to the Washington Post. Trump said a deal between the United States and Australia on refugee resettlement was “dumb” and accused Turnbull’s country of trying to export the “next Boston bombers” under the agreement, the Post said.

In a letter sent to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a group of Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives called for “meaningful steps” against Myanmar’s military and others who have committed human rights abuses in an offensive that has driven more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the Southeast Asian nation. “Burma’s authorities appear to be in denial of what has happened,” stated the letter. “We urge you to do everything possible to ensure protection and security for those trapped inside Burma or willing to return, as well as oppose forcible returns from neighboring countries.” ",politicsNews,"October 18, 2017 ",1,953

"When #BlackLivesMatter, Golf Take Priority Over Our Vets: 76 YR OLD VET Kills Himself In VA Parking Lot After ER Allegedly Denied Appointment With Doctor For Mental Problems","There aren t too many stories that are more shameful or disturbing than this one. What has been done to fix the horrible quality of care our veterans have been receiving during Obama s eight years in office? What would the VA look like today if Obama spent as much time trying to fix this broken health care system for our veterans as he spent trying to improve his golf swing or organizing with Black Lives Matter terrorists? If anyone thinks Hillary would do a better job with our vets and their health care, they only need to do is look at Benghazi to see how much she cares about members of our US Military. Hillary continues to brag about her failed efforts to inflict a similar government run health care system on every American A veteran took his own life in the parking lot of a VA hospital in Long Island, New York, over the weekend after he was allegedly denied an appointment with an ER doctor for his mental problems.Peter Kaisen, 76, of Islip, was pronounced dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound outside Building 92 at the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Sunday.According to a note posted on a funeral home s website, Kaisen was married, had children and grandchildren.The Suffolk County Police Department has confirmed that Kaisen had been a patient at the VA hospital but said nothing about a possible motive behind the suicide.However, two hospital employees talking anonymously to the New York Times, which broke the story, revealed that Kaisen had been frustrated that he could not see a doctor in the emergency room, where he went to seek help related to his mental health.One of the sources told the paper that the 76-year-old veteran shot himself inside his car after being denied service in the ER. The source wondered why Kaisen had not been sent to the hospital s mental health center, or put in contact with a psychologist by phone. Someone dropped the ball,  the unnamed hospital staffer told The Times.  They should not have turned him away. The VA medical system, which serves nine million servicemen, has been under scrutiny since 2014, when it was revealed in a scathing report from the inspector general s office that about 1,700 veterans at a Phoenix hospital faced chronic wait times and were  at risk of being lost or forgotten .The VA later confirmed that at least 35 veterans died while awaiting treatment in Phoenix.VA officials in Phoenix were also accused of falsifying records to cover up the long wait times for medical appointments.Entire story: Daily Mail",left-news,"Aug 25, 2016",0,2689
"Gunfire heard in Eritrea's capital as protests break out, U.S. embassy says","NAIROBI (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Eritrea said it has received reports of gunfire in several parts of the capital, Asmara, after protests erupted in one of Africa s most secretive nations.  The embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid the downtown area where protests appear to be more prevalent,  it said in a statement late on Tuesday.  Avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and exercise caution when in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations.  It was not immediately clear what had caused the protests. Opposition outlets said the incidents were triggered after the government tried to close down an Islamic school in a predominantly Muslim district.  In some footage posted online, shots are heard being fired to disperse crowds. Via Twitter, Information Minister Yemane Ghebremeskel downplayed the protests, saying:  Small demonstration by one school in Asmara dispersed without any casualty.  Eritrea, which sits on the Red Sea coast next to one of the world s busiest shipping lanes, seceded from Ethiopia in 1991 after a three-decade war for independence.  Conflict broke out once again seven years later over a border spat with neighboring Ethiopia, and the UN has since accused the government in Asmara of committing crimes against humanity under the guise of national security.  A U.N. Commission of Inquiry report last year said that atrocities - including an indefinite military national service program that amounted to mass enslavement - had been committed since the country s independence and were ongoing. Eritrea denies the charges. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1,1669
WATCH: REMEMBER When President Clinton Took Credit for ENDING NUCLEAR THREATS from North Korea?,"Bill Clinton was falsely confident in his plan to end North Korea s nuclear threat with diplomacy. Over 20 years later, his efforts, along with those of every president succeeding him, have been futile.Every president since Clinton has allowed North Korea s nuclear ambitions to go unchecked. Perhaps now that North Korea allegedly has the capability of striking our mainland, America really needs is a president who is willing to stand up to North Korea s brutal dictator and let him know he s not playing with Barack Obama anymore.Will President Trump be the one to finally put an end to North Korea s threatening rhetoric by refusing to ignore Kim Jong Un s threats?North Korea now has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can range most of the continental U.S., and a new Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggests that North Korea has successfully miniaturized nuclear warheads for its missiles.In the early 1990s, Clinton faced a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, but he ultimately chose diplomacy and deals over the application of military force. I was determined to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal, even at the risk of war,  Clinton wrote in his memoirs. He decided to change course after receiving  a sobering estimate of the staggering losses both sides would suffer if war broke out. Watch Clinton brag about his great success with North Korea:NKorea Flashback: Bill Clinton on his deal with North Korea ""The world will be safer."" Whoops. pic.twitter.com/HDf86yqbEq  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) August 8, 2017Clinton chose the Agreed Framework, promising billions of dollars in aid for a North Korean nuclear freeze. This is a good deal for the United States,  he said at the time.  North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. The North Koreans negotiated in bad faith, however, offering false promises to convince the U.S. to unwittingly subsidize their nuclear program. The country began enriching nuclear material, and North Korea conducted its first nuclear test a little over a decade later. North Korea has since continued its steady march to becoming a fully-armed nuclear power. Evidence suggests that North Korea will achieve its nuclear weapons goals much sooner than analysts and experts previously expected.North Korea advanced its program throughout the Bush and Obama administrations, bringing the U.S. to the risky situation it now faces. North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,  Donald Trump declared to the White House press pool Tuesday.  They will be met with the fire and fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with the fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which this world has never seen before. While the casualty count in a North Korean crisis might have been high in the 1990s, the cost of a conflict now that North Korea has nuclear weapons would be in the millions.

 Voters Prefer America’s Most Hated Airline Over Donald Trump,"The current occupant of the White House has finally accomplished something for his first 100 days in office; he s considered by American voters to be worse than the country s most hated airline. United just can t stay out of the news. In late March, a United Airlines agent at Denver International Airport stopped two teenage girls from boarding a flight because they wore leggings. Earlier this month a passenger was violently dragged from his seat and down the aisle because the flight was overbooked. That man, a doctor, had to go to the hospital after the incident. Also, earlier this month, a man on a United flight back from Mexico was falsely accused of trafficking his white daughter.Trump is even more unfavorable than United Airlines.A whopping 42 percent of those surveyed by Public Policy Polling (PPP) say they prefer United more than Trump. In contrast, 40 percent favor Trump.We re sure the former reality show star won t be touting these numbers on his Twitter timeline:Pollsters found generally negative attitudes toward United, with 47 percent viewing it unfavorably. Twenty-three percent see the airline favorably.PPP discovered Trump fares worse than United, with 52 percent of respondents considering him unfavorably and 43 percent favorably.In the survey, United was ranked as America s worst airline. The aforementioned 69-year-old doctor s attorney said his client suffered a concussion, broken nose and lost two teeth during the incident.Trump s poll numbers are abysmally low, even in other surveys. The most recent one done by Pew Research shows the alleged president still garnering historically low approval numbers for any president during his first 90 days on the job.To put this in perspective, at this same point in Barack Obama s presidency, four times as many Republicans approved of him as Democrats who approve of Trump now.There is a difference between United and Trump. United feigns to be a caring airline in its ads, then drags customers off their flights without consequence. Trump is treating people exactly as he said he would. Nothing he does comes as a surprise to any of us. That is, unless you weren t paying attention during his campaign.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 20, 2017",0,2279
BEST SUMMARY Yet Of The Shocking Clinton Uranium One Scandal From The Beginning,"There s so much to know in order to understand just how bad the Uranium One scandal is to what s happening now with the Fake Russia probe by Comey. Once you understand the connections and the details of it, you realize it s HUGE!It s not just the Clinton grifters but Obama, the FBI and the DOJ!And at the heart of it is not just the greedy, grasping Clintons, but the Obama Administration, the FBI and the DOJ.Andrew McCarthy does a masterful job of breaking down the entire scandal from beginning until now.McCarthy breaks it all down for you.You ll be shocked to know that the same people investigating the phony Trump/Russia  collusion  were aware of the Uranium One scam AND even helped to cover it up! Here s just a little of what Andy McCarthy explains to us in his summary:Here s the kicker: The Uranium One scandal is not only, or even principally, a Clinton scandal. It is an Obama-administration scandal.The Clintons were just doing what the Clintons do: cashing in on their  public service.  The Obama administration, with Secretary Clinton at the forefront but hardly alone, was knowingly compromising American national-security interests. The administration green-lighted the transfer of control over one-fifth of American uranium-mining capacity to Russia, a hostile regime   and specifically to Russia s state-controlled nuclear-energy conglomerate, Rosatom. Worse, at the time the administration approved the transfer, it knew that Rosatom s American subsidiary was engaged in a lucrative racketeering enterprise that had already committed felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses.This next part is even worse:The Obama administration also knew that congressional Republicans were trying to stop the transfer. Consequently, the Justice Department concealed what it knew. DOJ allowed the racketeering enterprise to continue compromising the American uranium industry rather than commencing a prosecution that would have scotched the transfer. Prosecutors waited four years before quietly pleading the case out for a song, in violation of Justice Department charging guidelines. Meanwhile, the administration stonewalled Congress, reportedly threatening an informant who wanted to go public.Read more here: Andy McCarthyOnce you read the entire summary you ll know just how bad this entire scandal is and how the Obama administration covered it all up.

BOOM! Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) Rips Into Obama’s Gun Grabbing Legislative Minions: “Radical ISLAM Killed These People!” [VIDEO],"Don t think for a minute this union-style Black Lives Matter/Occupy type  sit-in  wasn t orchestrated in our Oval Office by our Community Organizer in Chief. Obama is desperate to pass gun control legislation before he leaves office. The Democrats who are occupying our House floor are only acting as puppets for his radical agenda. As California Democrat Rep. Brad Sherman spoke Wednesday evening during an unprecedented  sit-in  on Capitol Hill to demand a vote on gun control, Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX) interrupted him, shouting:  Radical Islam killed these people!  Sherman, a moderate Democrat from the San Fernando Valley, had joined several dozen of his party colleagues in a protest against House Republicans  refusal to allow votes on several gun regulations   all of which had already failed in the Senate.Though the bills have no chance of becoming law, Democrats hope to win at least one of the votes, which would enable them to argue that by voting Democrat this November, Americans could help them retake the Senate and pass new gun restrictions.The protest was led by Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who has long drawn on his history in the civil rights movement for partisan purposes, and who hinted last weekend during a Southern California visit that Democrats would  do something  big on guns.The protest was also timed to coincide with, and drown out, a speech in New York by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Trump responded to rival Hillary Clinton s attack earlier this week by criticizing Clinton for alleged corruption at the State Department and for her foreign policy record, while laying out his own alternative economic policies.Rep. Gohmert began heckling Rep. Sherman during his speech   which was broadcast via Periscope by another Californian, Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego, in violation of House rules. At roughly 4:24 in the video below, Gohmert points to a poster of the victims of the June 12 terrorist attack and insists that radical Islam killed them   not the lack of gun control regulations.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jun 23, 2016",0,2195
"LIBERAL Lansing, MI Mayor Forced To REMOVE “Sanctuary City” Status After MI Residents Hammer Him For Arrogant Announcement On Tucker Carlson [VIDEO]","Watch his appearance on Tucker Carlson where he announced that Lansing, MI would be designated a  sanctuary city  here:The city council in Lansing, Mich. voted Wednesday to rescind its decision to deem itself a  sanctuary  city for illegal immigrants after concerns from the businesses that the status would draw unwelcome attention to the city.The term  sanctuary city  generally refers to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with U.S. immigration officials. Under Lansing city policy, police don t ask for people s immigration status, except as required by U.S. or Michigan law or a court order.Council members voted 5-2 to reverse last week s 6-0 vote to give the city  sanctuary  status. Immigration advocates in the crowd called called council members  spineless  and said  you re all losing your seats. The dispute comes as several cities are battling President Donald Trump s promised crackdown on places that block cooperation between their police departments and U.S. immigration authorities. The Trump administration has warned that sanctuary cities could lose federal money for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities.After last week s vote, council members received a letter from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging them to remove references to  sanctuary city  from its resolution. Lansing is a diverse community, rich with history and culture. It s what makes our city a welcoming destination to live, work and thrive,  the business groups  letter says.  Recent actions of City Council, whether intended or not, have placed an unnecessary target on the City of Lansing while jeopardizing millions of dollars in federal funding that impacts the city budget. The term  sanctuary  in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting   so distracting in my opinion that s it s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,  said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke.  It s basically a  don t ask  policy, which was outlined by the mayor s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that. That was already the policy in Lansing before last week s vote, but Lansing called itself a  welcoming city,  rather than a  sanctuary city.  Neither the welcoming city resolution nor the sanctuary city resolution called for Lansing to prohibit workers from providing information on a person s immigration status with U.S. immigration officials   a ban that s at the heart of some urban sanctuary cities disagreements with the Trump administration.The issue also has touched off debate in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature, which is considering banning local governments from enacting or enforcing rules that limit communication and cooperation with federal officials concerning people s immigration status. Similar legislation died in the last session.   FOX News",left-news,"Apr 13, 2017",0,3019

"Polish cut in retirement age comes into force, bucking European trend","WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland lowers its retirement age on Sunday, a costly election promise by the ruling conservatives which goes against a European trend of gradually increasing the pension age as people live longer and stay more healthy. Lowering the age to 60 for women and 65 for men is popular in particular among supporters of the governing right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, and reverses an increase to 67 approved in 2012 by the former centrist government. It is seen as having a limited immediate impact on the economy, which is booming, but might put pressure on state budgets in the future. The move comes at a time when unemployment in Poland has fallen to its lowest level since the transition from communism in the early 1990s, and could increase the pressure on wages which are already growing at their fastest pace in five years.  The Polish labor market faces increasingly limited access to workers,  said Rafal Benecki, a Warsaw-based economist covering central Europe at the ING Bank.  Poland s population of 38 million is among the most rapidly aging in the European Union.    The government is throwing away the most effective tool to increase the labor market participation rate,  Benecki said. The state pension agency ZUS has estimated that 331,000 people could decide to take advantage of the option to retire earlier, which would amount to 2.0 percent of Poland s 16.3 million workers. Economists and central bankers say the rising flow into Poland of hundreds of thousands of workers from Ukraine could reduce the pressure on wages. Labour ministry figures show that Polish employers requested over 900,000 short-term permits for Ukrainian workers in the first half of 2017, compared to 1.26 million in the whole of the previous year.  With the inflow of workers from Ukraine, so far the problem that some have foreseen - labor shortages, pressure on the labor market - is diminishing,  central bank Governor Adam Glapinski said in early September. The PiS government has estimated the cost of the retirement age reduction at about 10 billion zlotys ($2.74 billion) in 2018, roughly 0.5 percent of GDP. Since coming to power in 2015, the current government has sharply increased public spending to meet campaign pledges to help families and distribute the fruits of economic growth more evenly. Despite the increase in spending, the state budget posted the first surplus for the January-August period in more than two decades, mainly due to a government crackdown on tax evasion and because a new child benefit has fueled consumption. Economic growth reached 3.9 percent in the second quarter, but economists warn that the higher cost of pensions could cause problems if the economy slows.  I m worrying what will happen when the economic cycle turns,  said Marcin Mrowiec, chief economist at Bank Pekao.  We might wake up with wages above levels that firms can cope with and ... permanently higher budget spending on pensions.    ($1 = 3.6471 zlotys) ",worldnews,"October 1, 2017 ",1,3051
EU MPs threaten Cambodia aid and trade over crackdown,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A European Parliament delegation warned on Tuesday that Cambodia could face EU action over aid and vital trade preferences if the human rights situation worsened further. The delegation s statement was the strongest threat of action from representatives of any Western donors since the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha in September and steps by Prime Minister Hun Sen s government to dissolve his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Delegation of the European Parliament called for the release of Kem Sokha and an end to the process of dissolving his party.          The government of Cambodia should be aware that the European Parliament is a co-legislator for budgetary and trade issues,  said the delegation s chairman, Werner Langen, a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats party.  A serious deterioration of the human rights situation might have implications for development assistance programs and trade preferences,  he said after a two-day visit. Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at Cambodia s Interior Ministry, said the European Parliament should keep trade and politics separate.  Some members of the European Parliament should distinguish between political agenda and trade for the interests of the people. We need to create many choices rather than make the interests of the people a hostage of a political agenda,  Huy Vannak told Reuters.  Without economic prosperity, democracy will just be an illusion,  he said. European Union countries accounted for around 40 percent of Cambodia s exports in 2016. Its exports, mostly of clothing, get fully duty free access under a scheme to help the world s poorest countries. Western diplomats say in private it would be difficult to secure EU agreement for limiting trade preferences because of the harm it could do to some 700,000 low-wage garment workers employed in Cambodian factories. The European Union and its member states also gave Cambodia nearly $170 million in development aid last year, according to Cambodian government figures. That was still well short of the $265 million it got from China, which is now by far the biggest donor and investor and voiced support for Hun Sen s government after the arrest of Kem Sokha. The government has intensified a crackdown against political opponents, independent media and human rights groups in recent months ahead of an election next July in which Hun Sen s rule of more than 32 years will be at stake. Cambodia s Supreme Court rejected an appeal to free Kem Sokha on Tuesday, saying his release could be a public risk as the threat of dissolution looms over his party. Lawyers for Kem Sokha had asked the Supreme Court to rule that his detention was illegal and said he should be granted parliamentary immunity from prosecution. The Supreme Court is due to rule on Nov. 16 whether to dissolve the CNRP after the government last month filed a lawsuit asking to dissolve it on grounds it was involved in a plot to topple the government. Kem Sokha was not brought to the court hearing on Tuesday.  The hearing seems fake,  Hem Socheat, a lawyer for Kem Sokha, told the court. Hun Sen has said his rival was getting help from the United States. The U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh has rejected any suggestion of interference in politics. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",1,3408

Philippine lawmakers defer decision on appointment of environment minister,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday said they would hold more hearings before deciding whether to confirm the appointment of the country s environment minister, although some said they were likely to approve the step. The confirmation of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Roy Cimatu is being closely watched given the policy implications for the mining sector in the world s top nickel ore supplier. Cimatu, a former soldier, replaced staunch environmentalist Regina Lopez who was rejected by the same legislative panel in May after less than a year in office. All ministerial appointments in the country go through a similar process. During her term, Lopez ordered the closure or suspension of 26 of the nation s 41 mines and banned open-pit mining, measures that Cimatu has not reversed. He has said his team was still reviewing the closure and suspension orders.  I am not pessimistic about his confirmation, but we need additional hearings,  Senator Tito Sotto, part of the 25-member Commission on Appointments, told reporters.     Apart from Sotto, two other senators, Juan Miguel Zubiri and Gregorio Honasan, also expressed support for Cimatu.  This is a proud moment for me,  Honasan, also a former soldier, said at the hearing.  I can vouch for his competence and integrity.  The next hearing is set for Sept. 27. Mining is a contentious issue in largely underexplored Philippines following past examples of environmental mismanagement. In 1996, a tailings leak at Canadian-owned Marcopper Mining Corp s copper mine in Marinduque contaminated rivers. The sector contributes less than 1 percent to the economy, with only 3 percent of the 9 million hectares identified by the state as having high mineral reserves being mined, according to government data.

" WATCH: Conservatives Don’t Punch Nazis, They Give Them Credentials To Attend CPAC","If there is one political ideology that every American should despise, it s Nazism. But conservatives don t seem to mind it one bit.On inauguration day last month, Nazi Richard Spencer got punched in the face by a protester during an interview.Spencer, along with others of his ilk, support Donald Trump and hail his presidency as a new era of white nationalism where fascism and racism flourish.It s no secret, of course. Conservatives have been moving further to the extreme right for decades and the end of that side of the political spectrum is Nazism.Rather than run away from Nazism and people like Spencer who advocate in favor of it, conservatives decided to give Spencer credentials to attend their annual CPAC conference.Spencer attended on Thursday, and he had a lot to say to reporters as supporters flocked to him like moths to a flame.When asked how he feels about being at CPAC, Spencer said he  feels welcome.

 The GOP Is Officially DOOMED As Cruz Drops Out And Trump Takes Command,"Ted Cruz has officially quit the 2016 Republican presidential race, according to a statement released by his campaign manager Jeff Roe. This brings an end to the last desperate hope that Republicans had to stop Donald Trump from leading their party directly into the 9th layer of Hell in the 2016 presidential election.Trump completely smashed Cruz, by approximately a 16 percent margin in the Indiana primary. John Kasich also technically still existed, coming in with less than 10 percent of the vote.Kasich has pledged to stay in the race until either he or Trump reach the required threshold of 1,237 delegates. Aside from most people saying  John who?  a reason this is a futile effort is that it s mathematically impossible for him to win enough delegates to beat Trump. To put it into context, Cruz needed fewer delegates and even he dropped out after Trump walked away with a gift-wrapped Indiana primary win.Cruz threw in everything including the kitchen sink to secure a win in Indiana. He colluded with John Kasich in a so-called  alliance  to try to swing a heavier vote count towards himself in order to take away from Trump s chances, he picked a VP candidate, even though she is universally reviled (what was he thinking?), and there was massive super PAC money doing ad-buys. He even netted the governor s endorsement.In the end, it was an embarrassing blowout that told him what everyone has been saying for months; The RNC is speeding towards the edge of a cliff, and Trump is in the drivers seat.Cruz issued some short remarks following his blistering defeat: We left it all on the field in Indiana.

White House official attacks court after legal setbacks on immigration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House official on Sunday attacked a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration as a “judicial usurpation of power” and said the administration was considering a range of options, including a new order. Sustained criticism of the judiciary from the White House comes amid concern among Democrats and legal scholars over Trump’s view of the constitutional principle of judicial independence as the administration seeks to overcome legal setbacks to its travel ban issued on Jan. 27. It has also become the backdrop against which U.S. senators consider Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court.  The Republican president said on Friday that he may issue a new executive order rather than go through lengthy court challenges to the original one, which temporarily barred entry to the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. “We have multiple options and we are considering all of them,” White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on ABC’s “This Week.”  Miller sharply criticized the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on Thursday that upheld a Seattle federal judge’s suspension of Trump’s executive order. He accused the San Francisco-based court of having a history of overreaching and of being overturned. “This is a judicial usurpation of power,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The president’s powers here are beyond question.” The Trump administration has defended the travel ban on grounds it will prevent potential terrorists from entering the country, although no acts of terrorism have been perpetrated on U.S. soil by citizens of the targeted countries. The ban’s announcement, late on a Friday, sparked a weekend of confusion at airports around the globe and within the federal agencies charged with enforcing it. It also triggered widespread protests and legal challenges. Aware that a new executive order would allow critics to declare victory against the travel ban, the White House has deflected blame and intensified its criticism of the judiciary. “I think it’s been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme branch of government,” Miller said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy,” he said. Miller’s performance on several Sunday news shows won a plaudit on Twitter from Trump, who has himself attacked individual judges and called the courts “so political.” “Great job!” Trump tweeted. Gorsuch condemned the attacks on the judiciary as “disheartening” in private meetings last week with a number of U.S. senators, who pressed the judge to go public. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, confirmed the conversations. Legal experts said the Trump administration statements could undermine respect for the constitutional division of powers. Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin said that accusing the judiciary of usurping the president’s powers demonstrated “an absurd lack of appreciation for the separation of powers.” “Miller is coming dangerously close to reviving a discredited and dangerous theory that each branch of government, including the president, has independent authority to decide what the law and Constitution mean,” Ohlin said in an interview on Sunday.  “In our system of government, the commander in chief executes the laws, but it is the judiciary which interprets both the laws and statutes passed by Congress and the Constitution. That’s their solemn duty,” he added. Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump’s remarks could diminish popular respect for institutions of law and order by making Americans think “the government’s a joke, that you don’t have to follow what judges say.” Immigration laws give the U.S. president broad powers to restrict who enters the country on national security grounds. But the same laws forbid discrimination based on race, sex, nationality or place of birth or residence. The case also could involve First Amendment protections involving religion. Trump’s executive order banned entry into the United States to refugees and citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. Options for the administration include formulating a new executive action, appealing the 9th Circuit panel’s decision to the full appeals court and appealing the emergency stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Miller said.

CLOAKED ORDER: Who’s Really Behind ‘New Authority’ for CIA Drone Strikes?,"21st Century Wire says Earlier this week, the mainstream media reported that the Trump administration granted the CIA a new  secret  authority broadening their ability to conduct drone strike operations against suspected terrorists. The new drone provision said to be without oversight from the Pentagon, was brought to our attention by  unnamed  sources published in the Wall Street Journal  But is this the full story?As big media rushed to condemn the Trump administration over the supposedly brand  new drone policy given to the CIA, the public has been left without a complete picture.While the new powers allowing the CIA to conduct larger-scale drone operations overseas should be of concern to the public   you have to wonder if it was truly issued by the Trump administration or already under place during the Obama administration.While it s no secret that Trump has openly discussed being tough on terror and might be involved with the CIA drone order in some capacity, we should also consider the fact that many Obama and Democratic Party loyalists would like nothing more than to paint the new president in a less than agreeable light, potentially looking to create a political tripwire to derail his first term.Over the past few years the Obama administration was said to be shifting more drone operations away from the CIA   but was that what really happened?In 2015, the NY Post published the following: President Obama secretly granted the Central Intelligence Agency more flexibility to conduct drone strikes targeting terror suspects in Pakistan than anywhere else in the world after approving more restrictive rules in 2013, according to a published report. The Wall Street Journal, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported that Obama approved a waiver exempting the CIA from proving that militants targeted in Pakistan posed an imminent threat to the U.S. In particular, the drone report outlined that while on the surface it appeared that Obama issued a directive to get rid of  signature strikes conducted by the CIA  many of the changes specified in the directive either haven t been implemented or have been works in progress. A signature strike can be conducted without presidential approval against any suspected militants.The NY Post then admitted that CIA had in fact a much broader latitude to target individuals under the Obama administration: The paper also reports that the CIA s Pakistan drone strike program was initially exempted from the  imminent threat  requirement until the end of U.S. and NATO combat operations in Afghanistan. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported the following drone statistics under Obama: Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.Strikes in the country peaked in 2010, with 128 CIA drone attacks and at least 89 civilians killed, at the same time US troop numbers surged in Afghanistan. Pakistan strikes have since fallen with just three conducted in the country last year. QUESTION: Is it possible that the CIA drone policy was just transferred from one administration to another?More from the Wall Street Journal below  (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton). By Gordon Lubold and Shane Harris Wall Street JournalPresident Donald Trump has given the Central Intelligence Agency secret new authority to conduct drone strikes against suspected terrorists, U.S. officials said, changing the Obama administration s policy of limiting the spy agency s paramilitary role and reopening a turf war between the agency and the Pentagon.The new authority, which hadn t been previously disclosed, represents a significant departure from a cooperative approach that had become standard practice by the end of former President Barack Obama s tenure: The CIA used drones and other intelligence resources to locate suspected terrorists and then the military conducted the actual strike. The U.S. drone strike that killed Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in May 2016 in Pakistan was the best example of that hybrid approach, U.S. officials said.The Wall Street Journal continues here READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"March 17, 2017",0,4566
" CNN FINALLY Does Its Job, Hammers Trump With His Illegal Donations (VIDEO)","CNN s Alisyn Camerota did something on Wednesday that s almost unheard of from CNN: She called out Donald Trump on his many, many scandals and in particular, the pay and play scandal involving Trump s bribing of Florida s Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi, who, after receiving a donation from Trump, dropped an investigation into Trump University.This isn t an allegation. Trump paid the donation, and he paid an IRS fine of $2,500 for breaking the law. Still, the media generally only talks about the Clinton Foundation or Clinton emails, both of which have amounted to absolutely nothing.Trump s entire narrative, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, is to paint her as  crooked Hillary,  a moniker that, despite sounding like it comes from a third grade bully who s been held back a few times, is sticking. That nickname is pure projection, though. It s Trump who s crooked and Camerota pointed it out: Congressman,  Camerota said,  don t you think the American public cares about breaking the law? Well, these are technicalities in many cases,  (Rep. Chris Collins R-NY) Collins said,  as he pointed out on the recent Bondi one. He was solicited for a donation, he told his clerk to do it. She wrote it out of the wrong checking account. Source: Raw StoryThen, back to  crooked Hillary,  Collins tried to make the claim that she did it too, which is completely untrue, since while some donors to the Clinton Foundation did ask for meetings, most were told to go through regular channels. With Trump and Bondi, however, it was clear quid pro quo. He gave her money and she dropped the case against him. For that, both parties should be in jail.Camerota pressed on: Let s look back,  she said, pointing out that in 1985, Trump was caught exceeding legal campaign donation limits by funneling funds through 18 subsidiary companies, which is technically legal, but is essentially a corporate version of the crime that sent right-wing provocateur Dinesh D Souza to federal prison.Cameron went on to describe actual illegalities that Trump has been fined for. Isn t this the very definition of payola?  Camerota asked.  Payola is the practice of bribing someone to use their influence to promote your particular interest. How does this differ? Collins kept on with his both sides do it argument until Camerota astutely mentioned the one key difference: what Trump did was illegal. What Clinton did wasn t.

Trump campaign aide met Russian officials in 2016: NY Times,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign met Russian government officials last year, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing testimony he gave this week to a U.S. congressional committee. In numerous media interviews in recent months, the adviser, Carter Page, has either denied meeting Russian government officials during a July 2016 trip to Moscow or said he met  “mostly scholars,” the newspaper said. Page sent an email to at least one Trump campaign aide describing his insights after conversations with Russian government officials and others, the Times reported, citing a person familiar with the message. The newspaper said the email was read aloud during the closed-door testimony on Thursday to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which is investigating efforts by Russia to tip the November 2016 election in Trump’s favor and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Russia says it did not interfere in the election and Trump has denied any collusion. Page played down the significance of the meetings in an interview with the Times on Friday. “I had a very brief hello to a couple of people. That was it,” he said. Page said one of the people he met was a “senior person,” but would not confirm the person’s identity. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who has impaneled a grand jury in his probe of the collusion allegations, charged Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering on Monday. It was announced the same day that another Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty early in October to lying to the FBI. Page was questioned by the FBI earlier this year and has also appeared before the grand jury as part of the special counsel’s probe, the Times said. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2017 ",1,1884
 BREAKING: Active Shooter Reported Outside Los Angeles Polling Location – 1 Dead,"An active shooter situation is developing in Los Angeles outside a polling place in Azusa. Not much is known at the moment, including whether the shooting is political in nature or not. However, the fact that it happened outside a polling location automatically makes it suspicious.According to the Los Angeles Times, the shooting happened sometime after 2 p.m. Pacific time, so just before polls closed on the East Coast. Police are not reporting the exact location of the shooting in order to protect the safety of the officers, victims, and bystanders in the area.One victim was rushed to the hospital where they died. Three others were wounded. One voter told CNN: At first, I thought it was construction but people came running into the room saying they see a guy with a bulletproof vest and a white shirt. As of right now, they just have us in the voting room and are trying to keep us calm. The polling station and two schools were on lockdown at the time of this posting. The L.A. County registrar was urging voters to steer clear of the area. Police have said the shooting is contained now:#UPDATE: Police say shooter in Azusa has been contained,but shelter in place order remains for those nearbyhttps://t.co/C7J0v5eLFd  Good Day LA (@GDLA) November 9, 2016Given that this is the most contentious election in modern history, and it s been fueled by some of the worst right-wing hate there is, it s not hard to wonder whether the shooting was related to Donald Trump s calls for supporters to  ensure  that everything at polls around the country is the up-and-up. It s also possible that someone wanted to scare people away from the polls.NOTE: We are not saying that this is the case because we don t know what happened right now. It s entirely possible that this is completely unrelated to the election   authorities aren t releasing much information.Police are saying that the shooter has been contained, but voters are still going to alternate polling places.Featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet",News,"November 8, 2016",0,2105
" Rich A**hole Ran For President Thinking It Would Be An ‘Easy’ Job, Gets HUMILIATED By Reality","Donald Trump seriously thought having the hardest job on Earth would be  easy.  LOL!After 100 days on the job, many of which Trump spent at his lavish Florida resort playing golf, Trump stated during an interview with Reuters that he thought the presidency would be an easy job that he could just sail through.Trump complained about how his current job requires him to do much more work than he is accustomed to doing and waxed nostalgic about his life before taking over the White House. I loved my previous life. I had so many things going,  Trump said.  This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier. This demonstrates just how woefully unprepared Trump was to become president. And it certainly shows.After all, Trump s administration has been a complete failure only three months in.His unconstitutional executive actions on immigration have been blocked by federal judges. His effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act went down in flames, much to the relief of millions of Americans. His environmental record is a disaster. He still denies science and is cutting funding to scientific agencies and organizations. He has alienated our allies while continuing to praise Russia and Putin. He is embroiled in an ever-growing scandal. And he has turned America into a laughingstock around the world.And that s just the tip of the iceberg as Trump threatens World War III over North Korea and a government shutdown looms because he refuses to negotiate with Democrats.The only president who has had an arguably worse first 100 days is William Henry Harrison and that s only because he died 30 days into his presidency. But at least he didn t embarrass the nation and destroy it from within.The fact is that being president is a tough job. It s also a lonely job. There s a reason why presidents go grey during their years in office. It s a stressful job. Every decision made affects the nation and the world. Maybe if Trump spent less time golfing, tweeting, and watching cable news he would know that being president means working with Congress, including Democrats. Instead, Trump would rather act like a dictator and just sign executive orders between tee times and whine when he doesn t get his way.Clearly, Trump doesn t know what hard work is.Featured Image: Tom Pennington/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2017",0,2413
 France’s President Threw AWESOME Shade At Trump After He Pulled Us From Paris Agreement,"French President Emmanuel Macron wasted no time in condemning Trump for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. He signed a joint press release that included Italy and Germany saying the agreement will not be renegotiated, he blasted us later on his own during a press conference, and now he s throwing shade at Trump on Twitter.But Macron isn t just attacking Trump over the Paris agreement. He s also trolling Trump and his followers over their  Make America Great Again!  chant. What did he do? Check it out:pic.twitter.com/3g5LYO9Osj  Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) June 1, 2017In a way, Macron began trolling Trump when he was in Europe last week. During a meeting, where he and Trump shook hands, it became a white-knuckled affair from which Trump tried twice to escape. Later on, Macron flatly admitted that his side of the handshake wasn t innocent. It was to send Trump a subtle message that the world will not let him bully them into submission on anything.One White House staffer, however, has something else to say about Trump s pissing off our Western allies, and it s not good. In fact, it s patently disgusting:Pressure from leaders abroad also backfired. One senior White House official characterized disappointing European allies as  a secondary benefit  of Trump s decision to withdraw.Trump can t even correctly interpret a study from MIT that says, if all the signatories of the Paris agreement kept their pledges, global warming would slow by between. 0.6 degrees and 1.1 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. Trump, however, cited the study and claimed that it would only produce a 0.2 degree reduction in global temperature.MIT doesn t support Trump in his decision, either. Basically, nobody except people who are in love with and brainwashed by Donald Trump support his decision.Featured image by Aurelien Meunier via Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2017",0,1964
Puerto Rico debt bill cleared for Thursday U.S. House vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation helping Puerto Rico dig out of its $70 billion debt crisis is set for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a House panel fended off attempts to open the bill to a series of controversial amendments. By voice vote on Wednesday, the Rules Committee, the gatekeeper for bills moving through the House, sent the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to the full House for debate and a likely vote on Thursday. The legislation, the result of months of negotiations between Congress and the Obama administration, would create a federal oversight board to work with investors to determine how much they would recover of the island territory’s $70 billion in loans. Republicans have stressed that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out Puerto Rico from a crisis that has left nearly half of the population in poverty amid closings of schools and hospitals and a contracting economy. During a Rules panel debate that stretched into the night, the committee rejected pleas to allow amendments that would have changed the basic structure of the legislation and the operation of the oversight board. If the bill passes the House, action would move to the Senate, where some leading Democrats have said they would seek significant changes. Earlier on Wednesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, who ushered the bill through his committee on May 25, told reporters he expected the full House to pass it on Thursday. Bishop, a Utah Republican, said a strong vote for passage in the House would help propel it through the Senate. “The bottom line is the better the vote here (in the House), the less likely it’s going to come back in a significantly altered form” from the Senate, Bishop said. Supporters hope to get it enacted into law before July 1, when Puerto Rico faces a deadline for making a $1.9 billion debt payment that it might not be able to fulfill. The House Rules Committee voted to allow debate on a limited number of amendments, including one giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in Puerto Rico, such as mass transportation assets. Another amendment expected to be debated would expand a federal program aimed at encouraging economic development in Puerto Rico’s “under-utilized” business zones. Representative Raul Grijalva, a senior Democrat who worked on the bill, said Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, if unaddressed, could grow into a humanitarian crisis. Stabilization measures contained in the bill, he said, “would be the first step toward getting the situation under control.” But his fellow Democrat, Puerto Rican-born Representative Luis Gutierrez, warned, “I don’t think many of my colleagues in this body appreciate just how deeply offensive the bill before us is regarded in Puerto Rico.” He was particularly concerned with the way control board members would be chosen, with most not having to have any ties to the island. But Gutierrez failed to convince the committee to allow amendments to be offered making changes to the board and its operations. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1,3162

Then Noah walks to the door and closes it as the man walks away.Donald Trump has made anti-Muslim bigotry one of the centerpieces of his presidential campaign. He issued a call for Muslims to be barred from travel to the United States, and repeated the message in a press release and a live media event.The attacks on Muslims have been repudiated by civil rights organizations and leading politicians like President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders. Even some Republicans have said Trump s attack on Muslims is beyond the pale and not reflective of American values.The Trump campaign, after winning the nomination, has attempted to step away from some of those comments. But his most ardent supporters, and a majority of Republicans according to multiple polls, share the same view of Muslims as the bigot in the ice cream parlor.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 26, 2016",0,2200
BREAKING: OBAMA JUST TURNED INTERNET Over To International Body With NO Congressional Approval…4 AG’S From These States Are FIGHTING BACK!,"Has Obama sacrificed the freedom of speech we enjoy on the internet, as a way to boost his standing with foreign dictators, as he campaigns to be the next UN Secretary General?  An Obama-appointed federal judge ruled Friday that the transfer of internet domain systems oversight to an international governing body can move forward, overruling opposition from several state attorneys general and lawmakers. Read more: Zero HedgeIn their lawsuit, the attorneys general for Arizona, Oklahoma, Nevada and Texas contend that the transition, lacking congressional approval, amounts to an illegal giveaway of U.S. government property. They also express fear that the proposed new steward of the system, a nonprofit known as ICANN, would be so unchecked that it could  effectively enable or prohibit speech on the Internet. Read more: PoliticoSATURDAY   THE US HANDS OVER THE INTERNETWashington (AFP)   The US government on Saturday ended its formal oversight role over the internet, handing over management of the online address system to a global non-profit entity.The US Commerce Department announced that its contract had expired with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which manages the internet s so-called  root zone. That leaves ICANN as a self-regulating organization that will be operated by the internet s  stakeholders    engineers, academics, businesses, non-government and government groups.The move is part of a decades-old plan by the US to  privatize  the internet, and backers have said it would help maintain its integrity around the world.US and ICANN officials have said the contract had given Washington a symbolic role as overseer or the internet s  root zone  where new online domains and addresses are created.But critics, including some US lawmakers, argued that this was a  giveaway  by Washington that could allow authoritarian regimes to seize control.A last-ditch effort by critics to block the plan   a lawsuit filed by four US states   failed when a Texas federal judge refused to issue an injunction to stop the transition.Lawrence Strickling, who heads the Commerce Department unit which has managed these functions, issued a brief statement early Saturday confirming the transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). As of October 1, 2016, the IANA functions contract has expired,  he said.Stephen Crocker, ICANN s board chairman and one of the engineers who developed the early internet protocols, welcomed the end of the contract. This transition was envisioned 18 years ago, yet it was the tireless work of the global Internet community, which drafted the final proposal, that made this a reality,  he said in a statement. This community validated the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance. It has shown that a governance model defined by the inclusion of all voices, including business, academics, technical experts, civil society, governments and many others is the best way to assure that the Internet of tomorrow remains as free, open and accessible as the Internet of today. The Internet Society, a group formed by internet founders aimed at keeping the system open, said the transition was a positive step. The IANA transition is a powerful illustration of the multi-stakeholder model and an affirmation of the principle that the best approach to address challenges is through bottom-up, transparent, and consensus-driven processes,  the group said in a statement.Via: Yahoo ",Government News,"Oct 1, 2016",0,3596

FALSE PROFITS: The U.S. Military’s War Over Russia,"21st Century Wire says We ve said it many times during the last two years here at 21WIRE and on the SUNDAY WIRE radio show   that the present anti-Russia hysteria being rolled out in the US and Britain is simply a cheap facade to gin up a new arms race.  Not small ticket items, but big ticket items   including the next generation of  next generation tactical nuclear weapons. The only problem is: the out-of-control rhetoric, mixed with Washington s careless and belligerent military posturing  might inadvertently lead to belligerent military action.Watch US Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley last week, threatening to  destroy any enemy, anytime,  meaning Russia.. General Milley performed his duty for the corporations. All smiles at the AGM. Indeed, business has never been better. Bravo, encore!  says Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Airbus and General Electric.When will it end? How much profit is enough for the US  defense  industry?The sad truth: it s never enough  Mark Perry PoliticoDuring the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, a unit of Robert E. Lee s army rolled up some artillery pieces and began shelling the headquarters of Union commander Ulysses S. Grant. When one of his officers pleaded that Grant move, insisting that he knew exactly what Lee was going to do, Grant, normally a taciturn man, lost his temper:  Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do,  he said.  Some of you always seem to think he is going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do. The story was recalled to me a few weeks ago by a senior Pentagon officer in citing the April 5 testimony of Army leaders before a Senate Armed Services Subcommittee. The panel delivered a grim warning about the future of the U.S. armed forces: Unless the Army budget was increased, allowing both for more men and more materiel, members of the panel said, the United States was in danger of being  outranged and outgunned  in the next war and, in particular, in a confrontation with Russia. Vladimir Putin s military, the panel averred, had outstripped the U.S. in modern weapons capabilities. And the Army s shrinking size meant that  the Army of the future will be too small to secure the nation.  It was a sobering assessment delivered by four of the most respected officers in the Army including Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, his service s leading intellectual. The claim is the prevailing view among senior Army officers, who fear that Army readiness and modernization programs are being weakened by successive cuts to the U.S. defense budget.But not everyone was buying it. This is the  Chicken-Little, sky-is-falling  set in the Army,  the senior Pentagon officer said. These guys want us to believe the Russians are 10 feet tall. There s a simpler explanation: The Army is looking for a purpose, and a bigger chunk of the budget. And the best way to get that is to paint the Russians as being able to land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. What a crock. ( ) The fight over the Army panel s testimony is the latest example of a deepening feud in the military community over how to respond to shrinking budget numbers. At issue is the military s strategic future: Facing cuts, will the Army opt to modernize its weapons  arsenal, or defer modernization in favor of increased numbers of soldiers? On April 5, the Army s top brass made its choice clear: It wants to do both, and Russia s the reason. But a growing chorus of military voices says that demand is both backward and dangerously close-minded that those same senior military officers have not only failed to understand the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq and embrace service reform, they are inflating foreign threats to win a bigger slice of the defense budget Continue this story at Politico.comREAD MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia Files",US_News,"October 18, 2016",0,4100

 Trump Attacks James Comey For Not Jailing Clinton: ‘She Was Guilty Of Every Charge’ (VIDEO),"In an interview with Fox Business that aired Tuesday, Donald Trump responded to news that the FBI had successfully obtained a FISA warrant to look into his former advisor Carter Page by trashing James Comey for not locking Hillary Clinton up. Sure, Clinton did not commit any crimes and was never charged with anything, but according to Trump she is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY. When Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. He saved her life, Trump said, apparently forgetting that a certain letter from Comey helped swing the election his way. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty of every charge, and then he said she was essentially OK. Nevertheless, for some reason Trump says he trusts Comey to clear him with regard to Russia.Trump also complained that he is understaffed because of  obstructionist  Democrats and other things that prevent him from accomplishing what he wants   like  the law.  In reality, the problem is that The Donald isn t actually nominating people. Democrats have only  obstructed  when there was a legitimate objection, like that the person worked with Russia or is a white supremacist.Trump told Fox that he still believes he was correct when he accused President Obama of  tapping  his  wires  at Trump Tower because numerous members of his administration were and are under investigation by the FBI for their illegal activities (many involving Russia). While it is true that Trump Tower was monitored years ago, it had more to do with the Russian money laundering operation that was happening three floors below Trump s penthouse than anything else. Over 30 Russian mobsters were indicted as a result of the investigation.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017",0,1814
 OOPS: Trump Judicial Nominee Didn’t Tell Congress About Marriage To White House Attorney,"This is a major conflict of interest that should automatically disqualify him.When the Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to approve Donald Trump s nomination of Brett Talley to a federal judgeship in Alabama, they did so without knowing that Talley is married to White House lawyer Ann Donaldson, who is the chief of staff to White House counsel Donald McGahn.That s a pretty big detail to leave out of a disclosure form.According to the New York Times,Mr. Talley was asked on his publicly released Senate questionnaire to identify family members and others who are  likely to present potential conflicts of interest.  He did not mention his wife.District judges often provide the first ruling when laws are called into question, decisions that can put them at odds with the White House and its lawyers. Last month, for example, judges in Hawaii and Maryland temporarily blocked Mr. Trump s travel ban.Mr. Talley also did not mention his wife when he described his frequent contact with White House lawyers during the nomination process.Talley has also never tried a case in his life, making him even more unqualified to be a judge. In fact, the American Bar Association judged Tally as  unqualified  for the position in a very rare unanimous decision.The Senate could hold a confirmation vote as early as Monday, and it is important that they reject Talley, especially since he lied to them by omission.If Republicans confirm Talley, they will be telling future nominees that it s okay to lie to Congress in order to get an important job. That should not be allowed to happen. Trump and Republicans often claim that immigration should be based on merit. Well, becoming a federal judge should definitely be based on merit, not based on who you re married to and whether you ll be a rubber stamp for a corrupt administration.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images ",News,"November 13, 2017",0,1971
"CNN in a Panic Over Assad Success, Collapse of ‘White Helmets’ Narrative, Fumbling Over ‘Humanitarian Organizations’","By Brandon TurbevilleCNN is in full panic mode with the recent resumption of the Syrian government assault on terrorist-held East Aleppo. The discredited  news  agency is now reduced to rehashing tired and disproven propaganda against the Syrian government and claims that  Assad is killing his own people  by bombing head-chopping terrorists in East Aleppo.You have to hand it to CNN for consistency at least. Cutting edge propaganda, however, is not the corporation s strong suit, since every time it has tried to deliver a major blow, it has resulted in an epic fail  RECYCLED IMAGE: Yesterday, CNN used this recycled, staged image to sell its story, allegedly from a hospital in Aleppo used across US media last month.[Watch CNN reporter Will Ripley s propaganda video here, complete with staged imagery from the US, NATO Member-funded White Helmets and Aleppo Media Centre regime change NGOs]This time, the propaganda of choice is the same tired line that every bomb (excuse me, every  barrel bomb ) being dropped on East Aleppo has been dropped intentionally on top of civilians for the purpose of killing them all because . . . . well, that part has never been explained. But, for the average CNN reader, just know that Assad is a  bad guy  and that the  rebels  who demand veiled, silent, women and full adherence to Sharia law under pain of death are  good guys  and democracy-loving freedom fighters. The regime s siege of rebel-held neighborhoods has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe as food, water and medical supplies run low,  says CNN.Obviously, the humanitarian conditions in East Aleppo have nothing to do with savages and pre-historic bearded freaks running rampant and demanding that their ridiculous interpretation (or should I say  Saudi  interpretation) of their religion be enforced by the blade of a dull knife. It couldn t be because the terrorists have prevented aid from reaching civilians and have actively prevented civilians from leaving East Aleppo to flee to the (*gasp!!) government-held areas. It couldn t be because of the Western sanctions on Syria. It couldn t be because the United States and its treacherous allies funded a proxy army of extremists to destroy the country.No, it s because the Syrian military dared bomb foreign terrorists in East Aleppo. CNN uses interesting logic, indeed.SEE ALSO: RESCUE REDUX: Are Syria s White Helmets  Recycling  its Child Victims?The article laughably uses the notorious terrorist support group known as the White Helmets as its source relaying all the  horrors  of the Assad  regime.  This has been typical of the corporate press in the West ever since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, i.e. using terrorist organizations to cite claims against the Syrian government. Generally speaking, these terrorists are labeled  activists  when a quote is needed but, in the case of the White Helmets, the label of  humanitarian organization  is tossed around, a much more effective propaganda technique.But what is even more deceitful is that CNN also labels the White Helmets and the Syria Civil Defense as the same organization, an absolute fallacy as Vanessa Beeley, the individual who is probably most responsible for exposing this propagandistic terrorist organization, can personally attest to, having met with members of the real Syria Civil Defense in Syria and hearing their stories about the terrorism of the White Helmets. Beeley has also interviewed a doctor with the Aleppo Medical Association who was responsible for assessing East Aleppo refugees who stated clearly that, despite being widely popular in the U.S., the people in East Aleppo simply don t know who the White Helmets are. For them, White Helmets are just another terrorist group.None of this matters to CNN, however, since the corporation is nothing but a mouthpiece for the U.S. State Department, Wall Street, and international corporations. It is, in fact, nothing more than a propaganda site.Perhaps CNN was one of the  fake news  sites that Obama was whining about during his latest trip to Germany . . . .Brandon Turbeville   article archive here   is the author of seven books, Codex Alimentarius   The End of Health Freedom, 7 Real Conspiracies, Five Sense Solutions and Dispatches From a Dissident, volume 1 andvolume 2, The Road to Damascus: The Anglo-American Assault on Syria, and The Difference it Makes: 36 Reasons Why Hillary Clinton Should Never Be President.

Colombian leader says received assurances of support from Republican U.S. lawmakers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said on Friday that Republican members of the U.S. Congress had indicated their continuing support for Colombia’s effort to achieve peace with leftist rebels and recover from years of civil war. His comments, at the State Department, came a day after President Barack Obama said he planned to ask Congress for more than $450 million in aid to help Colombia implement a peace accord to end Latin America’s longest war. Asked whether Republicans had backed the administration plan, Santos told reporters at the State Department he “did not hear one single voice” doubting the success of the current U.S. aid effort, Plan Colombia, and he had received “expressions of continuing support.” He said he did not receive any formal commitments but hoped Congress would support the new proposal.

LAND GRAB ALERT: Texas Rancher Could Lose 600 Acres To Feds [Video],"Another situation like the Bundy Ranch land grab has arisen in Texas the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) is claiming 600 acres of Ken Aderholt s land and is saying his deed to the land is no good. Mr. Aderholt has been a rancher on this property since 1941! The best hope for mr. Aderholt is if he puts up a big stink like Mr. Bundy did when people rallied for him. Ken Aderholt was born in Harrold, Texas, and grew up on the state border.Aderholt s family has been running cattle on land near the Red River since 1941. It has been running through generations and handed on down to me,  Aderholt said.His hope was that his two boys would be able to carry on the family business and tradition. They come down here a lot and play,  Aderholt explained.  They help with the cattle and help building fences. They are very interested in hanging round here and helping me out. But his land could soon be in the hands of the Bureau of Land Management. Aderholt, like many other Red River property owners, has been told that the land his family has owned for over 70 years is no longer his. The BLM is saying we should have never had a deed to it. That Texas should have never produced that deed,  Aderholt said.However, the second generation rancher isn t giving up his land without a fight. KAUZ-TV: Newschannel 6 Now | Wichita Falls, TXAderholt said the only land the BLM does have a right to is along the gradient boundary. It varies, the way the water washes and cuts into different properties, but it has always been just a little slither of property,  Aderholt said.According to the Bureau of Land Management, the true boundary is about half a mile inland, or roughly 600 of Aderholt s 1,250 acres.Aderholt s house is located inside the 600 acres the BLM wants to claim. While he s been notified the land could be taken, he has not been told what the U.S. government plans to do with it. It is a land grab,  Aderholt emphasized.

"“Without Coal, This State Is Nothing”…WEST VIRGINIA COAL MINERS SPEAK OUT…SUPPORT TRUMP"," We re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.    Hillary ClintonYes, that s exactly what Hillary Clinton said in March about the coal industry. She was following the Obama policy of shutting down the coal industry at all costs. She has since said she would spend federal dollars to retrain coal miners to do another job. The problem is that these men don t want to do that. The American people and voters in West Virginia had better realize what the loss of the coal industry would mean THIS IS PART OF A PIECE FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES SO READER BEWARE OF LIBERAL SPIN AND LIES HERE AND THERE POWELLTON, W.Va.   Deep in the belly of an Appalachian mountain, a powerful machine bored into the earth, its whirring teeth clawing out a stream of glistening coal. Men followed inside the Maple Eagle No. 1 mine, their torches cutting through the dank air. One guided the machine with a PlayStation-like controller; others bolted supports in the freshly cut roof.They were angry. The coal industry that made West Virginia prosperous has been devastated. Every day, it seemed, another mine laid off workers or closed entirely. Friends were forfeiting their cars, homes and futures.For these men, this season s presidential campaign boils down to a single choice.  I m for Trump,  said Dwayne Riston, 27, his face smeared in dust.  Way I see it, if he wins, we might at least stand a chance of surviving. Few places in America offer such a simple electoral calculus as the rolling, tree-studded hills of West Virginia.Even as Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, lags badly in crucial swing states and loses his grip on white male voters over all, he remains on solid ground here with his promise to  bring back coal.  The fact that his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, said in March,  We re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,  has helped, too.But this is not just about economics. West Virginia s coal country is part of the broader white, working-class vote that has coalesced around a single candidate, Mr. Trump, like never before. His support here stems from a profound, decades-in-the-making sense of political and cultural alienation that has left people feeling distant from their leaders, and even from fellow Americans. I kind of feel that people are looking down on us,  said Neil Hanshew, a miner, voicing a common sentiment.  They re looking at us like we re a bunch of dumb hillbillies who can t do anything else.

Yet, he s never won an Oscar   that is until Sunday night. Leonardo DiCaprio took in Best Actor at the 88th Annual Academy Awards Sunday night for his role in The Revenant. DiCaprio used the moment to highlight an issue that Republicans have refused to acknowledge: climate change. He said:The Reverent was about man s relationship with the world. 2015 was the hottest year in recorded history. Our production team needed to go to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together, and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyp_DVgT260]It was a night already fueled with emotion and tension after the Academy Awards were called out for not having any African American nominees.

Climate change is one of many pressing issues that separate Republicans and Democrats and it makes this election year vital for future policies on climate change.

"Ryan hopes to combine DACA, border security in immigration bill: NYT interview","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he hoped to see compromise immigration reform that combines border security measures with protections for immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children. President Donald Trump on Tuesday ended a program for so-called Dreamers and gave Congress six months to find a legislative fix. In a New York Times interview on Thursday, Ryan was asked if he would put the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to a vote. “I’m going to put a consensus plan on the floor, because I want members of Congress in both parties to talk to each other and find consensus on this issue.” Ryan said the DACA issue was a symptom of failure of security at U.S. borders. “It is only reasonable that while fixing this serious real problem, we also try to address the root cause of that problem. And that is border security,” he said. “That is where I think the consensus lies.” ",politicsNews,"September 7, 2017 ",1,1058
Obamacare 2018 enrollment clouded by uncertainty under Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Americans began signing up for Obamacare health insurance plans on Wednesday, experts expected reduced participation as a bitter political debate clouds the program’s future.      Republicans in Congress have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which they have said drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. Democrats have warned that repeal would leave millions of Americans without health coverage.  President Donald Trump promised to kill Obama’s Affordable Care Act in his 2016 election campaign, and has taken steps to undermine a law he has declared “dead” and “imploding”. Trump’s administration cut Obamacare advertising by 90 percent and shortened the enrollment period by half.  “The market’s going to be extremely confusing. There’s going to be entire complexity of choice,” said David Anderson, a health policy researcher at Duke University.  Obama took to social media on Wednesday, encouraging Americans who need insurance to sign up on the federal Healthcare.gov website. He stressed that government tax credits would keep coverage affordable for most.  Obama asked people to get out the word, “because this country works best when we look out for one another.” A new Trump ad, paid for by the Republican National Committee, blamed Democrats for Obamacare’s “skyrocketing” insurance premiums and for blocking efforts to repeal the law.      Obamacare advocates have warned that sign-ups for individual insurance coverage under the law could drop by about one million people in 2018 compared with 2017. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that four million fewer people will sign up for Obamacare private insurance than previously forecast due to Trump policies.  Still, CBO expects total enrollment to reach 11 million in 2018, up from the around 10 million who obtained and paid for coverage in 2017. Administration officials could not immediately say when 2018 enrollment data would be made public.  The Trump administration has cut the 2018 enrollment period in half to six weeks from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 for states using the federal Healthcare.gov website. Enrollment previously ran until Jan. 31, and many consumers tended to sign up in the last two weeks, according to state officials and organizations that help people choose insurance. The administration has also cut off billions of dollars in subsidies that insurers use to discount out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income Americans and cut funding to groups that help people enroll in health insurance.  Several insurers have exited Obamacare markets due to concerns over subsidies and other Trump actions. Those that remained raised monthly premium prices to account for the lost government subsidies. Senate Republicans and Democrats are working on legislation to stabilize Obamacare markets in the short term, including restoring the subsidies. But Trump has sought more far-reaching changes, and urged Republicans to take up full-scale repeal again in the coming months.      The Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that premiums for the most popular Obamacare plans would rise 37 percent in 2018. Americans eligible for Obamacare tax credits to buy insurance may pay less for coverage, but middle-class consumers who do not get subsidies will face much higher prices for these plans. “It’s been such a flood of information. A lot of the population thinks the Affordable Care Act has already been put under,” said Daniel Polsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. “The strange premium increases are going to be very confusing for consumers.” The Trump administration is now planning changes for 2019. Last week, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance. Under Obamacare, all insurers have to cover a set of 10 benefits, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.  ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2017 ",1,4119
Key lawmaker calls Trump defense budget request low,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee called President Donald Trump’s reported $603 billion defense budget request low on Monday, a sign of the fight ahead between Trump’s party and Democrats, who oppose slashing non-military spending to boost Pentagon funding. “Over the course of the Obama Administration, our military funding was cut 20 percent while the world grew more dangerous. While we cannot repair all of the damage done by those cuts in a single year, we can and should do more than this level of funding will allow,” Representative Mac Thornberry said in a statement. “The administration will have to make clear which problems facing our military they are choosing not to fix,” he said.

"In hats and t-shirts, Trump fans rally in Jerusalem's Old City","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel’s best friend if elected. Wearing “Make America Great Again” baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn’t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. “Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that’s what I like,” David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. “He’s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He’s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he’s not going to support the two-state solution,” he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. Trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. Others at the rally said they liked the fact that Trump was promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and would not berate Israel for building Jewish settlements in occupied territory. “It’s very important that he becomes president,” said Connie Gordner, 82, who moved to Israel from Jacksonville, Florida, 21 years ago. “If Hillary Clinton becomes president, we’re dead.” The rally was organized by Republicans Overseas Israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 U.S. citizens living in Israel or in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for their own state. Even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come Nov. 8. Marc Zell, co-chairman of the non-profit group, believes around three-quarters of American-Israelis support the Republican party and its candidate. In an impassioned speech to the small crowd, David Friedman, Trump’s adviser on Israel, heaped criticism on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said Trump was Israel’s greatest hope. “Under Trump, the United States will never pressure Israel into accepting a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the Israeli people,” he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of “Crooked Hillary”. While the motley crowd was unabashed in its Trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most Jewish Israelis favor Clinton over Trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. The critical element is American-Israelis who retain the right to vote in U.S. elections. Some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national-religious outlook. Trump’s messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. On Wednesday, he delivered a minute-long video to the rally, playing up his connections to Judaism through his daughter’s marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. “My administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israel’s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis,” he said. “Together we will make America and Israel safe again.” ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1,3511
"With healthcare bill dead, Republicans turn to taxes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After failing to repeal Obamacare, Republicans in the U.S. Congress quickly pivoted on Friday to President Donald Trump’s next priority: overhauling the federal tax code, but their plan has already split the business community. Division among Republicans was the chief cause of the embarrassing setback on Obamacare, and similar fault lines have been evident for months in the Republicans’ tax plan, mainly over an untested proposal to use the tax code to boost exports. House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady conceded the demise of a Republican plan to roll back Obamacare could make the path to tax reform harder. “This made a big challenge more challenging. But it’s not insurmountable,” he told Fox News after Ryan canceled a vote on an Obamacare rollback bill. But Brady said he and House Speaker Paul Ryan are all-in on tax reform. Brady said House Republicans plan to begin moving on tax reform this spring and to pass legislation before Congress’s summer recess in late July. “We’re going to work with the administration to get this done,” he said. Trump has been unclear about his position on the most problematic feature of the House Republicans’ tax “blueprint,” a proposal known as the border adjustment tax that would cut taxes on exports and raise them on imports.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that tax reform in many ways is “a lot simpler” than healthcare reform. “We’re able to take the tax code and redesign things and I think there is very, very strong support,” Mnuchin said at an event hosted by news website Axios. Comprehensive tax reform is a policy goal so complex that it has defied successive Congresses and presidents since 1986 when it was last accomplished under former President Ronald Reagan. The U.S. tax code is riddled with narrow subsidies and loopholes, many of them deeply embedded in the economy and defended by the interests they benefit, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the business interest deductibility. Brady’s panel has been working on a plan since mid-2016 that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, end taxing foreign profits for U.S.-based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors. The plan has divided businesses, prompting import-dependent industries to warn of higher prices for consumer goods from clothing and electronics to gasoline. Brady has been adamant that border adjustment will be part of the House tax reform, saying earlier this week that the provision was “a given” for final legislation but would include a transition period for import-heavy industries.

"Climate change should not be 'partisan issue,' Kerry says","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - Work to avert the problems caused by climate change should not be a partisan issue, outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told students at an elite U.S. engineering school on Monday, in one of his final speeches as the nation’s top diplomat. Kerry noted U.S. officials from military and intelligence leaders to the mayors of coastal cities agree the problem of rising sea levels and erratic rainfall is one that they want to take action on, and he urged the incoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump to tackle head on. Trump, a New York real estate developer who has never held elected office, has described climate change as a hoax and vowed to pull the United States out of the deal negotiated in Paris in 2015 to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. But in an interview with the New York Times in November, Trump said he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of the accord. “I’m not going to speculate about the policies that our President-elect and his Secretary of State will choose to pursue, but I will tell you this ... some issues look a lot different when you’re actually in office compared to when you’re on the campaign trail,” Kerry said at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.  “The truth is that climate change shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It’s an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation.” The U.S. Senate this week is due to begin the process of confirming Trump’s political appointments, including proposed Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, who has repeatedly challenged the agency’s authority in the courts. Many Republicans in Congress argue environmental regulations slow business growth and job creation, both expected to be top priorities for the Trump administration. Kerry referenced a U.S. intelligence report published on Monday that listed climate change among the factors that could raise the risk of conflict between nations. Obama on Monday echoed the message in an article published in Science magazine.  Kerry called on researchers and students at MIT to keep up their work on improving energy efficiency and inventing new energy sources, regardless of government policies. “It’s going to be innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders ... who will continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way we power our world,” Kerry said. “Every person in this room – indeed, every person on the planet – has an interest in making sure that transition happens as quickly as possible.” ",politicsNews,"January 9, 2017 ",1,2689
Trump says he will get into 'great detail' on tax reform in next two weeks,"MANDAN, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would get into “great detail” in the next two weeks on his U.S. tax reform plan, which has been short on specifics, even after months of discussions among administration and congressional leaders. Trump, at a speech in North Dakota, listed his broad principles for tax reform as simplifying the U.S. tax code and providing tax relief to middle-class Americans, ideas he has been talking about since his 2016 presidential campaign. “We’re going to get into great detail over the next two weeks, but we’re working on it with Congress now and coming up with very exacting numbers,” Trump said. The U.S. stock market rallied earlier this year on hopes of swift tax cuts for businesses under Trump, but analysts have since reduced expectations for major tax changes this year. The Republican party is still divided on significant issues, such as whether or not tax cuts should be offset with spending cuts to avoid expanding the federal budget deficit and how deeply to cut the corporate income tax rate.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accompanied Trump on the trip, said he expected the administration’s tax plan to be considered by congressional committees later this month. “We have a plan. The plan’s being socialized with members,” Mnuchin told reporters on Air Force One on the return to Washington. “Our expectation is it will be in the (congressional) committees later this month,” he said. Mnuchin is one of a six-member Republican team that has been negotiating a tax plan behind closed doors for months, excluding Democrats and producing only a few pages of basic principles. Some members of the team have recently tangled with Trump. Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn is also a member of the “Big Six” team. According to sources close to the White House and an administration official, Trump has soured on nominating Cohn to lead the Federal Reserve.  That comes, two sources said, since Cohn criticized the president’s response to the violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month. McConnell, leader of the Republicans in the U.S. Senate, is also a Big Six team member. McConnell was attacked repeatedly last month by Trump on Twitter over Congress’s failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota flew with Trump to her home state for the speech and was called on stage by the president along with Republican officials. “Everybody’s saying, ‘What’s she doing up here?’” Trump said. “But I’ll tell you what: Good woman, and I think we’ll have your support.” Trump is trying to persuade Democrats to support his push to cut tax rates and simplify the tax code this year, a plan critical to bolstering Republicans heading into 2018 midterm elections, but which so far has included few details. Heitkamp said in a statement that having Trump visit North Dakota was a good opportunity for the state to explain its priorities. She said she was “open to working with Republicans and Democrats on comprehensive, permanent tax reform”, but she cautioned that “the devil is in the details.”  The White House plans to put Trump out on the road on a near-weekly basis this fall to sell his plan, which faces huge obstacles in Congress. Republicans control Congress but have so far been unable to pass Trump’s top legislative priorities. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2017 ",1,3481
Driver charged with attempted murder over Australian vehicle attack,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The man accused of deliberately plowing into Christmas shoppers on a busy street in the Australian city of Melbourne was charged on Saturday with 18 counts of attempted murder and one count of conduct endangering life. The Thursday incident was the second serious vehicle attack in Australia s second biggest city this year. Police said they had charged the man, former Afghanistan refugee Saeed Noori, after formally interviewing him about the attack that police had earlier described as a  deliberate act . Police have said Noori, 32, is known to have mental health problems and to use drugs and they did not believe the attack was terrorism-related. Police suspect Noori was behind the wheel of a white SUV when he deliberately sped up and drove into dozens of pedestrians crossing the road at one of the busiest intersections in Melbourne s central business district. Noori appeared in the Magistrates Court later on Saturday where he was remanded in custody. He will next appear in court on Wednesday. The court also ordered that Noori be assessed by psychologists. Islamist militants have used vehicles to attack people several times in Europe and the United States over the past couple of years. In January, six people were killed in Melbourne s central business district when a man used his vehicle to mow them down. Police also ruled out terrorism for that attack. Following the January incident, authorities installed 140 concrete bollards in the city center. Victoria State premier Daniel Andrews said 12 people remained in hospital, including three who in critical condition. He said there would be an increased police presence at Melbourne events, including the Boxing Day Test Cricket, carols and other major sports events.   ",worldnews,"December 23, 2017 ",1,1829
"Amsterdam mayor Van der Laan, who once snubbed Putin, dies of cancer","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Eberhard van der Laan, Amsterdam s popular mayor, has died of lung cancer, the city said on Friday.  Van der Laan informed city residents of his illness in January, saying the prognosis left  little reason for optimism . When he retreated from public life three weeks ago, thousands gathered in front of his canal-side house to applaud for several minutes in a display of support. Van der Laan, 62, was known as an effective, pragmatic and sometimes combative mayor with a sense of humor.  When an  Occupy  tent camp arose in front of the stock market in October 2011, Van der Laan was a frequent visitor, engaging protesters in discussion. He allowed the tents to remain until a court ordered them cleared months later. One of his most remarkable moments on an international stage was in 2013 when Van der Laan said he was too busy to meet Vladimir Putin during the Russian president s visit to Amsterdam, and ordered a rainbow flag flown from city hall in protest at Russian policies against homosexuals.  The former lawyer served briefly as housing minister and shortly after becoming mayor in 2010 enforced a law banning squatting, sparking minor riots and banishing a long Amsterdam tradition to the fringes. Van der Laan is survived by his wife and five children from two marriages. ",worldnews,"October 6, 2017 ",1,1379
Tension rises as Australia starts to dismantle Papua New Guinea detention center,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian private security on Tuesday vacated an asylum seeker detention center in Papua New Guinea (PNG) ahead of its planned closure, detainees said, leaving about 600 refugees and asylum seekers barricaded inside and refusing to move. Detainees are defying attempts by Australia and PNG to close the controversial Manus Island center, saying they fear violent reprisals from the local community if they move to a transit center. Despite threats that water and power supply to the camp would be cut by 5 p.m. (0700 GMT), asylum-seekers told Reuters after the deadline that half the camp still had power at 10.30 p.m. (1230 GMT), along with access to water.  The Manus center has been a key part of Australia s controversial  Sovereign Borders  immigration policy. The country refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. Lawyers for some of the 600 men filed a last-minute lawsuit in PNG to prevent the camp s closure and allow the men to be relocated to a third country. A ruling is expected on Wednesday. The detainees were left alone for the first time in more than four years after camp staff all left on Tuesday morning, Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz told Reuters.  The water and electricity are still on but we are vulnerable now after the staff left us all alone,  Aziz said. The camp s impending closure is part of an Australian government plan to push refugees and asylum seekers to return to their home country, settle in PNG or move elsewhere, so dismantling part of the costly and controversial offshore detention program. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers. Detainees have consistently raised concerns over how they are treated by locals and authorities in PNG, a country that ranks 154th out of 185 on the United Nation s Human Development Index. Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton refused to comment on the departure of the Australian-employed security staff on Manus, but said the camp s closure would proceed.  All have been informed for a considerable period of time that there is safe and secure alternate accommodation where health and other services will be maintained,  Dutton said in an emailed statement. Australia has already said it would spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) to house the men for the next 12 months. Just under 200 men have already been moved.  The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal. Asylum seekers said several unidentified local men had arrived at the camp and taken away furniture from common areas. Videos images shot by the refugees and sent to Reuters show vans loaded with furniture departing, though it is not clear where the vehicles were from. Conditions for the refugees were unbearable, said Nick McKim, a senator with the Australian Greens Party who is on Manus.   I can only describe what is happening on Manus now as a humanitarian emergency,  McKim told Reuters.  It is 31 degrees Celsius (88 Fahrenheit) today and drinking water will be cut off.  PNG has sent paramilitary services to oversee the closure.  PNG s High Court ruled last year that the Manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal. Most of the detainees come from war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria. Australia s tough offshore detention policies are backed by its two biggest political parties, although community opinion is divided.  I would be absolutely terrified to be in that situation and I cannot understand why the government just simply will not say enough is enough ... we need to bring them here to Australia,  said refugee advocate Dr Barri Phatarfod, who joined in a small protest against refugee policies in Sydney on Tuesday.

Group sues Trump for repealing U.S. wildlife rule in rare legal challenge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An environmental group sued President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday over the repeal of a U.S. rule intended to protect wildlife, in the first court challenge to a law being used by Republicans to ease federal regulation. In February, the Republican-controlled Congress used the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to dismantle a rule that the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama finalized in August to limit hunting on federal lands in Alaska. The rule had exempted wolves and bears from Alaska’s plans to control predators, which included killing wolves and their pups in their dens and shooting bears from planes.  The CRA only requires simple majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate and the president’s signature to wipe newly minted regulations off the books.   In the federal court lawsuit, which likely has little chance of success, the Center for Biological Diversity said the CRA violated the U.S. Constitution because it barred regulators in the future from enacting “substantially similar” rules to the ones repealed.   “The Congressional Review Act throws the balance of power out of whack and opens the door for politicians in Congress to meddle in decisions that ought to be made by experts at federal agencies,” said Collette Adkins, a biologist and attorney at the center. “By law the Fish and Wildlife Service must protect biological diversity on Alaskan wildlife refuges. But the act makes it more difficult for agency officials to carry out their legal duty,” she said in a statement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CRA, drafted in 1996, has a structure and language that abide by what the U.S. Supreme Court said in the case INS v. Chadha, likely making it constitutional, said Karl Manheim, professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Since Feb. 1, Trump has signed 13 congressional resolutions repealing rules on the environment, education, gun control, corruption and family planning. Most advocacy groups that had tried to block the resolutions said this week they were not intending to file similar suits.  “Unfortunately I don’t think there’s an avenue for courts to overturn a CRA resolution,” said Alison Zieve who works in litigation for the liberal Public Citizen group.

"Let me come back, Catalan leader tells Spain","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Catalonia s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont called on Spain s government on Saturday to allow him to return home in time for the opening session of the Catalan parliament so that he can become the region s next president. Puigdemont, who ruled in Catalonia until October and faces arrest in Spain for his role in organizing an illegal referendum on independence and proclaiming a Catalan republic, is currently in self-imposed exile in Belgium. Separatist parties secured a parliamentary majority in a regional election on Thursday, though it is still unclear whether Puigdemont and other jailed leaders of the movement will be able to attend assembly sessions.   I want to come back to Catalonia as soon as possible. I would like to come back right now. It would be good news for Spain,  Puigdemont told Reuters in an interview. Asked if he would be back in time for the opening session which has to take place at the latest on January 23, he said:  It would be natural. If I am not allowed to be sworn in as president, it would be a major abnormality for the Spanish democratic system.   I am the president of the regional government and I will remain the president if the Spanish state respects the results of the vote,  he also said. Puigdemont, who has called for dialogue with the Spanish government to resolve the current tensions between the turbulent region and the authorities in Madrid, said he was ready to listen to any proposal from Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy even if this offer fell short of an offer of independence.  If the Spanish state has a proposal for Catalonia, we should listen,  Puigdemont said, asking for a dialogue of equals. Rajoy on Friday said he was open to dialogue but implicitly rejected Puigdemont s demand to meet soon, saying he would talk with whoever was Catalonia s president only once they have been elected by the new regional parliament.  Before that, his first interlocutor should be Ines Arrimadas, whose centrist, anti-independence party scored most votes on Thursday, he said. Arrimadas does not have enough seats or allies to form a government, while separatist parties put together have a narrow majority. Past calls for dialogue on both the separatist and unionist side in the past have failed to yield concrete results and the crisis is likely to keep haunting Madrid, as well as EU leaders, for a long time. Negotiations to form a government in Catalonia are likely to open after Jan. 6 following the holiday break. Parliament must vote by Feb. 8 on putting a new government into place.

Google supports U.S. efforts to disclose buyers of online political ads,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google unit told U.S. election regulators in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday that it “strongly supports” tightening rules on online political advertising as part of efforts to curtail “foreign abuse and influence” in elections. Federal lawmakers have criticized Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc for not doing enough to identify and block Russian agents from buying ads on their services. U.S. authorities say the ads were intended to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. law permits foreign entities to advertise about certain issues if they disclose such spending, but it is unlawful for them to interfere in elections. In September, the Federal Election Commission, which sets campaign finance rules, voted to consider ensuring that those disclosure rules apply to online activity. It opened a public comment period that is set to expire Monday. In the letter, Google on Thursday offered its formal response to the FEC’s deliberation.  “Now more than ever, we must work together to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse and influence in U.S. elections,” the company wrote.  The stance marks an about-face from 2010 when Google sought an affirmative exemption from a requirement that an ad should state who purchased it. The commission did not reach a consensus on the exemption at the time. Google now is calling on the commission to extend disclosure rules that apply to TV and print ads to the Web. “Google strongly supports the commission’s proposal to proceed with a rulemaking so that the commission can provide the clarity that campaigns and other political advertisers need to determine what disclaimers they are required to include.” The company, which is the world’s top seller of online ads, also asked federal regulators and lawmakers to expand restrictions on foreign participation in elections to cover content distributed and advertised on the Internet.  Ratifying such provisions could give tech companies guidance on how to treat soft influence, or content from organizations such as RT, a Russian news outlet that has drawn concerns from lawmakers for peddling propaganda on Facebook and Google’s YouTube service. In its letter, Google also reiterated plans to offer the public a database of election ads purchased through its service. In addition, the company has said information about buyers would be more accessible.  Technology news website Recode first reported the Google letter. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2017 ",1,2580
HERE’S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY People Don’t Trust Muslims Living In Their Communities,"The massive shroud of secrecy in Muslim communities around the world is what causes people to question the motives of every Muslim. Aren t non-violent Muslims who say they wouldn t report a terror plot as culpable as the radical Muslims who commit acts of terror?  A new ICM poll has discovered two out of three Muslims in Britain would not give the government any information if they knew details about a terror plot.These disturbing poll results seem to indicate the government s counter-terrorism program, named Prevent, is unlikely to provide much usable information on active threats, if it passes along any information at all, The Express reports.The results also suggest the existence of a society deep inside Britain that is fundamentally opposed to its values and will actively subvert the government to protect its own members. Further questions in the survey revealed even more evidence that Muslims diverge entirely from British norms.For example, over 50 percent of Muslims think homosexuality should be illegal. A total of 23 percent of Muslims want Sharia law to become the dominant legal system in the country. Exactly 31 percent are completely comfortable with one man having multiple wives. Via: Daily CallerOn the bright side, 1/3 of British Muslims said they would report a terror plot.  ",politics,"Apr 13, 2016",0,1394

Lavrov says wild that Trump Jr. blamed for meeting Russian lawyer,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday it was preposterous that U.S. President Donald Trump’s eldest son was blamed for meeting a Russian lawyer who emails suggest might have had damaging information about Hillary Clinton last year. Hitting back against accusations of Russian meddling in the 206 U.S. elections, Lavrov asked to be shown “at least one fact” proving Moscow tried to interfere with the democratic process.  “I learned with surprise that a Russian lawyer, a woman, is being blamed and Trump’s son is being blamed for meeting. For me, this is wild,” Lavrov told a joint news conference with his Belgian counterpart in Brussels.     “Because when any person speaks to a lawyer, what problem or threat could there be? I didn’t know about this, I learned about it from television.” The emails released by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday are seen by Trump critics as the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election. But Lavrov dismissed the media interest in the email release, saying: “It’s amazing that serious people are making a mountain out of a molehill.” ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2017 ",1,1226
 Republicans Say Trump MUST Stop Pushing This Conspiracy Theory Or People Will Get Hurt,"The Republican civil war is heating up as members of the party have begun an all-out campaign to stop their own presidential nominee from causing harm to the country. That (probably futile) battle is taking shape as Republicans are now asking Trump to stop claiming that the election is  rigged. Somebody claiming in the election,  I was defrauded , that isn t going to cut it,  said former Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican who earlier in the campaign had endorsed Jeb Bush and then Marco Rubio.  They re going to have to say how, where, why, when. I don t think leading candidates for the presidency should undercut the process unless you have a really good reason,  Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who gained little support for his own 2016 White House run, told POLITICO.Like the Trump campaign itself, this is another case of Republicans now being forced to reap what they have sown. For years they have pushed the idea that voter fraud is rampant, when in reality it is almost nonexistent.Now Trump is using those fears   especially of black voters in urban areas   to scare his supporters and set up a reason to wail and cry if he loses the election.In fact, the current polling indicates that Hillary Clinton is favored to win, and in all the swing states key to an election victory she has a far bigger and better funded operation to get out the vote. Trump has tried to create a national political operation on the cheap, preferring to spend money on his own companies rather than invest in a  ground game. As a result, Trump is heavily relying on state parties, who tend to prioritize House and Senate races over the presidential contest, and do not have the kind of money on hand to properly equip a presidential campaign.Featured image via Flickr",News,"October 11, 2016",0,1868
White House vows quick action as Harvey aid estimates soar,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Estimates of the size of a Hurricane Harvey aid package for Texas and Louisiana rose on Thursday, with one proposal being drafted for $150 billion, while the White House promised to make a request for funding soon to Congress. The Trump administration will make a request to the U.S. Congress shortly for funds to help recovery efforts from Harvey, which caused devastating flooding, White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said. He told reporters that an aid funding request will likely come in stages as more is known about the storm’s impact. Trump has prepared a request to Congress for an initial $5.9 billion in aid, an administration official said.  U.S. taxpayers are likely to face a bill for Harvey near the $110.2 billion for 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. Estimates on the amount of the Harvey aid varied widely. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Houston, was crafting legislation for $150 billion in emergency funding through nearly two-dozen government agencies and departments.  Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Wednesday the state could need more than $125 billion. Figures of $50 billion to $80 billion were cited by Republican Representatives Pete Sessions of Texas and Leonard Lance of New Jersey on Fox Business Network. The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund had only $3.3 billion when the storm struck. A Republican leadership source said Congress was expected to consider and vote on an initial allocation of Harvey aid in the first half of September. The urgency of aiding areas hit by Harvey may also complicate a broader fiscal policy showdown that is coming in late September. When Harvey plowed into the Texas coast this week, Congress and President Donald Trump were already struggling to deal with the debt ceiling, which is a cap on how much money the federal government can borrow, and the need to approve a temporary federal budget bill by Oct. 1 to prevent a government shutdown. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told broadcaster CNBC on Thursday that the impact of Hurricane Harvey spending could bring forward the deadline by which the nation’s debt ceiling needs to be raised by “a couple of days.” He repeated that the limit needs to be raised by Sept. 29 Financial markets have been anxious about the possibility of the debt ceiling not being raised, which could cause a U.S. credit default and send economic shockwaves worldwide. A Trump administration official and a prominent House of Representatives conservative both said on Thursday that hurricane aid funding should not be tied to the debt limit. Bossert said the administration wants a “clean” disaster relief supplemental measure, free of unrelated measures, including any effort to raise the federal debt ceiling.  Representative Mark Meadows, the Republican chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told the Washington Post that attaching Harvey aid to a debt-ceiling increase would be a “terrible idea ... conflating two very different issues.” Meadows told the Post, “We’re going to fund Harvey relief without a doubt, but I think it just sends the wrong message when you start attaching it to the debt ceiling.” That left open the possibility that the aid package could be linked to a broad, short-term budget measure that must pass by Oct. 1 to prevent a government shutdown. The prospect of that linkage was seen as making a government shutdown less likely because of the urgency of getting aid to hurricane-hit areas, and that has been reassuring to financial markets. Asked if there was still a chance of a shutdown, House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News Channel on Thursday, “We are going to keep this government open, we are going to pay our debts on time.” ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2017 ",1,3824

SERIOUSLY? Mexico Is Threatening Texas With A Law Suit?,"This is the result of weak leadership in the White House. Watch for a copycat lawsuit to be filed against Florida by our new  friends  in Cuba in 5 4 3 2..1 The Mexican government is warning that Texas  denial of birth certificates for U.S. children born here to undocumented immigrants stands to imperil the relationship between Mexico and the Lone Star State.The concern was raised in an amicus brief filed Monday evening to lend support to immigrants parents who sued Texas after being denied birth certificates for their U.S.-born children, even after showing their  matr culas,  the ID cards issued by the Mexican Consulate to undocumented immigrants.Mexico says the practice stands in stark contrast to the historical practice among countries to accept passports or other forms of ID to issue birth certificates. [It] not only jeopardizes their dignity and well-being, but could threaten the unique relationship between Mexico and Texas,  the Mexican government said in a brief tied to a lawsuit filed against the state by Texas Civil Rights Project and Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid.The lawsuit, the Texas Tribune reported, was filed on behalf of six U.S. citizen children and their undocumented parents, who came from Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. Other groups since have joined the suit.A main point of contention is the all-out refusal at some county registrars offices to accept as a valid form of ID anything short of a U.S. visa or consulate ID card, the Tribune said.The families who are suing say that Texas is violating the 14th amendment and that the state is superseding federal immigration laws.Texas officials are claiming sovereignty issues and argue that the United States cannot fight them.They long have said that consulate-issued identification cards are not considered reliable forms of ID.The Mexican government is requesting that Texas be clear about what two forms of ID it will accept in order to give the children U.S. birth certificate. Our argument isn t  yes matr cula, no matr cula,  said attorney Jennifer Harbury, who represents the families, to the Tribune.  The argument is  what will you take that people can actually get?  They have to take something. [The children] were born here. They are U.S. citizens. The amicus brief also claims that denying the children U.S. birth certificates blocks their claims to Mexican citizenship. A child born to Mexican parents has that right but must show proof of identity. Infringing on that is a violation of international law, the brief states.Mexican Consulate officials argue that the matr cula is, in many ways, more secure because it includes biometric technology, unlike the driver s licenses in some states.They say a parent s undocumented status should not affect a child s ability to obtain a birth certificate. We think that they are not immigration authorities,  said Consul Carlos Gonz lez Guti rrez from the Mexican Consulate General s office in Austin.

U.S. senators release final sentencing reform bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A revised criminal justice reform bill moved closer to a full U.S. Senate vote on Thursday when it gained support from more Republicans after being stalled for months in Congress. In a legacy-shaping issue for President Barack Obama, the measure’s sponsors announced four new Republican co-sponsor senators and a new version of the bill at a press conference in the Senate. The measure now has 37 co-sponsors, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley. Grassley said he had been waiting for the bill to be finalized before asking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring it up for a full Senate vote, but that “it is time for those discussions to start right now.” As revised, it still lowers mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, but it no longer applies to anyone convicted of a serious violent felony. That change was a response to conservative critics of the bill, which is central to Obama’s efforts to overhaul the country’s federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding. That effort has been a rare example of Republican and Democratic agreement in the polarized Congress.   The bill’s advocates have said they hope the revisions and new co-sponsors, such as Republican senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Steve Daines of Montana, will convince McConnell to bring up the bill for a Senate vote. Daines and Kirk lent their support after adding minor requirements, including a provision that savings from it go toward purposes such as fighting gangs of national significance. After a group of conservative Republican senators led by Tom Cotton of Arkansas claimed in January the reforms would release violent felons, the bill’s authors began excising parts of the proposal that eased the sentences of violent criminals.  The bill now includes a new mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving the opiate fentanyl, mirroring parallel sentencing reforms that await a floor vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. The House legislation is likely to contain changes to “mens rea” laws that govern criminal intent, said Senator John Cornyn, a sponsor of the Senate bill, at Thursday’s press conference.  Mens rea reform was excluded from the Senate measure because its authors were divided on the issue. Democratic lawmakers generally oppose strengthening mens rea requirements on the grounds it would enable more corporate malfeasance as it is difficult to prove the “intent” of a corporation. To exclude violent criminals from the Senate bill, the authors removed a section that lowered minimum sentences for unlawful gun owners with three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, known as “armed career criminals.”  Such criminals represent nearly a fifth of the 12,908 current inmates who would have been eligible for resentencing under the old bill, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

TREY GOWDY ON CROOKED DNC: ‘There May Be Something The DNC Didn’t Want Law Enforcement to See In Hacked Server [Video],"Rep. Trey Gowdy was full of sarcasm (rightfully so) during comments about why the DNC didn t turn over its hacked computer server to authorities. The puzzling thing that raised red flags is that the organization said it never received federal assistance causing people to question whether the DNC had something it  didn t want law enforcement to see. Congressman Gowdy spoke with FOX News  Martha MacCallum about why the DNC did not turn over its server to the DHS or FBI officials who could have helped to prevent future hackings:The DNC was hacked during the 2016 election and  emails were published by WikiLeaks. JKeh Johnson, former DHS Secretary, testified yesterday that the DNC didn t need help after the hacks.Then this shocker after Johnson s testimony,  Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that while she was chair of the DNC, she was never contacted by any federal agency, including DHS and the FBI, about the hack.Gowdy goes on to refer to his career as a prosecutor by implying that it appeared as though the DNC had something to hide: Let me hazard a wild guess: that there may be something else on that server they didn t want law enforcement to see?

Supreme Court invalidates gender inequality in citizenship law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down a gender distinction in U.S. immigration law that treats mothers and fathers differently when determining a child’s citizenship, calling such inequality “stunningly anachronistic.” The high court, in a 8-0 ruling authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, found that a provision in federal law that defines how people born overseas can be eligible for U.S. citizenship violated the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection guarantee.  The ruling, however, may not help the man who brought the case, New York resident Luis Morales-Santana, who was seeking to avoid deportation to the Dominican Republic after being convicted of several offenses. The law requires that unwed fathers who are American citizens spend at least five years living in the United States - a 2012 amendment reduced it from 10 years - before they can confer citizenship to a child born abroad, out of wedlock and to a partner who is not a U.S. citizen. For unwed U.S. mothers in the same situation, the requirement was only one year. In the ruling, the Supreme Court said that until Congress revises the law, both women and men will be covered by the five-year requirement. Ginsburg, known for her work on gender equality before she became a jurist, wrote for the court that in light of the Supreme Court’s various rulings regarding the equal protection guarantee since 1971, having separate “duration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers who have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly anachronistic.” The arguments made in defense of the law by former President Barack Obama’s administration before he left office in January “cannot withstand inspection under a Constitution that requires the government to respect the equal dignity and stature of its male and female citizens,” Ginsburg wrote. Morales-Santana’s deceased father was an American citizen, while his mother was not. His father failed to meet the law’s five-year requirements by 20 days. His lawyer, Stephen Broome, said he is reviewing how the ruling affects his client. Morales-Santana, 54, was born in the Dominican Republican and has lived legally in the United States since 1975. He was convicted of several criminal offenses in 1995, including two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted murder. The U.S. government has sought to deport him since 2000. The high court split 4-4 on the same issue in 2011. In July 2015, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York sided with Morales-Santana and struck down the law at issue, saying it applied “impermissible stereotyping” in imposing a tougher burden on fathers. The U.S. Justice Department sought to defend the law and asked the high court to take the case. The case is one of several with immigration-related themes that are before the justices at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration is pursing efforts to strengthen immigration enforcement.

 Civil Rights Hero Nearly Killed By KKK Has A Warning About Donald Trump,"Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) was nearly killed by the Ku Klux Klan while helping to lead the Freedom Rides in Alabama in 1961. He knows the destructive power of racist hatred first hand, and he is now warning about the forces that have been stirred up by the divisive presidential campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump. I ve been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did,  Lewis said in an interview with The Times after speaking at Cal State L.A.  I think demagogues are pretty dangerous, really.   We shouldn t divide people, we shouldn t separate people. Sometimes I feel like I am reliving part of my past. I heard it so much growing up in the South,  he said.  I heard it so much during the days of the civil rights movement. As a people, I just think we could do much better. Trump launched his campaign with a divisive message of racism, accusing Mexicans of being criminals and  rapists.  Since then, it has gotten worse. Trump-inspired thugs have attacked Latinos. His campaign supporters have   on multiple occasions   attacked black demonstrators at Trump s own rallies, sometimes egged on by the candidate himself. And Trump has also proposed a ban on Muslim travel to the United States.As former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Rep. Lewis is the last of the  big six  leaders of the Civil Rights Movement still alive (the others are Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young).Lewis was attacked by the KKK while participating in the Freedom Rides, buses of young activists that went to register black voters in segregated Alabama. The Klan deflated the tires of the bus he was on and forced it to stop. They attacked Lewis and the other riders, beating them for trying to accomplish their peaceful mission. Speaking about the attack years later, Lewis explained,  It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious. Lewis was also beaten by Alabama State Troopers on Bloody Sunday as civil rights marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. His skull was fractured after he and others were hit with night sticks.For his role in the civil rights struggle, Rep. Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2011.Featured image via The White House",News,"January 24, 2016",0,2484
 Trump Just Made His 2 Most DUNDERHEADED Moves Yet After Firing Comey (DETAILS),"As if firing FBI Director James Comey wasn t stupid enough, Trump has gone and driven two more nails into his own coffin this evening. First, he hired an outside law firm to send a certified letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that heard testimony from James Clapper and Sally Yates on May 8, regarding the Russia probe.Second, he s meeting with Vladimir Putin s top diplomat to the U.S., Sergey Lavrov, in the White House Wednesday morning. The Associated Press says that this could be a signal that our relationship with Russia is improving again, but in the wake of the clusterfuck that was Trump s entire Tuesday, this does not look good at all.First, the law firm and the letter. Trump wants the letter to Sen. Graham to claim that he has no connections to Russia.Seriously.He s hired an outside law firm to draft and send a letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham claiming that he has no connections business or otherwise to Russia. Because obviously.But wait! This move achieves the impossible by getting even more ridiculous than that! Sean Spicer briefed the White House press corps on this development, and said: The president, obviously, was aware of Senator Graham s suggestion after he made it today and he s fine with that. He has no business in Russia. He has no connections to Russia. So he welcomes that.In fact, he is already charged a leading law firm in Washington, D.C., to send a certified letter to Senator Graham to that point that he has no connections to Russia. If he knows he s got no connections at all to Russia, and he knows he s completely innocent of all these allegations, then why hire an outside law firm to send a letter to Sen. Graham reiterating that? That s not what someone who s sure of their innocence does.Now, his meeting with Lavrov is taking place after Lavrov meets with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Both meetings will supposedly focus on stabilizing Syria   the Trump administration seems to think that we need to work with Russia to accomplish anything there. But, as the AP notes in their story: [T]he meeting will be impossible to separate from the Trump administration s unfolding political drama in Washington, where FBI and congressional investigations are looking into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Kremlin related to last year s presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies accuse Moscow of meddling to help Trump s chances of victory. That, combined with this letter he s sending to Sen. Graham (and we have to wonder exactly how such a letter is going to prove that he s got no connections to Russia at all), just looks really, really bad. In fact, it s starting to look like the world is about to come crashing down around him.Featured image by Olivier Douliery   Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017",0,2885
"3,000 form chain of light against far right in Austrian government","VIENNA (Reuters) - At least 3,000 people formed a chain of light in Vienna on Wednesday to protest against the formation of a government that includes the far-right Freedom Party. Demonstrators holding flickering candles, torches and  bicycle lamps encircled the capital s government district.      Our republic s most powerful political offices should be exclusively reserved for trustworthy people who are not in the slightest connected to right-wing extremists,  said Alexander Pollak, spokesman for SOS Mitmensch, one of several human rights groups which organized the demonstration.  It was the biggest protest in Austria since coalition talks between the conservative People s Party (OVP) and the Freedom Party (FPO) started two weeks ago. Organizers estimated the number of people taking part at 8,000 to 10,000, the police at around 3,000.  We are here because they (the FPO) feed hatred and want to divide people,  said Brigitte Griesser, holding a candle.      But the protest was far smaller than unrest 17 years ago, when the FPO last formed a government with the OVP and more than 100,000 took to the streets.  (The shift to the right) has become a European trend... it s no longer just an Austrian issue and that s why it is not that controversial any longer,  said protester Juergen Pucher.

Queensland result leaves Australian PM closer to edge,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The loss of a state election in Queensland has stepped up pressure on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who risks losing control of parliament at a by-election next month. Three Australian prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010, and a splintering of the conservative base in Queensland has raised questions over how long Turnbull s premiership can survive. Opinion polls already show his popularity at a record low.  Queensland s Liberal National Party (LNP), which replicates the federal coalition made up of Turnbull s Liberal Party and its partner the National Party, was hurt by voters, particularly in regional and rural areas, defecting to Pauline Hanson s right-wing, populist One Nation party. Vote counting is still underway, but the conservative divide has left the Labor Party on track to form the government in the coal-rich northeastern state. Smarting from this latest setback, Turnbull reminded voters on Monday that if they backed One Nation at the next federal election it could play into the hands of the center opposition.  Everyone is entitled to cast their vote as they see fit but the voting for One Nation in the Queensland election has only assisted the Labor Party,   Turnbull told reporters in the city of Wollongong, south of Sydney. The next federal election is due either in late 2018 or early 2019. But first up is the Bennelong by-election on Dec. 16. Should the Liberals lose the seat in Sydney s north, Turnbull would have to negotiate with independents and small parties to retain control of the House of Representatives, where the government is formed. It could heighten chances of deadlock between the two houses of parliament, which might force Turnbull to call an early election, just as he did last year. Regarded as a moderate, Turnbull has trouble holding on to voters leaking to the right following the resurgence of Hanson s  anti-immigration party, according to Queensland University of Technology political science expert Clive Bean.  In recent times Queensland has often been one of the states that has made the difference when it comes to whether the coalition wins government or not,  said Bean.  The seats that tend to bleed votes to One Nation do tend to be seats where the LNP is traditionally stronger.  Forecast to win just one seat in Queensland, One Nation polled almost 14 percent of the vote, spoiling the LNP s chances of taking the state off Labor. At the federal level, the ruling coalition s fragility has been exacerbated by rules forcing lawmakers holding dual nationality, which is prohibited, to recontest seats. Bennelong is one such seat, and should defeat there lead to the coalition losing control over the House of Representatives it would immediately undermine the prime minister s efforts to  stave off an inquiry into Australia s scandal-hit major banks. While Turnbull has distanced himself from the Queensland election result, maverick coalition member George Christensen tweeted an apology to voters who switched allegiance to One Nation, blaming the federal government for not standing up for conservative values.  A lot of that rests with the Turnbull govt, it s (sic) leadership & policy direction,  the tweet said. ",worldnews,"November 27, 2017 ",1,3303

Pro-Palestinian march in Paris ahead of Netanyahu visit,"PARIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists on Saturday staged a protest in Paris against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s planned visit to France on Sunday.  Protestors carried Palestinian flags and photos of French President Emmanuel Macron marked  accomplice  for hosting Netanyahu following the U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Netanyahu, who has welcomed Trump s move, will meet with Macron on Sunday ahead of a meeting with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.  France said on Friday the United States had sidelined itself in the Middle East by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on French TV that the U.S. move went  against international law .   Trump says he has a project. Let him present it, so that this intervention can be wiped out by the restart of the peace process,  he said. Macron and Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan will work together to try to persuade the United States to reconsider the decision, a Turkish presidential source said on Saturday. France has been a supporter of the Palestinian cause. In 2014, the French National Assembly passed a non-binding motion calling on the government to recognize Palestine, but the government has not officially done so.

Tucker Carlson to Border Angels Founder: Why Shouldn’t Borders Be Protected?,"21st Century Wire says Why shouldn t borders be protected?  It is a fair question Tucker is asking Enrique Morones, founder of  Border Angels  (pro-immigration advocate group) in a recent discussion about President Trump s 10 point immigration plan.Morones was quick to call Trump s position on illegal immigration  racist  and  xenophobic  yet seemed to have no knowledge that the policies of Mexico are much more harsh with regard to illegal immigration. In Mexico illegal immigration is a felony, illegal immigrants can face deportations (based even on financial viability, physical and mental health) and up to 10 years in prison for repeat offenders. Tucker also points out that Mexico only allows 4% of their applicants clemency whereas the US grants 49% and Morones again seems completely unaware of the facts being presented.Certainly it is a sensitive topic that should be open for debate by all citizens but the critical thinkers out there are likely wondering  Are Morones and many of those on the left confusing the difference between enforcing legal US immigration policies and acts of hatred? Why does he not hold Mexico to the same standard as the US?

 GQ Magazine: Obama Is One Of The Greatest Presidents Of Our Time,"Like Rolling Stone before them, GQ Magazine is hailing President Obama as one of the greatest presidents of our time. Calling him  20 dollar bill  great and  Mount Rushmore  great, GQ s Jim Nelson puts it plainly:Something is dawning on us it s almost too soon for us to admit, but it s there, a half-considered thought only now blooming in our brains. Maybe we dismiss it with one of those quick cognitive fly swats. Nah, too early to say or I hate that guy. But the truth is coming, and it sounds like this: Barack Obama will be inducted into the league of Great Presidents.In fact, Nelson is so confident that President Obama will be remembered as one of greatest presidents, that he predicts, in due time, Obama will overtake Clinton as the best one since FDR.Now that s a lot of confidence. But how can Nelson be certain of such a grand prediction? It s really, really simple: he got stuff done. He helped save the world and United States  economy, he signed into law Obamacare, his character was paramount in the face of unprecedented obstruction, and yes, he is the first black president. But there was one special, electrifying quality that President Obama gave us that the best of best have given us: his speeches. His ability to communicate and relate to the average American was unlike any other:With Obama, each thoughtful step of the way, from his soaring acceptance speech ( The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep ) to his epic speeches on race and religion, his responses to the shootings in Tucson and Newtown, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the opening of Cuba ( Todos somos Americanos! ),and countless other momentous occasions, he knew how to speak to our better angels at a time when it was hard to locate any angels.With his mesmerizing clout, President Obama was able to do what other before him   like LBJ, Clinton and FDR   did, and that was get things done. In an era when  getting things done  is a thing too often out of reach, President Obama overcame the odds.I agree completely with GQ   President Obama is one of the nation s finest presidents, and history will be very kind to him.

Colombian president says he left firm listed in leaked tax haven papers,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, in response to his name appearing in a trove of leaked documents about offshore investments, said he left a company registered in tax haven Barbados before taking a ministerial post with a previous government. The so-called Paradise Papers published on Sunday showed the investments of wealthy people and institutions ranging from United States Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to Britain s Queen Elizabeth. Reuters has not independently verified the documents. Santos was listed in the leaked documents as a board member of insurance company Nova Holding in April and May 2000 and also Global Tuition, an insurance firm focused on education, from April 1999 to May 2001. Santos said in a statement on Sunday that he left Global Tuition before taking up his duties as Finance Minister in the government of then-President Andres Pastrana in August 2000. He said he was not a partner, did not invest any money and was not paid for serving on the board.  I imagine they delayed in officially registering the changes,  Santos said in answers given to El Espectador newspaper and released by his office.  I participated until before I became Finance Minister.  Santos said that after 2000 he was a Global Tuition client  for some of their insurance for the education of my three children.   Global Tuition s office was closed in Colombia for a public holiday on Monday and could not be reached for comment. The company s office in the United States said any comment would come from the Colombia office. The president s statement did not mention the other company,  Nova Holding. Nova Holding could not immediately be reached for comment. The documents were obtained by Germany s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets, including El Espectador and Connectas website in Colombia.

U.S. Transportation nominee Chao hits no roadblocks in confirmation hearing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s choice to run the U.S. Transportation Department, Elaine Chao, defended the president-elect’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan as a “bold vision” on Wednesday in an overwhelmingly friendly Senate confirmation hearing. While there is criticism of Chao, in particular on environmental issues, there is no significant opposition to her nomination and she is expected to be confirmed.  She served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 and was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She was deputy secretary of transportation under President George H. W. Bush. She was introduced by her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The top-ranking Democrat on the committee, Florida’s Bill Nelson, noted his wife’s friendship with Chao. Chao will take a leading role in Trump’s plans to rebuild crumbling U.S. roads and bridges with a $1 trillion fund. He would offer private investors who put money into projects an 82 percent tax credit but critics say it is unclear how they could recoup investments in most projects without sharply increasing costs for users of most roads and bridges. Chao described the plan to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation as a “bold vision” and acknowledged the need to work on the issue of paying investors back. “For them (partnerships) to be truly effective, there need to be revenue streams that need to be assured,” she added. “We all know that the government doesn’t have the resources to do it all.”  Chao is nominated to head a department with such wide-ranging responsibilities as oversight of the nation’s airports and highways, fuel-economy rules for autos and probes into auto makers for safety recalls of key parts like airbags.  She declined to take positions on issues like whether the job of air traffic control should be privatized, concerns over the safety of shipments of crude oil by rail, foreign airlines like Norwegian Air Shuttle’s push to move into the U.S. market and regulation of developing technology like autonomous vehicles and drones. Chao faced no questions about her memberships on corporate boards. Chao is on the board of Wells Fargo & Co which has struggled since September after it agreed with regulators to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle charges that its employees wrongly created as many as 2 million accounts without customer authorization. Chao is an immigrant from Taiwan who arrived in the United States at age 8. Her father, James S.C. Chao, is founder of the Foremost Group, an international shipping company.

HOLY FREEDOM OF SPEECH! Obama’s Attorney General Promises To Punish Americans For Anti-Muslim Speech…UPDATE: Why Lynch May Be “Most Likely Candidate” To Quickly Push Through Supreme Court Justice Nomination Process,"UPDATE: A leading Supreme Court analyst thinks Attorney General Loretta Lynch is the  most likely candidate  to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.Tom Goldstein, who runs the influential SCOTUSblog, had earlier predicted Ninth Circuit Judge Paul Watford would make the top of President Obama s shortlist. But in a revised blog post, Goldstein said he now believes Lynch is the leading contender.Lynch is a  very serious possibility,  Goldstein wrote.  The fact that Lynch was vetted so recently for attorney general also makes it practical for the president to nominate her in relatively short order.  Via: NBC NewsSocial media users beware! You ve been warned by Obama s henchwoman, Attorney General Loretta Lynch The day after a horrific shooting spree by a  radicalized  Muslim man and his partner in San Bernardino, California, Attorney General Loretta Lynch pledged to a group of Muslim activists that she would take aggressive action against anyone who used  anti-Muslim rhetoric  that  edges toward violence. Speaking to the audience at the Muslim Advocate s 10th anniversary dinner Thursday, Lynch said her  greatest fear  is the  incredibly disturbing rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric  in America and vowed to prosecute any guilty of what she deemed violence-inspiring speech. She said:The fear that you have just mentioned is in fact my greatest fear as a prosecutor, as someone who is sworn to the protection of all of the American people, which is that the rhetoric will be accompanied by acts of violence. My message to not just the Muslim community but to the entire American community is: we cannot give in to the fear that these backlashes are really based on.Assuring the pro-Muslim group that  we stand with you,  Lynch said she would use her Justice Department to protect Muslims from  violence  and discrimination.Claiming that violence against Muslims is on the rise and citing France s clamp down on potentially radicalized mosques, Lynch suggested the Constitution does not protect  actions predicated on violent talk  and pledged to prosecute those responsible for such actions. When we talk about the First Amendment we [must] make it clear that actions predicated on violent talk are not American,  said Lynch.  They are not who we are, they are not what we do, and they will be prosecuted. My message not just to the Muslim community but to all Americans is  We cannot give in to the fear that these backlashes are really based on,'  said Lynch.It is painfully clear that, like her predecessor Eric Holder, Lynch is far more concerned with promoting the social justice agenda than protecting the Constitutional rights of American citizens. What exactly is speech that  edges toward violence ? What exactly are  actions predicated on violent talk ? In the end, it is whatever she decides it to mean.

Then Be Prepared To Vote For Trump’s Health Care Bill,"By now we re all familiar with Donald Trump s speech in front of 40,000 boy scouts at their National Jamboree last month, when the President rambled like a drunken stepfather, straying from the usual topics of diplomacy and citizenship and turning an 80-year presidential tradition into a campaign rally before a crowd of adolescents. But the madness didn t stop there.According to reports, White House aides told Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, host state of this year s quadrennial Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree, that she could fly with him on Air Force One when he addressed the boy scouts, but only on one condition; that she vote in favor of Senate Republicans  healthcare bill. At the time the offer was made to Capito, Republicans were clutching at straws and doing anything possible to salvage their overhaul in the Senate in an effort to actually try and come through on one of the main promises Donald Trump made the entire time he was on the campaign trail, to repeal and replace  the disaster that is Obamacare. Naturally, Capito took the high road and turned down the offer, mainly due to the fact that she hadn t even read the actual text of the bill at the time, however, Capito was also one of several Republicans senators who had made their doubts clear about it in the first place.There were several versions of the plan that failed so the Republicans ultimately threw together a  skinny repeal,  but that also failed when 49 voted for it while 51 voted against, with Arizona Senator John McCain casting the deciding negative vote. Capito also voted against the Republican s skinny repeal, sending them back to the drawing board.President Trump still vows to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and is adamant that he will get his bill passed, however, it may take a little more than a ride on Air Force One to get the votes.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2017",0,2026
RED ALERT: CLINTON DESTROYED EVIDENCE IN TWO WAYS…Isn’t This Criminal Intent?, ,Government News,"Sep 2, 2016",0,78
Obama administration seeks to curb methane emissions on public land,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In its latest move to combat climate change, the Obama administration on Friday said it will overhaul 30-year-old regulations for oil and gas operations on public and tribal lands to limit the “wasteful release” of natural gas and curb methane emissions.  The proposal by the Interior department’s Bureau of Land Management would require oil and gas producers to use currently available technology to limit flaring at oil wells on federal land. It would also require operators to regularly check for natural gas leaks and replace outdated equipment that allows large quantities of gas and methane to escape into the air.  The overhaul would also clarify when oil and gas companies need to pay royalties on flared natural gas.   “These updated regulations, which would be phased in over several years ... would not only get more of our nation’s natural gas into pipelines and delivered to market but also reduce pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change,” Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Janice Schneider said.  The proposal comes as a major methane leak from a natural gas storage site near Los Angeles has forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes for months and put a spotlight on emissions oversight. The BLM overhaul would only affect federal land. The overhaul would reduce flaring by up 60 percent and venting by up to 46 percent compared to 2013 rates. The BLM estimates that it would prevent the loss of up to 56 billion cubic feet of gas a year through venting, flaring or leaks, which could supply around 760,000 households annually.  The agency said it would also avoid methane emissions that would be equivalent to up to 4.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.  Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Though it only lasts in the atmosphere for 20 years, methane is 84 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat, and environmental groups have pressed the administration for tighter restrictions on leaks. Energy industry groups and some Republican lawmakers blasted the rule, announced as Washington prepares for a major blizzard, arguing that it deprives states of needed revenue and duplicates voluntary efforts by companies to reduce waste.   “Another duplicative rule at a time when methane emissions are already falling and on top of an onslaught of other new BLM and EPA regulations could drive more energy production off federal lands,” said Erik Milito, director of upstream and industry operations at the American Petroleum Institute. The overhaul forms part of the broader Obama administration strategy announced last January to reduce oil and gas sector methane emissions by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The strategy includes an Environmental Protection Agency proposal announced in August targeting methane emissions from new or modified oil and gas processing and transmission facilities and wells. It comes on the heels of a BLM announcement last week that it will freeze new leases for coal production on public land. ",politicsNews,"January 22, 2016 ",1,3191
 CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Trump Supporter Goes RABID Against Hillary Supporters On Flight (VIDEO),"There definitely seems to be a new sense of entitlement among Donald Trump supporters now that he won the Electoral College count in the presidential election. They can t exactly say he won via popular support seeing as Hillary Clinton currently leads by over 2 million votes.However, these Trump supporting bullies are out there nonetheless, with seemingly a permission slip from the new bully-in-chief-elect, to be as awful to others as they want to be. After all, Trump was a bully to pretty much everyone and still won the election.One of the most recent examples of this bullying behavior was caught on camera.While boarding a plane, one Trump supporter was outright being plane vile to anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton. Even shouting: We got some Hillary bitches on here?! Then proceeds to say: Donald Trump! He s y alls president. Every god damn one of yas. If you don t like it, too bad. Regardless of the bad grammar or the obvious observation that he may very well be intoxicated, this sort of entitled bully behavior has been seen all over the country.What is even more startling, is that people seem to be allowing it and staying silent as he rants.We have to speak up or people like this will continue to think it s okay. This man should ve been tossed from the plane, but he wasn t. This isn t okay.Watch this Trump supporter be exactly like the bully we also know his leader to be: The epitome of post-election white privilege.

RUSSIA Mocks Sore Loser Obama For Trying To Destroy U.S.-Russian Relations Before Trump Takes Office [VIDEO],"President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday  it s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things  after the Obama administration issued sanctions against Russia for its alleged 2016 election hacking. It s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,  Trump said in a written response released four hours after the announcement.  Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation. The Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia s intelligence services, while ejecting dozens of intelligence operatives from the U.S. as part of a response to what it says are efforts by Moscow to influence the election.Using an executive order, President Obama sanctioned the GRU and the FSB   two of Russia s intelligence services as well as other entities and individuals associated with the GRU. The cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate the hack of its emails earlier this year concluded the hacking came from the Fancy Bear group, believed to be affiliated with the GRU, Russia s military intelligence agency.In addition to the sanctions, the State Department has declared 35 Russian intelligence operatives  persona non grata  in the U.S., giving them 72 hours to leave, and is shutting down two Russian compounds in Maryland and New York.Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman said in response to the announcement that Moscow will consider retaliatory measures. We think that such steps by a U.S. administration that has three weeks left to work are aimed at two things: to further harm Russian-American ties, which are at a low point as it is, as well as, obviously, to deal a blow to the foreign policy plans of the incoming administration of the president-elect,  Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.The Russian Embassy in the UK took a different approach, tweeting out a picture of a lame duck and blasting what it called  Cold War deja vu. President Obama expels 35   diplomats in Cold War deja vu. As everybody, incl   people, will be glad to see the last of this hapless Adm. pic.twitter.com/mleqA16H8D  Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) December 29, 2016The Treasury Secretary meanwhile has named two individuals   Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev and Aleksey Alekseyevich Belan   it says were involved in  malicious cyber-enabled activities. These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior,  Obama said in a statement.Obama also announced that the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI will release declassified information on Russian cyberactivity to help  identify, detect and Russia s global campaign of malicious cyber activities. Obama also said that the administration will be providing a report to Congress  in the coming days  about Russian attempts to interfere in the election, as well as previous election cycles.The president also hinted that his administration intends to do more to hold Russia accountable. These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia s aggressive activities,  Obama said.  We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized. U.S. intelligence services have concluded that the Russians interfered in the election to try and help President-elect Donald Trump win. Trump has dismissed the conclusions. Russia does not share America s interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today s action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia,  Ryan said.Incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schemer, D-NY., also praised the move in a statement late Thursday.

" Trump And His ‘Street Fighters’ Prepare To Wage War On Leaks, Investigations (DETAILS)","Donald Trump has become increasingly paranoid and frustrated as the investigation into ties between his 2016 presidential campaign, his outside associates, and perhaps even himself and the Russian government heats up. There have already been two rounds of subpoenas issued to Trump s disgraced National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, regarding this matter. Further, it doesn t help that Trump s own White House is leaking like a sieve to the New York Times and the Washington Post regarding the chaos within   especially when it comes to the handling of the Russia matter. Things are so worrisome at this point that Trump has already hired outside lawyers to represent him. So, how is Team Trump planning to handle all the scandal that continues to plague their White House? Why, they are going to wage war on investigators and leakers   for years, if necessary.Axios is reporting that Trump will have his  street fighters  devise a plan to target leaks from within the intelligence community and other parts of the government with zeal, and they also have come to realize that the Russia investigation is not going away just because they want it to. They cannot fire or lie their way out of this one, and the press isn t going to let go of a story this big. According to a Trump-backer, they are ready for this fight: The White House is embracing the fight, which is going to last as long as Donald Trump is president. We re getting street fighters ready to go. Axios has also obtained a detailed a  war room  plan regarding this escalating war between the White House and the rest of the government:The thing is, though, that the Trump White House can t even function on a day to day basis. They aren t even staffed up like a normal White House would be by now. The same goes for other major administration agencies, such as the State Department. Further, the chaos inside barely allows the staffers to get anything at all done other than try to control Trump s television time, feed him positive news so that he doesn t go off the rails too often, and to control his tweeting   which they seem to be failing miserable at.The idea that these incompetent wannabe authoritarians are any match for the apparatus of the United States government is downright laughable. Likely, we ll just get even more self-incrimination and meme-worthy buffoonery out of this plan.Good luck, Trump staffers.

Four U.S. lawmakers urge safety agency to address vehicle hacking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four Republican members of Congress on Monday urged U.S. auto safety regulators to convene an industry-wide effort to prevent possible attacks on computer systems in vehicles. The lawmakers addressed their concerns in a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. While there have been no reported cases of vehicle hacking, researchers have shown they could take remote control of vehicle functions such as car horns, brakes and power steering. The letter cited work published in August by Wired magazine by two researchers who were able to force a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV 2014 Jeep SUV to perform in an “erratic and unsafe manner” after accessing its on-board diagnostics (OBD) port. Automakers have been required to install the port in all vehicles since 1994 to test for emissions compliance. The letter from Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and three others said the port “as it currently exists creates a growing risk to the safety and security of passengers.” Fiat Chrysler said in August the demonstration published by Wired required “a computer to be physically connected into the vehicle’s” port. The company emphasized that owners should “not connect any unknown or untrusted devices to the OBD port.” NHTSA didn’t immediately comment on the letter. The safety agency has said it plans to release cybersecurity guidelines to the auto industry in the coming weeks. The U.S. government is taking the issue seriously. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said it has formed a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other internet-connected tools. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and NHTSA issued a bulletin in March warning that motor vehicles were “increasingly vulnerable” to hacking. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",1,1962

" Trump Whines About The Size Of His Inauguration Crowd, Threatens Media For Reporting Accurate Numbers","Rather than do the damn job he swore to do, Donald Trump is now obsessed with complaining about media estimates of his inauguration crowd size.Trump had predicted that his inauguration would draw a record-breaking crowd. To break the record, which is held by President Obama in 2008, Trump would have had to get over 1.8 million people to show up.But he didn t even get half a million as aerial photographs and reports from the DC Metro show that Trump s audience left a hell of a lot of empty space in the National Mall.During a visit to the CIA, Trump complained about the media reports and claimed that his crowd numbered at least 1.5 million. We had a massive field of people. You saw that. Packed,  Trump claimed.  I get up this morning and I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I said,  Wait a minute, I made a speech.  I looked out. The field was it looked like a million, a million and a half people,  Trump said.  They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. They said,  Donald Trump did not draw well.  It looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument and I turn on, by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. Said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that s not bad. But it s a lie. We had 250,000 people in the little ball that we constructed. Trump then insisted that the entire National Mall was packed all the way to the Washington Monument and then warned the media that they will  pay a price  for accurately reporting the numbers.Here s the video via Twitter:President Trump on crowd size at inauguration:  It looked like a million and a half people.  https://t.co/U5pWhBBMzt https://t.co/NX6vI6UTHR  CNN (@CNN) January 21, 2017Yes, up near the Capitol where Trump spoke was clearly packed, but the National Mall definitely was not.In fact, we can compare Trump s inauguration attendance to President Obama s in 2009 with photographs taken at the same time just before the inaugural address was delivered.For those saying  Trump can t be that hated, look at the size of the crowd    #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/Sczp6Feta5  Stefan Kay (@5tefanK) January 20, 2017What is shown is that President Obama s crowd reaches all the way to the Washington Monument in the photo on the left, while Trump s crowd is, indeed, sparse and does NOT reach the Washington Monument as he claims.Apparently, Trump is thinking of President Obama s inauguration crowd instead of his own.And the DC Metro statistics corroborate the photos.Metro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today.

Myanmar military appoints general to probe mass grave in Rakhine state,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s army said on Wednesday that it had appointed a senior officer to investigate whether any members of the security forces were involved in the killing of 10 people whose bodies have been uncovered in a mass grave in Rakhine State. A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the western state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months. The discover of the grave, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, was announced by the military two days ago. In a statement posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said a five-member investigation team had left the capital Naypyitaw on Wednesday. The team, led by Lieutenant General Aye Win, would  investigate whether the security forces took part or not, in relation to the unidentified dead bodies found in Inn Din village graveyard . It gave no further details and military officials were not immediately available for comment. General Aye Win is the same officer who led a wider probe into the conduct of troops in a conflict that began in late August, which concluded in a report last month that no atrocities took place. Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25. Rights monitors have accused troops of abuses, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya. The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",1,2111
Congressman seeks probe of chartered flights by U.S. energy secretary,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. congressman is asking the Department of Energy’s watchdog to investigate Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s travel on chartered aircraft, the congressman said at a hearing on Thursday. U.S. Representative Frank Pallone said Perry’s trips on chartered planes need scrutiny in light of the “extreme” budget cuts the department faces in a 2018 federal budget proposed by Republican President Donald Trump.  In a letter on Thursday to the Energy Department’s inspector general, Pallone cited a $35,000 trip Perry took from Washington to a private airport in Kansas that was within a 45-minute drive of Kansas City International Airport. “It is unclear why Secretary Perry would require such costly travel in instances where more economical options were readily available,” Pallone wrote. Perry said in his opening statement to the U.S. House of Representatives’ Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy hearing, that as a former Texas governor he understood the issue of travel oversight and the need to spend money on travel appropriately and thoughtfully. “I travel a lot to do my job. I do it in a way that I think is thoughtful,” he said. Perry’s charter flights have cost taxpayers more than $56,000, according to records the Energy Department released to Reuters on Friday. One of those flights - from a coal mine in Pennsylvania to a nuclear facility in Ohio - occurred just a day before former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned and promised to repay the government for some $52,000 worth of travel including private flights. Perry said on Thursday it would have been “very difficult” to take a commercial flight from the Pennsylvania site to the Ohio plant. Pallone’s letter, which Democratic Representatives Diana DeGette and Bobby Rush also signed, asked the inspector general to determine whether there was a “mechanism for Secretary Perry to reimburse taxpayers” for the flights if they failed to meet ethical and procedural criteria for government travel.  A spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office said the office had received the letter and the inspector-general was reviewing its contents.  Inspectors general for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Interior Department have opened similar investigations into charter travel by Trump’s EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.

Senate leaders look to work with White House to block Moore,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he wanted to work with the White House to explore ways to keep embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore from taking office if he wins a special election in Alabama. Speaking to reporters at the U.S. Capitol, McConnell said he had been in contact with President Donald Trump and others about sexual misconduct allegations against Moore. “He’s obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate,” McConnell said, “and we’ve looked at all the options to try and prevent that from happening.” Five women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct stemming from when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. Moore, now 70, has denied the allegations.  Trump returns to Washington on Tuesday evening from a 12-day trip to Asia, and McConnell said he planned to discuss Moore’s situation with the president. Both are Republicans.  McConnell said he had also spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly about Moore. Trump supported Moore’s opponent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary but threw his support to Moore after Strange was defeated. McConnell said Republicans were still considering having a candidate launch a write-in campaign against Moore for the Dec. 12 special election. Speculation has centered on Strange and the current U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as possibilities. McConnell said later in the day that Sessions, who left the Senate seat to become attorney general, would be a plausible write-in candidate. “He fits the mold of somebody who might be able to pull off a write-in,” the majority leader said during a forum on the economy.  Before the allegations surfaced, Moore, a Christian conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice,  had been heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate. Under state law, Moore cannot be removed from the ballot. “Obviously this close to the election, it’s a very complicated matter,” McConnell said earlier. Moore has suggested that McConnell and other establishment Republicans were working in tandem with news media to discredit him.  After McConnell’s remarks, Moore responded by tweeting: “The good people of Alabama, not the Washington elite who wallow in the swamp, will decide this election!” McConnell urged Moore on Monday to leave the race, while Senator Cory Gardner, who chairs the Republican Party’s Senate campaign arm, suggested the Senate should expel Moore should he continue campaigning and win.  The Republican National Committee has withdrawn its support for Moore, according to a Federal Election Commission filing on Tuesday, after the party’s Senate campaign wing, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, ended a fundraising deal with him on Friday.  In Birmingham, Alabama, Jones told reporters his campaign had no plans to directly attack Moore over the allegations in a bid to capitalize on the furor. “We’re going to stay in our lane. We’re going to talk about the issues that we continue to talk about,” he said. “We will bring up his record, his previous record, other people will bring up the issues of the day. And people will have a choice.” Jones’ campaign released a new ad on Tuesday featuring Republican voters who say they are backing the Democrat. “I’m a Republican, but Roy Moore - no way,” one voter says in the ad. The national Democratic Party, however, has yet to invest directly in the race beyond funds to build the state party, and has not changed that stance since the Moore allegations surfaced. Earlier in the day, Sessions said in testimony before Congress that he had no reason to doubt the five women who have accused Moore of misconduct when they were in their teens. The House of Representatives’ top Republican, Speaker Paul Ryan, said he believed Moore’s accusers and that Moore should leave the race.  “If he cares about the values and people he claims to care about, then he should step aside,” Ryan told a news conference. On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson became the fifth woman to accuse Moore of misconduct, saying he sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore said on Monday that Nelson’s accusations were “absolutely false.” Moore has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations and accusations.  ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2017 ",1,4862
Democrats protest Senate Republican healthcare secrecy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats took to the Senate floor on Monday to throw a spotlight on behind-the-scenes efforts by the Republican majority to repeal former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, known as Obamacare. In a series of floor motions, inquiries and lengthy speeches, Democrats criticized the closed-door meetings that Republicans have been holding to craft a replacement for Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. They called for open committee hearings and more time to consider the bill before a Senate vote, which Republicans say could come in the next two weeks, although a draft bill has yet to emerge publicly. Lacking the votes to derail or change the Republican process, the maneuvers by the Democratic minority seemed more aimed at highlighting Republican efforts on a controversial issue. Polls have said that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Obamacare replacement that has passed the House of Representatives and that Senate Republicans are now considering. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that the closed-door Republican meetings on healthcare amounted to “the most glaring departure from normal legislative procedure that I have ever seen.”  “Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,” Schumer charged. The resulting legislation would likely throw millions out of health insurance, he said, while granting “a big fat tax break for the wealthiest among us.” Senators are not obligated to hold meetings in the open, but Democrats pointed out that there were lengthy committee meetings and many days of floor debate on Obamacare before it passed in 2010. Several Democrats moved for the healthcare legislation to be referred to Senate committees for hearings, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused. McConnell said all Republican senators have been involved to some degree in healthcare meetings and that Democrats would have a chance to amend the legislation they produce, once it is brought to the Senate floor. “We’re going to have a meeting on the Senate floor, all hundred of us, with an unlimited amendment process,” McConnell said. “So there will be no failure of opportunity.” Senate Republican leaders would like a vote on healthcare legislation in July, before the July 4 recess if possible. But Republicans have struggled to coalesce around a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions. Senate Republicans also face pressure from the right.

The pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by former President Barack Obama, who said the pipeline would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming. Trump signed an executive order to advance the project soon after taking office in January, saying it would create thousands of jobs. The administration official said that among those scheduled to be at the White House for the 10:15 a.m. EDT announcement are TransCanada Chief Executive Russell Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions. Expedited approval of projects is part of Trump’s approach for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through the maze of regulatory requirements. “It does fit into the overall strategy the president has for infrastructure,” the official said. The multibillion-dollar Keystone pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canada’s oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico.  Approvals are still needed from state regulators, and the pipeline could face legal challenges. Conservatives have said they support quick approval. Nick Loris, an energy and environment researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday that approval would “re-establish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering.” Environmental groups that have opposed the pipeline have said they will continue the fight with petitions, political pressure and mass protests.

"Islamic State's Baghdadi, in undated audio, urges militants to keep fighting","CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi has exhorted followers across the world to wage attacks against the West and to keep fighting in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. The message released on Thursday was his first purported audio communication in almost a year during which his jihadist group lost much of its self-proclaimed  caliphate . The audio, partly dedicated to religious scriptures, came after several reports Baghdadi had been killed. His last recording was in November 2016, two weeks after the start of the  battle to recapture the city of Mosul from Islamic State (IS).  Oh Soldiers of the Caliphate, fan the flames of war on your enemies, take it to them and besiege them in every corner, and stand fast and courageous.   Beware of retreat, or the feeling of defeat, beware of negotiations or surrender. Do not lay down your arms,  Baghdadi said, referring to followers in Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, North Africa and elsewhere in Africa. The date of the 46-minute recording, released via the Al-Furqan news organization, was not clear. But in it, Baghdadi makes an apparent reference to recent events including North Korean threats against Japan and United States and the recapture two months ago of Mosul by U.S.-backed Iraqi forces. Since Baghdadi proclaimed the caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria in 2014, Iraqi forces have retaken a string of cities in western and northern Iraq including Mosul, where Baghdadi made his announcement from the city s El Nuri mosque. Western-backed Syrian forces are also thrusting into the eastern Syrian city of Raqqa, Islamic State s operational headquarters from where it plotted many of the attacks that have killed hundreds of people around the world. Baghdadi also called for attacks on Western media, saying:  Oh soldiers of Islam in every location, increase blow after  blow, and make the media centers of the infidels, from where they wage their intellectual wars, among the targets.   Continue your Jihad and your blessed operations and do not let the crusaders rest in their homes and enjoy life and stability while your brethren are being shelled and killed.  The fall of Mosul in July effectively marked the end of the Iraqi half of Baghdadi s  caliphate  even though Islamic State continues to fight in some territory outside of Mosul, the largest city they came to control in both Iraq and Syria. An IS branch in Libya was also defeated last year in the city of Sirte, where they had set up a North African beachhead in 2014. In Egypt s northern Sinai, another affiliated militant group is still fighting Egyptian military forces.  With God s will and his strength, we are staying determined, patient...The abundance of killing will not stop us,  Baghdadi said in the audio recording.  Officials have said they believed it could take years to capture or kill Baghdadi as he is thought to be hiding in a vast swathe of sparsely-populated desert between Mosul and Raqqa, where attacking drones are easy to spot. The United States has offered a $25 million bounty for information that would locate Baghdadi. Russia s defense ministry said earlier this year it might have killed Baghdadi in an air strike on a gathering of IS commanders on the outskirts of Raqqa. But U.S. officials said they could not corroborate the death and other Western as well as Iraqi officials were skeptical. ",worldnews,"September 28, 2017 ",1,3448

Alphabet soup as Kazakh leader orders switch to Latin letters,"ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan is to change its official alphabet for the third time in less than 100 years in what is seen in part as symbolic move to underline its independence. President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered his office on Thursday to prepare for a switch to a Latin-based alphabet from a Cyrillic one, distancing itself, at least graphically, from Russia. The oil-rich former Soviet republic of 18 million has very close ties with Moscow, its main trading partner, but is also wary of Russia s ambitions to maintain its political influence throughout the region. Kazakh, a Turkic language, used to be written in Arabic script until the 1920s when the Soviet Union briefly introduced a Latin alphabet for it. This was later replaced by a Cyrillic one in 1940, based on the Russian alphabet. Part of the latest switch relates to modern technology. The currently used Cyrillic alphabet has 42 symbols, making it cumbersome to use with digital devices - a standard Kazakh keyboard utilizes almost all number keys in addition to letter and punctuation keys. The latest version of the proposed Latin alphabet works around that by using apostrophe signs to modify letters. The country s official name would thus be spelled as Qazaqstan Respy blikasy. According to a statement published by Nazarbayev s office, he has ordered his chief of staff to draft an executive order introducing the new alphabet. The switch will be gradual, it said. Alhough Kazakh has been the state language since Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, only 62 percent of the population said they were fluent in both written and spoken Kazakh during a the most recent national census in 2009. Russian is more widespread with 85 percent claiming fluency in the same census. Russian is recognized as an official language in Kazakhstan. Several other Turkic nations, including Turkey itself, ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, have also switched to Latin alphabets. ",worldnews,"October 26, 2017 ",1,2017
 Trump Sends Out Email Begging Supporters To Send Him Money To Defend Against His Scandals,"Minutes after news broke that Donald Trump had asked James Comey to drop his investigation into Michael Flynn   and that Comey had kept documentation of that meeting unbeknownst to Trump   Trump s never-ending campaign arm shot out an email asking his supporters to send him money. The grifting never stops.In the email, DonaldJTrump.com tells Trump s followers that there is a vast conspiracy against him by people who don t want him to  drain the swamp.  According to the tortured logic, these secret  special interest  groups conspired to destroy him by leaking the criminal and boneheaded things that he has been doing. And naturally, the  media  was also involved:You already knew the media was out to get us.But sadly it s not just the fake news  There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire America First movement.Steve Bannon was right when he said,  If you think they re going to give you your country back without a fight, you re sadly mistaken.

Just out from Trump campaign subject lined ""SABOTAGE"" pic.twitter.com/w7xy0L47oF  Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) May 16, 2017Trump s team promises that the next step is to  completely DRAIN THE SWAMP.  It s unclear how Trump plans to do that when his Secretary of State is an oil executive, half his staff comes from Goldman Sachs, and his own daughter has an office down the hall from the Oval Office.The wording in the email suggests that Trump and his band of followers are retreating even further into their own paranoid delusions. The leaks Trump is so concerned about have been independently confirmed time and again. Trump himself, in his own blustering way, often confirms reports about himself in fits of rage. In the most recent example, Trump took to Twitter to loudly acknowledge that he had given sensitive information to Russia despite his own staff saying it was  false  the night before.Left with few options, Trump is now declaring all out war on the truth. Any bad press is  fake news  and  deep state  malcontents trying to undermine him. The much more realistic idea that Trump himself is so completely incompetent that he brings these scandals on himself never occurs to him.Featured image by Michael Reynolds-Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 16, 2017",0,2707
EU heads toward tougher action on Poland after Merkel joins fray,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany s entry alongside France into a battle between the European Commission and Poland over the rule of law increases the likelihood of unprecedented EU action to punish Warsaw.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel abandoned her usual public restraint last week by criticizing Poland s governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, showing the European Union s executive has the firm backing of its most influential member. It may be a watershed moment in the dispute over an overhaul of the judiciary and other steps taken by PiS which Brussels says undermine democracy in the largest ex-communist EU state. Poland risks a reprimand under procedures known as Article 7 that have never been used before and would deal a heavy blow to its prestige, deepen its isolation in the bloc and diminish its ability to influence EU policies. Much is also at stake for the EU. The row has deepened divisions as the EU comes to terms with Brexit and failure to act against a member seen as flouting democracy could raise questions about its determination to defend its core values.  As much as I wish for good relations with Poland   they are our neighbor and I will always strive for this given the importance of our ties   we can t simply keep our mouth shut in order to keep the peace,  Merkel said in Berlin.   This goes to the very foundations of our cooperation within the European Union.   For a decade after it joined the EU in 2004, Poland was the  poster child of the bloc s eastward expansion as it was seen as faithfully upholding the EU s democratic values and its economy thrived. But relations have deteriorated rapidly since the eurosceptic PiS led by former prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, long a political foe of European Council President Donald Tusk, won power in late 2015.  The Commission opened an inquiry into the rule of law in Poland in January 2016 after new legislation put more power in the hands of the Warsaw government, a move seen in Brussels as weakening democratic checks and balances. The main battle now is over reforms that the Commission says undermine the judiciary s independence, giving the justice minister discretionary power to prolong the mandates of judges at retirement age and dismiss and appoint court presidents. In another unprecedented development, Warsaw has also ignored a ruling by the EU s top court by continuing with large-scale logging in an ancient forest. Until now Berlin has let French President Emmanuel Macron take the lead on Poland since he took office last May. He says Warsaw is isolating itself and shunned Poland and its close EU ally, Hungary, during a recent tour of eastern Europe. But Merkel, who will seek a fourth term as chancellor in an election on Sept. 24, showed her concern by speaking out against Poland last Tuesday and by discussing Poland last week with the head of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.  A diplomatic source said their talks included discussion of how quickly to proceed in the row with Warsaw. PiS denies accusations by the Commission, Western EU states, political opponents in Poland and rights groups that it is eroding democracy in the country of 38 million people.   Some EU politicians have made comments most recently that are unjust on Poland. That is why I want to stress that Poland is a democratic country, based on the rule of law,  Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said in video footage released last week. Filmed standing in front of Polish and EU flags, she said:  Let s not allow particular interests of particular countries to overshadow the chief current task, which is to guarantee security to the people of our continent.  The Commission has the option of triggering Article 7, which would mean asking all 27 other EU states to declare that PiS is putting democracy at risk.  But imposing sanctions would require unanimity among the other member states and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has made clear he would shield Warsaw from the maximum punishment   stripping it of its EU voting rights. Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans said last week he would propose opening Article 7 if Poland starts dismissing Supreme Court judges, adding:  We are very close to triggering Article 7.  But he also said Brussels was waiting to see what proposals Polish President Andrzej Duda makes on two judiciary laws, including on the Supreme Court, proposed by PiS after he vetoed them in July. Two others have been signed. His comments indicate Warsaw still has a last chance to escape Article 7. No formal decision is likely before the EU leaders meet for a Brussels summit in October at the earliest. One EU official said Article 7  is where this seems to be heading  but added:  Nobody likes to single out a member state like that. Everyone has their sins and this creates a dangerous precedent - what if you are going to be the next one?  ",worldnews,"September 4, 2017 ",1,4928
Macron enacts public ethics law with a whiff of U.S.-style razzmatazz,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron invited cameras into his Elysee Palace office on Friday as he signed into law new legislation, making him the first French president to wield his constitutional power in public view.

On Friday he was enacting legislation to tighten up ethical standards in French politics - one of his main election promises after a campaign race marred by financial scandal.  The law prohibits ministers, national lawmakers and locally elected officials from employing family members, prevents individuals with criminal records from seeking elected office, and refuses parliamentarians the right to hold advisory roles during their mandates. Government spokesman Christophe Castaner said Macron wanted a ceremony befitting of a  historic moment in the relationship between the French and their political class .

Wife of Chechen accused of Putin assassination plot shot dead near Kiev,"KIEV (Reuters) - The Ukrainian wife of a Chechen man accused by Russia of plotting to kill President Vladimir Putin was shot dead outside Kiev on Monday in an attack that also wounded her husband, Ukrainian interior ministry officials said. Amina Okuyeva and Adam Osmayev were in a car that was shot at from bushes near a railway crossing on the outskirts of the capital, interior ministry advisors Anton Gerashchenko and Zoryan Shkiryak said in separate posts on Facebook. The attack follows a vehicle bombing in Kiev last Thursday, in which two people were killed and three wounded, including Ihor Mosiychuk, a member of the populist opposition Radical Party. Okuyeva had links to Mosiychuk, having once worked for him in an advisory role.  As a result of the injuries she sustained, Amina died. Adam Osmayev was wounded, but will live. I just spoke to him on the telephone,  Gerashchenko said. The incident is the second attempt this year on the life of Osmayev, from Russia s mainly Muslim Chechnya region. In June, he survived an attack by a gunman, who was in turn shot and wounded by Okuyeva. Gerashchenko and Shkiryak did not suggest a motive for the latest incident.  Mosiychuk has blamed Russia for last week s bombing, while Ukrainian police have said Russian involvement is one of the possible motives being investigated. Russia has dismissed the accusations as a product of anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine.  Relations between Kiev and Moscow collapsed in 2014 after Russia seized Ukraine s Crimea peninsula and backed a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukrainian regions. Russian authorities accuse Osmayev of being part of a 2012 plot by Islamist rebels to kill Putin with a bomb in central Moscow. Osmayev and Okuyeva are well-known figures in Ukraine, having served as volunteers for the Ukrainian military in the fight against pro-Russian rebels. Moscow has fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya  since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The region is now broadly under the control of Moscow, but Chechens are known to have fought both for the pro-Russian rebels and for the Ukrainian army in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Since fighting broke out in the east in 2014, the number of incidents involving explosives outside the conflict zone has increased. There has been a spate of vehicle bombings over the past 18 months in Kiev, the capital, and elsewhere, but investigators have failed to find those responsible. ",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",1,2532

Factbox: Trump adviser from Wall Street backs U.S. bank breakups,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executive and White House adviser Gary Cohn shocked more than a few of his former Wall Street colleagues this week when he showed support for reinstating a Depression-era law that would break up the biggest U.S. banks. Here are some details about the law, called the Glass-Steagall Act, and why it has returned to the spotlight: WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL: Originally passed as part of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity. The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. WHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators. WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a “21st Century Glass-Steagall.” Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions. COULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warren’s proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system. ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules.

LYNCH MOB WINS By Less Than 1%…Why Republicans Are To Blame For LEFTIST DOUG JONES’ Victory,"They threw everything but the kitchen sink at Judge Roy Moore. Democrats outspent Moore 10-1, and more importantly, the Democrat Party unified, like they always do, to get behind their candidate (think Hillary Clinton), no matter their flaws, or how weak of a candidate he or she may be. Meanwhile, the Republicans did exactly what they always do they splintered, they argued amongst themselves, and they waited until the 11th hour to get behind Roy Moore, the Republican candidate who was accused (without evidence) by several women (one of whom admitted to committing forgery in a high school yearbook used as evidence of her claim against him) of sexual misconduct several decades ago. The media will try to blame this loss on President Trump, but the truth of the matter is, that the Republican Party came late to the game with funding and with support for Roy Moore, while half of the party either sat on their hands or openly condemned their candidate. The spineless Republican Party can take credit for the historic loss tonight in Alabama.AP   In a stunning victory aided by scandal, Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama s special Senate election on Tuesday, beating back history, an embattled Republican opponent and President Donald Trump, who urgently endorsed GOP rebel Roy Moore despite a litany of sexual misconduct allegations.It was the first Democratic Senate victory in a quarter-century in Alabama, one of the reddest of red states, and proved anew that party loyalty is anything but sure in the age of Trump.

Turkey orders former intelligence personnel detained in Gulen probe: AA,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey issued arrest warrants for 63 people, including former National Intelligence Agency (MIT) personnel, over alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric accused of orchestrating last year s attempted coup, Anadolu agency reported on Tuesday. The police operation was launched in 21 provinces across Turkey, the state-run news agency reported. Ankara says cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in the United States since 1999, was behind the abortive putsch in July 2016. Gulen has denied involvement. More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial for alleged ties to Gulen s movement and some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors for the same reason. Some of Turkey s Western allies and rights groups have expressed concern about the crackdown and suspect the government has used the coup as a pretext to quash dissent.

Turkish army surveys Syria's Idlib before deployment - sources,"AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted out Syria s Idlib province on Sunday, a senior Syrian rebel said, before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.  When we don t go to Syria, Syria comes to us,  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party.  If we didn t take our measures, bombs would fall on our cities.  Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands. Although Turkish officials say they are helping the rebels from within Turkey, in past interventions they have also sent troops across the frontier. Any incursion could bring them into conflict with powerful jihadists from al Qaeda s former Syrian branch, although there were signs on Sunday that they were working to avoid a confrontation. Local sources said the Turkish military vehicles were escorted into Idlib by a convoy of fighters from the group, which has joined a jihadist alliance called Tahrir al-Sham and disavowed links to the network founded by Osama bin Laden. Nonetheless, the jihadists and the Turkish military earlier exchanged fire nearby, underscoring the tension as Turkey builds up its forces and the rebel groups it backs prepare to enter Idlib.   We will never allow a terror corridor that begins in Afrin and goes to the Mediterranean,  Erdogan said, referring to the stretch of Turkey s southern border which is controlled on the Syrian side by Kurdish fighters and Tahrir al-Sham. Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups.     Prime Minister Binali Yildirim stressed the importance of ensuring de-escalation near the border, following an agreement reached in Astana, Kazakhstan last month that was backed both by the Turks and by Russia, which supports Assad.  We will ensure safety in Idlib, and will cooperate with Russia,  Yildirim said. Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former Nusra Front, which was al Qaeda s Syrian branch until last year when it changed its name and broke allegiance to the global network, has been a formidable military force since early in the conflict. Since early this year it has battled other rebel groups as it tried to gain control over areas including Idlib.  Idlib and neighboring parts of northwest Syria are now home to more than 2 million people, many of them refugees from other formerly rebel-held regions that fell to pro-government forces.      A local resident and another local rebel said they had seen Turkish military vehicles enter Idlib and then travel under Tahrir al-Sham escort along a road.  The senior Syrian rebel said the reconnaissance team went to Sheikh Barakat, a location that overlooks both rebel-held areas of Aleppo province, adjacent to Idlib, and the Kurdish-controlled area of Afrin.  Erdogan gave no details of the operation, but said it was going ahead  without problems at the moment . Turkey s biggest security concern on the frontier is the Kurdish YPG militia, which as part of a U.S.-backed alliance is fighting against Islamic State in eastern Syria. Ankara regards the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey. Mortars were fired from the area under YPG control near to the location where the Turkish reconnaissance team was operating, the senior rebel said.   The Turkish team is on its way back. Its mission has been accomplished. They visited areas of disengagement and locations where the Turkish army would be positioned,  the rebel said. Reuters witnesses, local people, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said earlier on Sunday the Turkish military and Tahrir al-Sham had clashed near the village of Kafr Lusin in Idlib.  Tahrir al-Sham began the exchange by firing on a Turkish bulldozer removing sections of a border wall and Turkish artillery returned fire, they said. The area was later quiet.  Rebel groups that will take part - drawn from the Euphrates Shield campaign that Turkey backed with armor and troops in another part of Syria to the east since last year - said on Saturday they expected the Idlib operation to start very soon. Tahrir al-Sham said  the lions of jihad and martyrdom will be waiting to pounce  against any incursion into Idlib. The Syrian Civil Defence, better known as the White Helmets rescue workers, said on its Twitter account that jets it believed to be from the Syrian military had struck a marketplace in Maarat al-Numan in Idlib on Sunday, killing at least six.

U.S. treads water on cyber policy as destructive attacks mount,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s refusal to publicly accuse Russia and others in a wave of politically motivated hacking attacks is creating a policy vacuum that security experts fear will encourage more cyber warfare. In the past three months, hackers broke into official websites in Qatar, helping to create a regional crisis; suspected North Korean-backed hackers closed down British hospitals with ransomware; and a cyber attack that researchers attribute to Russia deleted data on thousands of computers in the Ukraine. Yet neither the United States nor the 29-member NATO military alliance have publicly blamed national governments for those attacks. President Donald Trump has also refused to accept conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections using cyber warfare methods to help the New York businessman win. “The White House is currently embroiled in a cyber crisis of existential proportion, and for the moment probably just wants ‘cyber’ to go away, at least as it relates to politics,” said Kenneth Geers, a security researcher who until recently lived in Ukraine and works at NATO’s think tank on cyber defense. “This will have unfortunate side effects for international cyber security.” Without calling out known perpetrators, more hacking attacks are inevitable, former officials said.  “I see no dynamics of deterrence,” said ex-White House cyber security officer Jason Healey, now at Columbia University.  The government retreat is underscored by the departure at the end of July of Chris Painter, the official responsible for coordinating U.S. diplomacy on cyber security. No replacement has been named and the future of the position in the State Department is in flux. Some of Trump’s cyber officials have publicly highlighted a strategy to focus less on building global norms and more on bilateral agreements. Trump and the Kremlin have said Russia and the United States are in discussions on creating a cyber security group. But at the big Black Hat and Def Con security conferences this week in Las Vegas the U.S. government will have an unusually light footprint. Past government speakers have included a head of the National Security Agency and senior Homeland Security officials.  A session featuring U.S. law enforcement officials discussing the purported theft by Russia of hundreds of millions of Yahoo account credentials was pulled at the last minute. A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the presentation was canceled  because the Yahoo expert slated to talk, Deputy Assistant Director Eric Sporre, had been reassigned to run the Tampa FBI office. The policy vacuum left by the United States is also affecting private security firms, which say they have grown more cautious in publicly attributing cyber attacks to nation-states lest they draw fire from the Trump administration.  Trump suggested in an April interview that the security firm CrowdStrike, which worked on investigating the election hack of the Democratic National Committee, might not be trustworthy because he was told it was controlled by a Ukrainian. It is not. Cyber policy veterans are particularly alarmed about the lack of U.S. and NATO response to the destructive attack, dubbed NotPetya, in June that struck computers worldwide but was especially harmful for Ukraine, which is in armed conflict with Russia in the east of the country. Cyber security experts, such as Jim Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a government veteran who advised former President Barack Obama, believe Russia carried out the attack. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lewis and others predicted that Trump will not publicly accuse Russia, and NATO has only said it appears to be the work of a government agency somewhere. “If you are not ringing alarm bells in an eloquent way, then I think you’re dropping the ball,” said retired CIA officer Daniel Hoffman, who worked on Russian issues. “When we fail to do enough, that just emboldens them.” ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2017 ",1,4151

Myanmar journalists' group to don black T-shirts over arrest of Reuters' reporters,"YANGON (Reuters) - A group of Myanmar journalists said they would begin wearing black T-shirts on Saturday in protest at the detention of two Reuters reporters accused of violating the country s Official Secrets Act, as pressure builds on Myanmar to release the pair. The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, a group of local reporters who have demonstrated against past prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom . In a statement on Facebook, the committee said its members would don black T-shirts  to signify the dark age of media freedom  in Myanmar. They demanded the unconditional and immediate release of the two reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27.  Journalists all over the country are urged to take part in the Black Campaign,  the group said. It said it also planned to stage official protests and prayers. The group has staged several protests on behalf of arrested reporters from other media this year, including one in June in which around 100 journalists took part. It was not immediately clear how many journalists have joined the black T-shirt protest. The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists was formed in response to the arrest in June of a newspaper editor over the publication of a cartoon that made fun of the military, said video journalist A Hla Lay Thu Zar - one of the group s 21-member executive committee.  A reporter must have the right to get information and write news ethically,  said A Hla Lay Thu Zar in reference to the case of the two Reuters  journalists. Myo Nyunt, deputy director for Myanmar s Ministry of Information, told Reuters the case had nothing to do with press freedom.  It s related to the Official Secrets Act,  he said.  Journalists should be able to tell what is secret and what is not... We already have press freedom. There s freedom to write and speak... There s press freedom if you follow the rules.  Asked about the local reporters   black campaign , he said:  Everyone can express his feelings.       The journalists were arrested on Tuesday evening after they were invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of Myanmar s largest city, Yangon. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, and government officials from Canada, Britain, Sweden, and Bangladesh, have all called for their release. The two reporters had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis that has seen an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims flee from a fierce military crackdown on militants in western Rakhine state. The Ministry of Information said the journalists had  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media , and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs. It said they were being investigated under the 1923 Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. Human rights advocates say press freedom is under attack in Myanmar, where the young civilian-led government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi shares power with the military that ran the country for decades. At least 11 journalists have been detained in 2017, although some have since been released. Police told Wa Lone s wife on Thursday that the reporters were taken from Htaunt Kyant police station in north Yangon by an investigation team to an undisclosed location shortly after their arrest. They added the reporters would be brought back to the station in  two to three days at most . It is now four days since they were detained. Separately, police lieutenant colonel Myint Htwe of the Yangon Police Division told Reuters on Thursday the reporters  location would not be disclosed until the investigation was complete.  Since then, the authorities have not provided any further information on their whereabouts. ",worldnews,"December 16, 2017 ",1,3928

Warren to keep up assault on White House hopeful Trump over judge comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren will keep up her assault on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday in a strongly worded speech labeling Trump a racist and accusing the Republican Party of fostering his intolerance. “Donald Trump chose racism as his weapon, but his aim is exactly the same as the rest of the Republicans,” Warren will say in remarks to be delivered at a Washington meeting of the American Constitution Society, a liberal group. Warren, a fiery critic of Wall Street, is a favorite among liberals as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, who this week became the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump has drawn strong criticism, including from some Republican leaders, for his attacks on Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against his now defunct real estate training school. The Republican candidate has accused Curiel, an American  born in Indiana, of having an inherent bias against him because of his heritage and Trump’s campaign pledges on curbing illegal immigration, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “Judge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life,” Warren will say. “Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself.”     Thursday’s remarks will be just the latest in a war of words between Trump and Warren. Trump has dubbed Warren “goofy,” and often taunts her on the campaign trail, while Warren has branded Trump a “loser” and last month tweeted that his “record is embarrassing.” Reuters reported on Wednesday that Warren will soon endorse Clinton, after months of remaining neutral in the Democratic primary battle between Clinton and her challenger from the left, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Warren has considered the idea of serving as Clinton’s running mate although she sees obstacles to that choice, sources said. ",politicsNews,"June 9, 2016 ",1,2159
FACE BOOK’S “Open-Borders” MARK ZUCKERBERG Builds “Oppressive” “Immense” Wall Around Hawaii Home,"Breitbart News published a story about our 100 Percent FED Up Facebook page being hidden from the Facebook news feed after we began posting several stories a day on the topic of illegal immigration. After an investigation into our page settings by a Facebook employee, he discovered a  core function  was missing from our settings. The function that was missing from our page settings is what allows our page to be seen by a specific audience (or not at all). It s really quite ironic that the guy who s been doing everything in his power to make illegal alien a dirty word on Facebook, would build a massive wall around his Hawaiian domicile wouldn t you agree?For years, Kilauea, Kauai resident Gy Hall has enjoyed the view of the ocean and the breeze along Koolau Road. Then, a few weeks ago, a crew started to build a wall which happens to belong to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The feeling of it is really oppressive. It s immense,  Hall said.  It s really sad that somebody would come in, and buy a huge piece of land and the first thing they do is cut off this view that s been available and appreciative by the community here for years. Hall said the wall extends along Koolau Road, near mile marker 20, and is about six-feet tall. He said its projected length and completion are unclear.Multiple attempts by TGI to contact Shawn Smith, former Falk Partners manager, who Hall says sold some of the $200 million, 700-plus-acre property to the billionaire, were unsuccessful Friday Shosana Chantara, a Kilauea resident, voiced her concerns about the breeze that s being obstructed. It s hot behind that wall. Because it s up on a berm, there s not a breath of air on this side from the ocean,  Chantara said.  You take a solid wall that s 10 or more feet above the road level; the breeze can t go through. Another Kilauea resident, Donna Macmillan, calls the wall a  monstrosity.

 Virginia School Has Black Kid Arrested For Drinking Milk,"Seriously. This actually happened in America.Milk costs 65 cents at Graham Park Middle School in Prince William County, Virginia. But like millions of other children across the country, Ryan Turk is enrolled in the free lunch program because his family can t afford his meals.One day after going through the lunch line, Turk sat down and realized that he had forgotten to grab a milk so he went back and grabbed one like any other kid would do.Except that Ryan Turk is black, so the school security guard automatically assumed he stole it. He confronted Ryan, accused him of a crime, and demanded that he go to the principal s office. Ryan refused because he did nothing wrong.Rather than check out Ryan s story, which would have been as simple as looking at his tray and realizing that he only had one milk (which he would have known was free for Ryan if he had bothered to check if he is enrolled to get free school lunches), the security officer arrested him and charged him with disorderly conduct and petty larceny, charges that will now be on Ryan s record.The school gave Turk a choice, enroll in a diversion program by admitting to a crime he didn t commit, or face a trial in a courtroom.Again, this is all because Ryan went back for the milk he forgot as part of his lunch. It s a 65-cent milk for crying out loud, not the Mona Lisa.Rightfully so, Ryan s mother rejected the first choice.  My son is not going to admit to something he did not do,  she told the Washington Post.Turk and his mother also contend that race has something to do with the incident because Ryan has seen many other students do the exact same thing he did without being confronted by school security.The school has dismissed the accusation that racism had anything to do with the situation because the security guard and the principal are both black. But Turk s attorney Emmett Robinson begs to differ. It s not the players, it s not the people who discriminate; it s the whole system,  Robinson said,  The system is set up now so that school resource officers get to determine the impact on a person s life. Indeed, treating black kids like criminals has ended up creating a vicious cycle that has resulted in the disproportionate imprisonment of blacks in this country.There is little doubt that if Ryan had been white he would have never been approached by the security officer.The fact is that Ryan Turk was entitled to have a milk with his lunch, which is FREE. He just forgot it and merely did what he has seen other students do. Security did not have a problem with those other kids going back for their forgotten milk. So why did the security officer treat Ryan differently? Race must have played a role. And even if it didn t, having a child arrested over a 65-cent carton of milk is absolutely ridiculous. It s a waste of resources and a waste of the court s time.Surely, the school and the judiciary must have more important things to deal with.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 30, 2016",0,3026
TOP TEN LIES From Obama’s State Of The Union Speech,"Obama promised to keep his SOTU speech short but he couldn t even keep that promise. For anyone who watched it, it went on and on It was full of fairy tales about pretty much everything. So what s new, right? Obama s been able to lie his way through his entire presidency so why not in his last SOTU speech. We think this list of lies by Joel Pollack of Breitbart News is pretty dead on:1.  We ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it s not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He  cut  (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010.2.  Anyone claiming that America s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. With that line, Obama took a shot at his would-be Democratic successors, as well as his Republican critics. But the truth is that despite the slow recovery the slowest since World War II labor force participation is the lowest it has been in decades. Wages are stagnant, household incomes still have not recovered from the recession, and young people see ableak future.3.  That s what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we ll still have coverage. That is a cruel joke, given that Obamacare canceled insurance coverage for millions of Americans who did not change jobs. It also raised deductibles and premiums so high that many insurance companies are leaving the Obama exchanges totally.4.  Food Stamp recipients didn t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.  Actually, food stamp recipients, metaphorically speaking, were indirectly responsible as well as Wall Street sharks. Obama leaves out the government s role, under the Community Reinvestment Act, in pushing mortgages on people who could not afford them, and in backing the derivatives based on those mortgages that ultimately burst the whole bubble.5.  We ve protected an open internet . Obama s policy of Net Neutrality has turned Internet service providers into public utilities under an ancient regulatory regime. The result has been a sharp decline in broadband investment and a much less free and open system. In addition, the Obama administration is rushing to shift control of ICANN to the international community, which will ensure that the Internet is less free, and subject to overseas censorship.6.  Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results.  It is laughable that Obama would claim his failed clean energy spending think Solyndra led to the fracking-fed energy boom we have enjoyed for the past several years, especially when the administration did all it could to stop oil and gas development. He also nixed the Keystone pipeline and started a plan to kill coal plants.7.  No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that s the path to ruin.  Of all the lies in Obama s speech, this was undoubtedly the worst, coming hours after Iran seized two U.S. Navy boats and ten sailors. Obama did not even mention those Americans in captivity at any point in his speech, declining the chance to reassure the nation that they would come home safely. It is an omission that will define this address in history.8.  As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.  Obama does not attend most of his daily intelligence briefings, preferring instead to read intelligence reports so he claims on his iPad, a stark contrast to the attentive approach of his predecessor. Late last year, even as Obama claimed that there was little risk from attack, radical Islamic terrorists carried out brutal attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino.9.  We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria [from Islamic State].  The Obama administration s attempt to train and arm Syrian rebels has been a disaster. Belatedly, the administration has helped Kurdish peshmerga forces, and the Iraqi military has made gains lately, but Obama has not made a serious effort to defeat the Islamic State, and is even giving up on regime change in Syria.10.  Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America.  And a year of appeasement has not promoted democracy, either. The Castros remain firmly in power, and we are not helping the opposition. Worse, the Cuban regime continues to arrest thousands of political dissidents, to cozy up to enemies like Iran and North Korea, and to carry out provocative acts such as stealing a U.S. Hellfire missile.Read more: Breitbart News",politics,"Jan 13, 2016",0,4960
Trump ally Stone denies collusion with Russia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican political consultant Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, flatly denied allegations of collusion between the president’s associates and Russia during the 2016 U.S. election in a meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday. In a 47-page opening statement seen by Reuters before his appearance before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Stone said he viewed the meeting “as a political proceeding” and accused some committee members of making “provably false” statements to create the impression of collusion with Russia. After spending almost three hours behind closed doors taking questions from committee members, Stone again denied accusations that he had engaged in improper conduct during the 2016 campaign but was much more contentious than in the rambling statement. “I am aware of no evidence whatsoever of collusion by the Russian state or anyone in the Trump campaign,” Stone told reporters. The House panel is one of the main congressional committees investigating allegations that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election and probing whether any Trump associates colluded with Moscow. Russia denies any such efforts, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. Stone said he had had a frank exchange with committee members, but described some clashes between Democrats and Republicans. He said he answered all of their questions except for refusing to identify an “opinion journalist” who had acted as a go-between between Stone and Julian Assange. Assange is the publisher of WikiLeaks, which released emails stolen from Democrats that helped Trump’s campaign. After Stone spoke, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said Stone had declined to answer one line of questions and the panel might have to subpoena him to return and do so. Schiff declined to say whether those questions were related to Assange. Stone also said he had no prior knowledge about the hacking of emails of John Podesta, chairman of the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, or their release to Wikileaks, even though he referred to Podesta on Twitter just before the group posted the emails. Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican overseeing the committee’s investigation, later said that talk of a subpoena was “premature,” and told ABC News he wanted to give Stone a chance to cooperate. Stone, one of Trump’s closest political advisers in the years before he ran for president, was formerly a partner in a lobbying firm with Paul Manafort, a Trump campaign manager. Manafort has also been scrutinized in the investigations into Russia and the election. In July, FBI agents raided his home. Stone said Manafort’s attorneys had informed his attorneys that federal prosecutors planned to indict Manafort. Stone said he had not heard from Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian involvement in the election and possible collusion, and there were currently no plans for a similar appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Stone said he had spoken to Trump “recently,” but not about his appearance before the committee. In his written statement, Stone accused the committee of cowardice because he was not allowed to testify in an open forum. He said he wanted the transcript of his interview to be released. “I am most interested in correcting a number of falsehoods, misstatements, and misimpressions regarding allegations of collusion between Donald Trump, Trump associates, The Trump Campaign and the Russian state,” Stone said in the statement. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia sought to influence the election to boost Trump’s chances of defeating Clinton. In his statement, Stone acknowledged his reputation as a tough political strategist, but said he did not engage in any illegal activities. “There is one ‘trick’ that is not in my bag and that is treason,” he said.

Democratic lawmakers question Kushner on New York property: letter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday wrote to Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, asking whether in his talks with foreign officials he had ever discussed financing for a deeply indebted Kushner Companies property in Manhattan. The property at 666 Fifth Avenue has a $1.15 billion mortgage due in less than two years, and has raised concerns among lawmakers that it could pose a conflict of interest for Kushner.  Kushner headed Kushner Companies until he sold his interest to a family trust earlier this year. He is a senior adviser to the president and has been involved in Middle East policymaking. The 13 Democratic lawmakers, in their two-page letter to Kushner and seen by Reuters, said: “We are concerned that you may be leveraging your White House position to seek financial assistance for 666 Fifth Avenue, which according to various reports has at least $1.2 billion in debt, of which more than half is owned” by Kushner Companies. A White House spokesman declined comment on the letter and referred the matter to Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell. Lowell could not immediately be reached for comment. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, has questioned Kushner. It is not known whether Mueller’s team is looking into issues involving 666 Fifth Avenue. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials. The letter from the lawmakers, led by Rep. Ted Lieu of California, asked whether, since Trump’s election on Nov. 8, 2016, Kushner has discussed the property “with any foreign nationals or entities” in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, China, Israel, France or other countries. If so, they asked, “did you discuss anything related to helping finance, purchase, or assist with the debt on 666 Fifth Avenue?” The lawmakers asked Kushner to respond by Dec. 12.

 Colbert Grills Sanders On His ‘Revolution For America’ — Sanders’ Response Is Brilliant (VIDEO),"Senator Bernie Sanders made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert a day following his landslide win in New Hampshire and he was riding high. Colbert resurrected his former conservative Colbert Report character, playing devil s advocate by grilling  the senator on his polices, even suggesting that he was promoting  class warfare.  Colbert said that trying to take power away from the 1% was not going to be easy.  I ll tell you how I know, I am in the top 1 percent.  Colbert also warned of revolution which Sanders advocates by quoting John F. Kennedy. He said: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. Sanders, however, rejected the idea that his revolution would go bad. He said: What the goal of this campaign is about is to look at the Civil Rights Movement, look at the women s movement, look at the gay movement, understand that when people come together we can accomplish enormous things. But I think what people are saying is enough is enough. We need fundamental changes in our political system and our economic system. Sanders is right. Thinking outside of the box is what creates both innovation and change and Sanders sums it up perfectly: We used to have a segregated society. African-Americans couldn t go to schools, couldn t drink at water fountains. Millions of people stood together and said,  Hey, enough is enough. That is not what America is supposed to be about. Americans are on board with Sanders  message. He s scored a resounding victory in New Hampshire, especially with America s youth, collecting 86% of the vote in the 18-24 age bracket.

Anthony Weiner checks into sex addiction rehab clinic: Daily Mail,"(Reuters) - Disgraced former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner has checked into a rehab facility that treats sex addiction, the DailyMail.com reported on Wednesday. The online version of the British newspaper said electronic devices are banned at the facility, which separates men from women and treats a range of addictions related to cyber sex, exhibitionism and anonymous sex and other acts. The facility was not named in the report. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Weiner could not be reached for comment. Federal prosecutors and New York police announced last month they were investigating Weiner following a separate report by the DailyMail.com that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messages with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina. Weiner, 52, did not respond at the time to Reuters’ requests for comment on the texting report but told the Associated Press last month that he had “likely been the subject of a hoax.” An investigation into those messages also triggered a new FBI probe of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails, as some of her emails were found on a device related to the Weiner investigation, sources close to the matter said. Once a popular congressman, Weiner resigned in 2011 after saying he had accidentally sent a lewd picture over Twitter. Two years later, his campaign for New York City mayor was derailed after explicit photos he had sent under the pseudonym “Carlos Danger” to a young woman in Indiana surfaced. Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s top aides, said in August she was separating from her husband after yet another scandal. Abedin’s announcement followed a New York Post report that Weiner had recently sent photos of his boxer-brief-clad genitals – one while he was in bed with their toddler son – via Twitter to another woman. An attorney for Abedin could not be reached on Wednesday to comment on the DailyMail.com report. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1,2010
One-time Trump adviser Page sees opportunities in Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Carter Page, a businessman previously described as a foreign-policy adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, said on Friday he saw significant business opportunities in Russia. Page arrived in Moscow on Thursday and told Russia’s RIA news agency he was visiting Russia to work on economic projects. The current nature of his relationship with Trump’s team is unclear. “I firmly believe that the opportunities for cooperation with the private sector of the Russian economy have never been as great as they will be in coming years,” Page was quoted as saying. “Despite the West’s antagonistic policy and the unavoidable reaction of Moscow, which limited these opportunities in the past few decades, the possibilities today are unique.” Page has previously worked in Russia, spending three years in Moscow at U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch, but his credentials came under scrutiny after being named as one of the people briefing then presidential candidate Trump. He told RIA an $11.3 billion deal for Qatar and Swiss trader Glencore (GLEN.L) to buy a state stake in Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM), announced earlier this week, showed sanctions on Russia hurt Western firms. “The hostile efforts to punish Rosneft and a group of its senior executives with the help of Western sanctions have mainly hurt Western firms and not achieved their goal,” he said.

Greek archaeologists clear way for Hellenikon resort,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece welcomed a decision by senior archaeologists to conditionally permit a major tourism project in Athens on Wednesday, saying it cleared the way for the country to turn the site into one of Europe’s biggest coastal resorts. The 8 billion euro ($9.4 billion) project to develop the disused Hellenikon airport site is a key term of Greece’s international bailout and is closely watched by its official creditors and potential investors in the crisis-hit country. Greek developer Lamda signed a 99-year lease with the state in 2014 for the 620-hectare (1,530-acre) area, once the site of Athens airport. But the project has faced delays, partly over a long-running row between developers and those who fear it will damage the environment and cultural heritage. After three inconclusive meetings in recent weeks, the Central Archaeological Council, an advisory body, recommended on Tuesday that about 30 hectares (74 acres) of the 620-hectare plot under the project be declared an archaeological site. “The decision is fine,” Deputy Economy Minister in charge of investments, Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters. “The fact that a small area is declared of archaeological interest shields the whole process from future litigation.” Pitsiorlas said the recommendation meant that archaeologists will have a closer supervision of construction work. Backed by Chinese and Gulf funds, Lamda submitted its detailed development plan for Hellenikon in July, setting off a licensing process which will wrap up with a decree. The Council approved the plan on Tuesday and designated specific areas where construction should not be allowed. It was not immediately clear how the Council’s recommendation could affect Lamda’s construction plan. Lamda said it was waiting to be officially notified over the decision before making any public statement, noting that “the importance of the archaeological findings has been included from the beginning in the company’s undertakings”. It said it should be able to assess the impact of the Council’s decision on its development plan once it has reviewed the resolutions and accompanying diagrams. The recommendation is not binding, however, the culture ministry always respects the body’s decisions. Greece on Monday overcame another hurdle to the project by winning an appeal over objections by forestry officials. Hellenikon has become a major political issue in Greece, which is slowly emerging from a multi-year debt crisis.  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose leftist party strongly opposed it before coming to power in 2015, is now seen as keen to implement the deal to help boost economic activity and reduce unemployment, the euro zone’s highest.  Referring to the council’s decision, Deputy Foreign Minister Giannis Amanatidis said it was “a complicated process which was resolved in the best possible way”.

IT’S ABOUT TIME! 19 GOP Congressmen Call For Closer Look Into Mueller’s Team Of Political Hack Lawyers,"All we can say about this development is that it s about time the GOP Congressman did something about the wild goose chase Mueller and his team have been going on.Nineteen Republican congressmen signed on to a letter (see a screenshot of the letter at the bottom of this article) sent out Friday requesting congressional hearings to keep special counsel Robert Mueller and his team of lawyers accountable.

 Trump’s New Pathetic Anti-Hillary Ad Frames Bill Clinton As A Rapist (VIDEO),"If there s anyone who shouldn t be pointing fingers at other men for the mistreatment of women, it s probably Donald Trump. Yet today, Trump completely ignored his grotesque track record with women, as well as his own rape allegations for the sake of a childish attack on his rival, Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton.In the complete absence of self-awareness, Trump posted an attack ad on Hillary today via Instagram, bringing to light past allegations of sexual assault against her husband, former president Bill Clinton. This isn t the first time Trump has attacked the Clintons this way, and they ve done a decent job defending themselves. But this time, Trump has taken things a step further by actually using recordings of the victims accusing Bill. As the ad comes to a close, Hillary is heard laughing while ominous music plays in the background.You can watch the attack ad below:Is Hillary really protecting women?A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 23, 2016 at 8:27am PDTAs Hillary has positioned herself as being a champion for women (as she was long before her presidential campaign began), Trump feels that his best shot at turning female voters away from the former Secretary of State is to highlight her husband s problematic sexual past.The interesting thing about this is that Trump himself has seemingly forgotten that he has also been accused of rape. In trying to smear the Clintons with this nasty ad, Trump has ironically and unintentionally made a case against himself. In the 1990s, Trump s first wife Ivana had accused the business mogul of brutally raping her while they were still married. Here s what Ivana said, which appeared in the Trump biography Lost Tycoon:Ivanka Trump statementAnd Trump s misogynistic attitudes toward women don t stop there. He s been accused of groping women, being super creepy when it comes to sexualizing his own daughter, has attacked numerous female celebrities, personalities and politicians   including Fox News  Megyn Kelly and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and said that women should be punished for seeking abortions. Not to mention, there is a never-ending list of every misogynistic, sexist thing Trump has said or done to women. So while Trump is trying to soil the Clintons  name, all he s really done is just put a spotlight on himself. There s a reason why almost 75% of American women don t like The Donald, but he seems to live in denial.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 23, 2016",0,2543
Trump to sign order sweeping away Obama-era climate policies,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to undo a slew of Obama-era climate change regulations, a move meant to bolster domestic energy production but which environmentalists have vowed to challenge in court. The decree, dubbed the “Energy Independence” order, will seek to undo former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants - a critical element in helping the United States meet its commitments to a global climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in December 2015.  It will also rescind a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, reverse rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production, and reduce the weight of climate change in federal agencies’ assessments of new regulations. “We’re going to go in a different direction,” a senior White House official told reporters ahead of Tuesday’s order. “The previous administration devalued workers with their policies. We can protect the environment while providing people with work.” Trump will sign the order at the EPA with the agency’s Administrator Scott Pruitt, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday afternoon.  The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in Trump’s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during his campaign for the presidency. “I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration’s commitment to the coal industry,” Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters. Environmental groups have promised to challenge the orders. “These actions are an assault on American values and they endanger the health, safety and prosperity of every American,” said billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, the head of activist group NextGen Climate.  Green group Earthjustice said it will fight the order both in and out of court. “This order ignores the law and scientific reality,” said the group’s president Trip Van Noppen.  Trump campaigned on a promise to sweep aside green regulations he said hurt the economy, and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Since being elected, however, he has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it. The White House official said Trump’s administration was discussing its approach to the accord, meant to limit the planet’s warming by reducing carbon emissions. The order will direct the EPA to start a formal “review” process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but has never been implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican states.  The review is likely to trigger legal challenges by environmental groups and some state attorneys general that could last years. The Clean Power Plan would have required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.  ",politicsNews,"March 28, 2017 ",1,3165
State Dept. subpoenaed documents from Clinton Foundation: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. State Department investigators last year issued a subpoena to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation seeking documents about projects run by the charity that may have required U.S. government approval when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. A U.S. official said the matter was being investigated by the Inspector General, the State Department’s internal watchdog. Citing unnamed sources for the report, the Post said the subpoena issued in the fall also asked for records related to senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who for six months in 2012 simultaneously worked for several employers including the State Department, the foundation, and Clinton’s personal office. The report follows a Reuters investigation last year that found the Clinton Foundation’s flagship health project did not submit new or increased payments from at least seven foreign governments to the State Department for review, in breach of the ethics agreement Clinton signed with the incoming Obama administration in order to become secretary of state. Clinton, who is running for the Democratic nomination in the Nov. 8 presidential election, has been criticized for using a private email account hosted on a private computer while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, a matter the FBI is investigating. Spokesmen for Clinton’s campaign and the Clinton Foundation and a lawyer for Abedin did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. A spokesman for the Inspector General also declined to comment. The Post quoted an unnamed foundation representative as saying the initial document request had been narrowed by investigators and that the foundation was not the focus of the probe. It said there was no indication that the investigators were looking at Clinton. “The full scope and status of the inquiry, conducted by the State Department’s inspector general, were not clear from the material correspondence reviewed by the Washington Post,” the paper said. Sources familiar with investigations into the controversy surrounding Clinton’s private email server said they had no reason to believe any government agency was conducting any kind of inquiry into possible criminal violations related to the former secretary of state.

 President Obama Slams Republicans For Toying With American Lives By Blocking Zika Funding (VIDEO),"President Obama used this week s  Weekly Address  to discuss the Zika virus and slam the Republicans who have chosen to block the funding necessary to fight the spread of this mosquito-borne disease.The president began by talking about a call he had gotten from a pregnant woman named Ashley who said she was  extremely concerned  about Zika and  what it might mean for other pregnant women like her.  He added that, as a father, he shared this mother s worry. Conservatives in Congress on the other hand, not so much. Republicans in Congress did not share Ashley s  extreme concern,  nor that of other Americans expecting children. They said no. Instead, we were forced to use resources we need to keep fighting Ebola, cancer, and other diseases. We took that step because we have a responsibility to protect the American people  said Obama.  But that s not a sustainable solution. And Congress has been on a seven-week recess without doing anything to protect Americans from the Zika virus. Obama said that his  Administration has done what we can on our own,  but that is not nearly enough to stop the spread of this disease. He explained the steps that citizens can take to try to protect themselves from the mosquitos who carry and spread the virus: use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants, get rid of standing water where mosquitos breed, etc.And then, President Obama tore into the Republican lawmakers who have been dragging their feet when it comes to funding the measures that will stop the threat of this disease, which is known to cause serious birth defects when a pregnant woman is infected, including microcephaly. But every day that Republican leaders in Congress wait to do their job, every day our experts have to wait to get the resources they need   that has real-life consequences. Weaker mosquito-control efforts. Longer wait times to get accurate diagnostic results. Delayed vaccines. It puts more Americans at risk. One Republican Senator has said that  There is no such thing as a Republican position on Zika or Democrat position on Zika because these mosquitoes bite everyone.' I agree. We need more Republicans to act that way because this is more important than politics. It s about young mothers like Ashley. Today, her new baby Savannah is healthy and happy. That s priority number one. And that s why Republicans in Congress should treat Zika like the threat that it is and make this their first order of business when they come back to Washington after Labor Day. That means working in a bipartisan way to fully fund our Zika response. A fraction of the funding won t get the job done. You can t solve a fraction of a disease. Our experts know what they re doing. They just need the resources to do it.

EU aims to reopen embassy in Libya,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is seeking to reopen its embassy in Libya pending security conditions, officials said on Tuesday, offering further political support for the Tripoli government struggling to establish control. EU leaders will announce at their summit in Brussels on Oct. 19-20 that they  encourage work underway to rapidly establish a permanent EU presence in Libya , according to their draft joint statement seen by Reuters. But the statement makes clear no such move is imminent as it would be conditional on improving the security situation on the ground. The EU moved its mission to neighboring Tunisia in mid-2014 as security worsened in Libya amid escalating fighting between rival factions since the 2011 fall of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi, ousted by rebels during a NATO bombing campaign.  Of 28 EU states, only Italy, Libya s former colonial master and still the most influential European state on the ground, has an embassy in the country, where the United Nations has officially recognized the government of Fayez Seraj. The EU has also engaged increasingly with Seraj, especially as it sought Libya s help in curbing the flow of African refugees and migrants, hundreds of thousands of whom have been boarding smugglers  boats on the coast of the lawless state to cross the Mediterranean for Europe.  The bloc has financed, equipped and trained Libya s border and coast guards, despite rights groups sounding alarm over grave abuses refugees and migrants suffer in Libya.

Puerto Rico rescue plan strains U.S. Republican caucus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading Republicans on Tuesday outlined a plan to help Puerto Rico shed crippling debt and accused investor-allied groups of misleading lawmakers about the proposal. The rescue would steer creditors and holders of Puerto Rico bonds toward a new, independent board that would seek a fair way to write down an estimated $70 billion in debt. Banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and Puerto Rico citizens all hold paper issued by 18 entities on the U.S. commonwealth and many of those investors, if not all, would face a loss. Lawmakers in Congress are being lobbied - and attacked - by investor groups that are trying to protect their bottom lines. “They are deceitful,” said Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who leads the House Natural Resources Committee. Bishop said accusations likening the Puerto Rico rescue plan to a government bailout were “crap,” and the plan had the virtue of “protecting taxpayers and not spending government money.” The rescue plan does, however, adopt some principles of bankruptcy law and that makes it controversial. Investors could be forced into a settlement over the objections of holdout bondholders under certain circumstances, according to a draft of the bill. Some lawmakers said allowing Puerto Rico to modify its bonds could mean chaos for municipal markets. “If they can do it for Puerto Rico, they can do it for every other state,” Rep. Tom McClintock said of the damage that the rescue bill would do. McClintock, a California Republican, said he was “very concerned” about the plan after a half-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon of Republicans on the Natural Resources panel. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that he supported Bishop’s effort because it “holds the right people accountable for the crisis (and) shrinks the size of government.” Ryan also said he liked the idea of an independent board settling investor disputes, adding that legislation passed last week to halt payments on Puerto Rico’s debt was “troubling.” The Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative lawmakers, said in a statement it was still reviewing the bill, but “we are encouraged that there appear to be some improvements.” Ryan will need the votes of many fiscally-conservative Republicans - and as is seen likely, some Democrats - if he is to get the rescue package through the House of Representatives. The plan will face a test on Wednesday when the Natural Resources panel begins to amend the plan during a law-writing session known as a “mark up.” An aide to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said her office was still reviewing the legislation.

Lordy! Ex-FBI chief sets Twitter abuzz but @realDonaldTrump is silent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey’s long-anticipated congressional testimony set off a social media storm on Thursday with millions of people jumping into the fray but there was one notable absence - the tweeter in chief himself. President Donald Trump’s ordinarily red-hot Twitter handle, @realDonaldTrump, was dormant during the three-hour hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, although another Trump helped carry the mantle. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, live tweeted throughout Comey’s testimony, taking the ex-FBI director to task for his version of what the president told him. Twitter had a field day with other moments of Comey’s testimony, including his revelation that he broke a date with his wife in order to have dinner with Trump and his use of the exclamation “Lordy.” Comey’s disclosure that the person who leaked his memos of meeting with Trump was a Columbia Law School professor led to a stampede on the school’s website, causing it to crash. Here are some highlights of what excited Twitter during the testimony. Trump Jr. took issue with Comey’s comments about whether the president was ordering him to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “Knowing my father for 39 years when he ‘orders or tells’ you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,” he tweeted.  (here) “Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that,” he concluded, adding the hashtag “#givemeabreak”. (here) With his father’s Twitter handle silent, @DonaldJTrumpJr became the 10th most mentioned Twitter handle in the Comey conversation, according to social media analysis firm Brandwatch. One remark in particular from Comey got the Twittersphere buzzing. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” he told the committee regarding whether Trump had recorded their conversation. “Lordy” quickly became the focus of numerous memes, animated graphics and calls for T-shirts. Even the Merriam-Webster dictionary got into the act, tweeting out the definition of “Lordy” as a word used to “express surprise or strength of feeling.”  (here) Twitter said Comey’s “Lordy” remark was among the top three most tweeted moments during the testimony. Social media also poked fun when Comey revealed a presidential intrusion into his domestic life. “I had to call my wife and break a date with her,” Comey said. “I was supposed to take her out to dinner that night.”  “Moral of the #Comey testimony: Don’t cancel a date with your wife,” said CBS-Chicago reporter Jeremy Ross on Twitter. (here) Columbia Law School’s website became overburdened after Comey said he had asked a good friend who is a professor there to leak memos from his meeting with Trump to the media. Daniel Richman later confirmed to Reuters he was the one to whom Comey referred in his testimony. Shortly after the mention by Comey, the school tweeted: “Columbia Law’s site is down at the moment. We are working on a solution. Stay tuned.” (here) ",politicsNews,"June 8, 2017 ",1,3118
Cuba and U.S. officials to meet next week to deepen detente,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States will meet next week for a third round of talks on improving relations, Havana said on Thursday, adding that the two former Cold War foes were not yet negotiating their multibillion-dollar claims against one another. A bilateral commission will meet next Monday in the Cuban capital to evaluate the progress made in putting their decades-old conflict behind them, and to identify new areas of cooperation, said Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for U.S. affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry. “We will set the agenda for the rest for the year,” Machin told a news conference. “We are not yet negotiating the topic of claims even if there is a recognition on both sides that these exist.” Cuba and the U.S. reestablished diplomatic relations a year ago and have signed agreements on issues of common concern such as the environment, postal services and direct flights. Many differences remain however. Machin reiterated Cuba’s demands for the return of the Guantanamo naval base and lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. Cuba complains that some of the policy changes the U.S. has carried out, such as relaxing currency restrictions against the island, have had little real impact given the persistent fear among U.S. institutions of risking government sanctions. The White House said in March it would allow U.S. banks to process dollar transactions for Cuba as long as neither buyer nor seller were U.S. entities. “Until now, no bank transactions have been carried out in U.S. currency,” Machin said. “There is still a great fear.” Cuba has said it will only lift a 10 percent tax on cash dollars once it is clear U.S. banks are processing dollar transactions for the Communist-ruled island. The issue of reparations is another sticky point. Late last year, Cuba and the U.S. outlined their respective claims, with the former demanding at least $121 billion in reparations for the U.S. trade embargo and other acts it describes as aggressions against the Caribbean country. The Americans meanwhile are seeking upwards of $10 billion in compensation for nationalized properties. The third bilateral commission will be led by Josefina Vidal, the Cuban Foreign Ministry’s chief of U.S. affairs, and Kristie Kenney, counselor for the U.S. State Department.

As cheerful music plays in the background viewers are entertained with scenes of pre-teen girls playing with things like rockets and engineering sets.The narrator goes on, saying: To show just how far we ve come, Mattel is proud to introduce President Barbie, the first Barbie Commander In Chief. After this exciting build up, the scene shifts back to the girls, who just don t seem that into the doll. Oh, neat,  one of them replies half-heartedly, before putting the Barbie down to return to the construction set in front of her. Don t you want to play with her?  the narrator asks, adding,  She s a girl, just like you. The girl responds by saying,  Ya, but girls don t have to play with dolls. We can play with whatever we want. The narrator replies,  That s true, you don t have to play with dolls, but it would be great if you played with this doll right now. To this, one of the girls replies,  I like Legos. The mock spokesperson tries to boost the kids  interest in the doll by saying: Oh but look, President Barbie even comes with sunglasses and a smart phone with Snapchat. Do you like her now? The girls remain unimpressed. One of them replies,  It feels like she s trying too hard. The narrator explains: She is trying hard because there was a time when Barbie couldn t even be president. In response one of the kids sums it up by saying: I wasn t alive then.

LOL! New York Times Publishes Lengthy Article On Dem Senator’s Corruption Trial…Leaves ONE CRITICAL DETAIL Out Of Their Story,"While Facebook has hired an entire team of employees to weed out  fake news , their crack-team of censorship stooges consider news sources like the New York Times to the be the  gold standard  for the industry The New York Times published an almost 1300-word news story on Monday night about Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez s corruption trial, without ever mentioning Menendez s party affiliation.Both in print and on social media, the NYT failed to inform its readers that Sen. Menendez is a Democrat. For the first time in 36 years, a sitting United States Senator is facing a federal bribery trial,  read a NYT tweet promoting the story, which was titled:  Menendez Trial Set to Begin With Tensions High and Washington Watching. The NYT wasn t without opportunities to inform its readers which party Menendez belonged to: the paper referred to Menendez 29 times in the story, without once ever mentioning that Menendez is a Democrat.The paper referred to him as  The senator,   Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey,  and  Mr. Menendez, a senior senator,  before referring to him as  Mr. Menendez  or  the senator  for the rest of the story. Only after a barrage of online criticism did the NYT note that Menendez is a Democrat, adding in the identifier in the fourth paragraph.  Daily Caller ",politics,"Sep 14, 2017",0,1429
AWESOME PHOTOS CAPTURE A “Badass” Trump And His Retired Navy Seal Cabinet Member On Horseback,"While visiting the USS Gerald R.

We think he looks pretty spectacular, and would go as far as to say that he looks like a pretty  badass  Commander In Chief. President Trump started his speech by saying:  They just gave me this beautiful jacket. They said  here Mr President, please take this home . I said  let me wear it . Here are a few photos from our Commander in Chief s visit aboard the USS Gerald R.

MARK LEVIN: AL QAEDA and ISIS “Actively” Using Schumer’s Diversity Visa Program To “Put Sleepers In Our Country” [VIDEO],"Two nights ago, Mark Levin dropped a bombshell on his show about the Muslim terrorist who killed 9 people in Manhattan and injured dozens. The Diversity VISA immigration program that allowed the Muslim terrorist, and 23 people who were tied to his lottery draw from Uzbekistan to live in the United States, was given the brainchild of none other than New York s own Democrat senator, Chuck Schumer.Mark Levin; NYC muslim terrorist came to US under  Diversity VISA Program    a bizarre lottery to shove more foreigners down our throats  Deplorable MD   (@MDDeplorable) October 31, 2017Numbers USA breaks down Senator Chuck Schumer s Diversity Visa immigration program: The Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) began working directly with Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his staff to draft a diversity program that differed significantly from those considered up to that point. The Schumer proposal would have set aside 75,000 visas each year for a new category of  diversity immigrants. 112 Under this proposal, the world would be separated into  high-admission regions  and  low-admission regions,  within which would be  high-admission states  and  low-admission states.  High-admission states would be those from which at least 25,000 immigrants had come to the United States within the most recent five-year period. While no state would be allocated more than seven percent of available visas, the bulk of visas would go to low-admission states in low-admission regions, with a much smaller number allotted to low-admission states in high-admission regions. Any visas not used by the state to which they were allocated would go to the remaining eligible states.Last night, nationally syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin slammed the Diversity Immigrant Visa (green card lottery) program in an interview with Sean Hannity on FOX News Tuesday night. He said a lottery is no way to run an immigration system. Levin said a caller, a counter-intelligence veteran, told him al Qaeda and ISIS are  actively  using the program to install sleeper cells in the U.S It took effect in 1995,  Levin said of the bill.  People go online and they apply. They apply online. It s a lottery system. That is no way to run immigration system. I had a caller on my radio program tonight and he said, he used to work counterintelligence. Al Qaeda and ISIS have actively been working to use this program to put sleepers in our country. Levin said we have forgotten what the purpose of immigration is. Immigration is supposed to benefit the United States, not to ensure diversity from the foreigners coming into this country. Immigration is supposed to improve the United States it has nothing to do with improving other countries and so forth,  he said. This mass killer has claimed an association with ISIS, hasn t he? This diversity visa program should be gutted. We don t need a diversity visa program with 50,000 people a year come into this country through a lottery system, because we want diversity from different countries,  Levin declared.Levin said after 9/11, you would have thought people would take the issue of immigration more seriously. Immigration is about national security,  the broadcaster said.  Once people get into the country it becomes far more complicated. So you want to stop them at the border. And when the President of the United States said, as he did when he first came into office, we can t vet these people. Some of these governments are effective war with us and some of them don t exist. Some of them are involved in civil war. You know, we can t call Yemen and say, hey, can you check this guy out on your computer system? There is no computer system. There is no effective government. What the President is saying is  you can t bring people in from these countries until we figure out what s going on.   Real Clear Politics",left-news,"Nov 2, 2017",0,3972
" REPORT: Mueller Hot On Trump’s Trail, Has Built His Own ‘Miniature Justice Department’","Donald Trump is very afraid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It has been reported repeatedly that he is completely obsessed with the Russia investigation, and it seems that he is right to be. According to a new report in the Daily Beast, Mueller has built what they are calling an  army  of lawyers to investigate just what went on with Russia s interference into the 2016 presidential election, and especially into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials.The new report says that Mueller s team now includes 16 heavy-hitting attorneys, and they have space deep inside one of the most secret locations in Washington, and the space includes a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCHIF), which is the name for places no laymen and laywomen like us will ever see the inside of. The secrets kept in there are pretty much in a tomb, until those privy to them see fit to release them. On top of all of that, it seems that Mueller has pulled together what the Daily Beast is calling his own  Miniature Justice Department. The Daily Beast assembled a list of the names on Mueller s team, and their resumes are nothing short of stellar. Only one has never worked as a federal prosecutor, but he is a top notch lawyer in his own right and is surely useful. You can read the lengthy accomplishments of these attorneys here.In short   Trump is right to be scared out of his mind. It also bears noting that sometime ago now, Mueller actually convened his own grand jury   which means he has enough to believe he will stumble upon something that will warrant criminal indictments. Further, this team of lawyers has broad authority to subpoena anyone and everyone in Trump s orbit and force them to testify under oath. Also, remember   even if they aren t under oath, lying to government officials is still a crime, so these people better start learning to tell the truth unless they want to face some serious jail time.Come on, Special Counsel Mueller. We re rooting for you. With any luck, everyone in Trump s White House will be thrown out of office and in jail before the 2018 midterms.Featured image via Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images ",News,"August 25, 2017",0,2255

Looking forward to bringing the Party together —- and it will happen!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The meeting at party headquarters in Washington came on the heels of months of tension between Trump and the party he seeks to represent in the Nov. 8 election.

More worries in Congress over cuts at U.S. State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior U.S. senators asked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday to explain “questionable management practices” at his department that they believe are weakening the country’s diplomatic power, adding to a chorus of concern in Congress. Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen delivered a letter to Tillerson asking him to begin consulting with lawmakers on decisions that have an impact on recruiting, retaining and staffing the State Department, removing a hiring freeze and resuming promotions. McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Shaheen is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s subcommittee on State Department management. “While we support reasonable steps to improve the efficiency of the State Department, such efforts must be fully transparent, with the objective of enhancing, not diminishing, American diplomacy,” the senators wrote. They said declining morale, recruitment and retention of staff, a lack of experienced leadership and reports that diplomacy is becoming less effective “paint a disturbing picture.” Many members of Congress, Democrats as well as some of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans, have rejected Trump’s proposal to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent. Tillerson has embraced the plan, and imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency’s operations and deciding how to reorganize them. On Tuesday, the Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee both blasted the agency for cuts in staff and what they described as a failure to have a plan for a proposed organization. The panel’s top Democrat, Senator Ben Cardin, reiterated his concerns on Wednesday. “Our national security is being jeopardized by the employment and career decisions being made at the State Department,” he told reporters. It was not immediately clear how lawmakers could press the administration to change its policies, especially because Trump’s fellow Republicans, most of whom vote consistently with the president, hold majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. A State Department representative said the department had received the letter and would “appropriately respond.” Tillerson has said his reorganization plan aimed to increase efficiency and to cut costs, with a target of saving at least 10 percent, or about $5 billion, over the next five years from fiscal-year 2017 levels.  Cardin said the impact of disorganization at the State Department was being felt internationally. “I could mention almost every place in the world,” he said.

 Bill Maher Did NOT Disappoint In His Reaction To Sarah Palin’s Endorsement Of Trump (VIDEO),"There s really no better person to roast Sarah Palin than Bill Maher, and he most definitely didn t disappoint on Friday s edition of his HBO show. After the failed vice presidential candidate and half-term governor of Alaska endorsed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump this past week, it s been pretty much nonstop coverage of her idiocy. After all, the woman showed up, dressed in wind chimes, and was clearly either drunk or overly caffeinated. Any way you put it, no one put it better than Maher when he stated: Trump and Gump. Fatman and Little Brain  it was really something. Did you happen to see any of her speech? Oh my God. It was like a crazy drunk bridesmaid grabbed the mic at a wedding reception. This woman has a thousand stupid clich s in her head, and when she opens her mouth, it s like they re all escaping a nightclub fire. He then showed a clip of all her craziness during the endorsement, and said: You cannot put into words how much she cannot put something into words. Maher also brought up Palin blaming her son s domestic violence on Obama somehow not respecting the troops, saying:  and that s what makes the Republican party the party of personal responsibility  If Obama would just secure the borders, maybe Bristol would stop getting knocked up all the time. And that s really the truth of all of it. Sarah Palin wants to pretend that she s some high and mighty person, somehow morally superior to others, but the truth of the matter is, her son beats up women, and her daughter needs to learn where the condom aisle is. Palin is a walking and talking joke, and the sooner she realizes this the better.Kudos to Bill Maher for utterly annihilating Palin and her craziness.

Putin says U.S. 'hysteria' over Russia is election ploy,"KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused American politicians of whipping up hysteria about a mythical Russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. Putin, addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern Russia, repeatedly lashed out at the Obama administration, saying it did not keep its word on Syria, did not honour deals, and had falsely accused Moscow of all manner of sins.     The U.S. government has formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organisations, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has accused Republican rival Donald Trump of being a Putin “puppet”. Putin said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought Moscow was capable of influencing the Nov. 8 election. “Hysteria has been whipped up,” said Putin.  He said that was a ruse to cover up for the fact that the U.S. political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the country’s national debt or gun control. “It’s much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people’s choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.” In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Putin’s remarks as predictable and said the United States stood by its hacking allegations.  “There’s nothing that President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the president’s confidence in the analysis that’s been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community,” said Earnest. Russian state TV and some of his past comments have suggested the Russian leader favours Trump, but Putin said he did not back any candidate in the U.S. election and was ready to work with any new U.S. president and to discuss any issue.  Asked about Trump, whom he once described as “very talented,” Putin said the Republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the U.S. political elite. “He has chosen a method to get through to voters’ hearts,” said Putin. “He behaves extravagantly of course, we see this, but I think there’s a reason for this.” Putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the West that Russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the Middle East apart from Syria.    Such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that Russia posed, he said, in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance. He said Russia was not planning to attack anyone. But he made clear Russia was in Syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of Aleppo of what he called “a nest of terrorists”, while trying to minimise civilian casualties.

TRUMP IS REPORTEDLY Preparing Executive Order To Deport Illegals Living On Welfare…Kill Anchor Baby Benefits,"According to the Center for Immigration Studies, in 2012 approximately 51 percent of all immigrant households collected welfare: HOW THE USDA Helps Illegal Aliens Get FREE Benefits Paid For By YOU! This is a problem. A lot of American households also collect welfare, and that is a problem as well.A liberal newspaper claims it has obtained copies of two of President Donald Trump s upcoming executive orders that if implemented would once and for all stop immigrants from leeching off the American taxpayer.Obtained by The Washington Post, the orders would reportedly  deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge  and set up standards for  determining whether an alien is deportable   for having become a public charge within five years of entry. The underlying goal would be to make the U.S. immigration system more  merit-based,  so those with the potential to contribute to the country would be welcome, whereas those more likely to be a burden to the American taxpayer would be kept out.According to New York magazine, the order would also  bar undocumented immigrants from accessing the child tax credit, even when their children are U.S. citizens,  which would be a huge blow to illegal immigrant families hoping to cash in on their anchor babies.The simple fact is that as a sovereign nation, the United States reserves the right to demand the very best from anyone who aspires to live here. It is a fact that the U.S. actually has much more lenient immigration policies than a large number of Western countries that liberals profess to admire. Try immigrating to Canada or Western Europe if you don t believe it.If an immigrant works hard, obtains citizenship and leads a good life but is later laid off and needs to collect welfare for a bit, that s one thing. But when someone immigrates here and then immediately boards the welfare train, that is another   and it s a problem that President Trump hopes to finally resolve.For entire story: Conservative Tribune",left-news,"Feb 4, 2017",0,2104
 Russian Investigation Landing Very Close To Trump; Jared Kushner Now ‘Person Of Interest’,"While Donald Trump is on a whirlwind world tour, the Russian investigation is beginning to land uncomfortably close to home for Trump. A member of his own family, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is now reportedly a  person of interest. The Washington Post said a senior adviser to Mr Trump was among people investigators wanted to speak to. A New York magazine reporter then said the person in question was Mr Kushner, 36, who is married to Mr Trump s eldest daughter and who flew out of Washington on Friday night to accompany the President on his first official foreign trip.The Post said the person under investigation was close to the President, but did not identify them. However, the number of people who fit such a profile would be very small.Source: IndependentAnnnd another bomb: Russia probe sees a current Trump official as a  significant person of interest,  WaPo reports. https://t.co/mhFonUx1Wv pic.twitter.com/xjMPuELXVO  Daniel Dale (@ddale8) May 19, 2017WashPo reports:-person of interest is a  WH official  3 officials had confirmed Russia contact  1 of them works at WH, Jared Kushner  Ari Melber (@AriMelber) May 19, 2017Jared is the  person of interest  in the West Wing that the Feds are looking at.

No. While things have begun escalating rather quickly, The Washington Post reports that criminal charges are likely not near.Right now, all of this is speculative, but when you connect the dots, they connect right to Kushner. It could be that people behind the investigation believe that Kushner is vulnerable and likely to talk. We already know that he made a lie of omission on his security clearance application and  forgot  to mention a meeting with Russians. This makes him a fairly easy target in the investigation and as one of the few people to have the ear of Trump, he likely knows a lot about all of the Russian ties. He knows where all the bodies are buried, so to speak.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2017",0,2175

" ‘Affluenza Teen’ Transferred To Adult Court, Faces 10 Years In Prison","Looks like money can t protect you forever if you insist on being a lifelong asshole:A Texas judge on Friday ordered the case of Ethan Couch to be transferred to an adult court, meaning the teenager faces jail time for a 2013 drunken-driving crash that killed four people.The decision by the juvenile court in Fort Worth means that Mr. Couch will spend up to 120 days in jail, then finish his 10-year probation.So he s only getting a maximum 4 month slap on the wrist for violating his probation and fleeing the country. We normal people would be screwed if we tried that, but money still talks apparently. That s the bad news.Here s the good news:Samantha K. Jordan, a spokeswoman for the Tarrant County district attorney s office, said a hearing, which is scheduled for April, would set the conditions of Mr. Couch s probation. If he violated his probation, she said, he could get up to 10 years in prison. It means he will actually be under supervision until 2024,  Ms. Jordan said.  The penalties are tougher, but the way they maintain the supervision is stricter as well. Considering Couch is such a spoiled shit that his parents threw him a going away party after he was busted drinking when he was forbidden from doing so, there is almost no chance that he will be able to stick to his new probation. He ll get drunk again or skip a meeting with his probation officer or do something similarly stupid with the expectation of mummy and daddy taking care of it. But now that he s in the Big Boy justice system, it s very unlikely that the coddling will continue. One more slip up and justice will finally be served on Patient Zero of affluenza.None of this excuses the fact that he got away with the murder of 4 people solely because he was rich, but at least we can trust that his continued irresponsibility will see justice served.

Ex-Trump campaign chief Manafort wants probe of leaks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager,  lashed out on Tuesday at reports he was wiretapped by federal authorities, and his spokesman sent out a statement demanding a leaks probe and suggesting the surveillance was politically motivated. The statement issued by spokesman Jason Maloni on behalf of Manafort came a day after CNN reported that a secret court had authorized surveillance of Manafort under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), under which Americans can be targeted if they are suspected of acting as an agent of a foreign country. Manafort became Trump’s campaign manager in June 2016 but was forced to resign two months later amid reports of his business relationship with the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich. Manafort is being investigated as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The court initially authorized FISA surveillance of Manafort in 2014 but that lapsed in 2016 for lack of evidence, CNN reported. FISA surveillance resumed later in 2016 and continued into 2017 as part of the FBI’s probe into ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, CNN said. “If true, it is a felony to reveal the existence of a FISA warrant, regardless of the fact that no charges ever emerged,” Maloni said in the statement on behalf of Manafort. “The U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General should immediately conduct an investigation into these leaks and to examine the motivations behind a previous administration’s effort to surveil a political opponent,” he said. The special counsel’s office and the FBI both declined to comment on Maloni’s statement. They also did not comment on CNN’s original report about surveillance of Manafort. Maloni urged the Justice Department to release any intercepts between Manafort and any non-Americans so people “can come to the same conclusion as the DOJ (Justice Department) - there is nothing there.” As part of the special counsel’s probe, federal agents with search warrants raided Manafort’s Virginia home in July. The New York Times, citing two people close to the case, reported on Monday that prosecutors later told Manafort they planned to indict him. CNN said interest in Manafort deepened because of intercepted communications between him and Russian operatives, and among the Russians. The government eavesdropping continued into 2017, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to Trump after he became president.

The former First Lady managed to infuriate conservatives by doing some so terrible that they were forced to use words like  ghetto  and  trash  and  ape  to describe her (you know, their go-to language whenever a person with skin darker than a piece of classroom chalk is involved).What did she do that was so terrible? She went to Beyonce s birthday party last year.So, what set them off about this now?

Racist attacks  on the Obamas has become something of a sport with conservatives.

 Incompetent Trump WH Already F**king Up; Has To Adjust Their Muslim Ban (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is easily the most unprepared and incompetent person to ever be elected president. His most recent outrage of course is his immigration ban on those arriving in the United States from seven Muslim majority countries. That caused the nation and world to erupt in chaos, and people who were legal residents of the United States were turned away or deported   all because of their nations of origin. Now, realizing that they royally fucked up, Trump and his band of clowns are trying to hurriedly clean it up amid worldwide protests.On Sunday s edition of Meet the Press, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus decided that people who hold green cards and are perfectly safe and legal residents should be allowed to come home. He said to host Chuck Todd: If you re an American citizen travelling back and forth to Libya, you are likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come into an airport. There is discretionary authority that a custos and border patrol agent has when they suspect that someone is up to no good when they travel back and forth to Libya or Yemen. Make no mistake   this is the Muslim ban that Trump promised. The chaotic and dangerous happenings of Friday and Saturday are only the beginning. We could very well be headed for a repeat of what happened during the Holocaust, when The United States turned away boatloads of people who were fleeing Adolf Hitler s Nazi death camps. Most of those people went on to be brutally tortured and murdered   all because we were too protectionist and cold-hearted to help them flee for their lives.What Priebus said is nothing more than a smoke screen to make people think that what they are doing is for the good of the nation and its people. Make no mistake   it isn t. This is administration is nothing more than a coup, the first step in ushering in White Supremacy as an American value and matter of policy. The only saving grace is their gross incompetence, and their inability to hide what they are really doing from the public. In the meantime, we are all in terrible danger as a result of electing a completely unqualified madman as president. #RESIST.Featured image via G.

CNN political commentator Van Jones was also a guest on the Bill Maher show. Jones recently wrote a book about how if Democrats ever want to win another race, they need to find ways to reach common ground with Trump supporters.Bill Maher started out his interview with Joy Behar by complimenting her because she s one of the only Democrats to agree with him that Democrats are  too nice .  When he asked Behar how she felt about Michelle Obama s famous (and ridiculous) quotes at the DNC convention where she claimed that,  When they (Republicans) go low, we (Democrats) go high.  Behar then said,  No! When they go low we should go lower.  She then looked out at Van Jones and called him out,  Van, listen, you re the first perpetrator of this. He wants the kumbaya. F**k the kumbaya!   These people on this side are crazy. Dont  you understand? They re crazy! And then, quite hilariously, Behar told Jones  You don t deal with white supremacists!  And Behard does?Watch:When Joy Behar told Jones to  F**k your kumbaya , she was referring the CNN political commentator Van Jones  recent appearance on ABC s The View to discuss his new book. Joy Behar was barely able to contain herself when Jones talked about how leftist Democrats need to work to find common ground. Jones criticized fellow liberals for being  mad at every single person  who voted for President Donald Trump.Watch:",politics,"Oct 28, 2017",0,1795
 Republicans Despondent After Final Benghazi Report Finds NO EVIDENCE Hillary Clinton Wrongdoing,"When Republicans announced that they would be abruptly releasing the conclusions to their exhaustive, five-year Benghazi witch hunt this week, political strategists were stumped. Either this meant they had something explosive and wanted to unload it, or it meant they had absolutely nothing and wanted to bury the wasted energy, money and time spent on this anti-Hillary Clinton hit job long before the election rolled around.Upon releasing the document, it became instantly clear which option this was: Even after five years, the Republican-led Benghazi investigation found absolutely zero evidence that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. Nor did they find a single way Clinton could have saved any of the victims. In short, the investigation was a complete and total dud.As the New York Times summed up:Ending one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report on Tuesday, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead.Not that Republicans didn t try their hardest. The investigation cost a truly staggering $7 million and took years to conduct. At every turn, the evidence suggested Clinton was not irresponsible with her actions while Secretary of State, and at every turn that evidence was ignored in the hopes that there was a bombshell just around the corner.Also admitted to during the final report? President Obama didn t  lie  to the American people about what happened in Benghazi. That was right-wing spin.The investigations generally concluded that after the attack, the Obama administration s talking points   a matter of much dispute   were flawed but not deliberately misleading.The idea that President Obama would have all the information to accurately describe what was unfolding in Benghazi as it happened was preposterous. As someone once wryly remarked, George W. Bush spent years telling the American public that Iraq was responsible for 9/11, President Obama spent a few hours saying  we don t know  what happened in Benghazi. Hardly an impeachable offense.Nevertheless, Republicans   including Trump s campaign   have tried to make a lot of political noise based on these rumors. In a sick irony, Trump s own lawyer spent the same morning this report was released openly accusing Hillary Clinton of  murder  because of Benghazi.NBC/WSJ poll has @realDonaldTrump beating #CrookedHillary on #Honesty & #NationalSecurity. This picture says it all! pic.twitter.com/E9YKIgoqnV  Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) June 28, 2016Clinton was understandably relieved to have this nonsense put past her. Despite the lack of evidence, certain corners of the internet routinely cited Benghazi as a reason not to vote for her. That talking point has finally and comprehensively come undone. After more than two years and more than $7 million in taxpayer funds, the Committee report has not found anything to contradict the conclusions of the multiple, earlier investigations,  a spokesman for the Clinton campaign said in a statement.  This report just confirms what Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and even one of Trey Gowdy s own former staffers admitted months ago: this Committee s chief goal is to politicize the deaths of four brave Americans in order to try to attack the Obama administration and hurt Hillary Clinton s campaign. In many ways, this final white flag by Republicans represents the increasingly despondent way they are viewing the upcoming election. Their candidate is a belligerent, self-aggrandizing bigot that is currently losing by historic numbers in the polls. If the GOP had any shot at competing in this election with that guy, they needed something like Benghazi to derail Clinton. Instead, they were forced to admit there was nothing there.By releasing the report now, there is a clear sense that the Republican Party is hoping to dig their trenches, hunker down and wait out whatever comes next. The Benghazi investigation going down in flames isn t exactly a game-ender, but it s certainly not the game-changer they had hoped for either.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 28, 2016",0,4313

 Melissa McCarthy Just Took On Sean Spicer’s ‘Hitler Moment’ And It’s F*cking Perfect (VIDEO),"In case you were unaware, Sean Spicer has spent much of the week attempting to justify his claim that Adolf Hitler wasn t as bad of a guy as everyone says because he drove people to concentration camps   sorry,  Holocaust centers    rather than just gas them in town like Assad does. We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II,  Spicer, apparently under the impression that Passover needed a little bit of Holocaust denial from the White House press secretary, said Tuesday.  You know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons. I think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,  Spicer later said in an attempt to  clarify  his remarks, forgetting about all those gas chambers in what he calls  Holocaust centers  (or, of course, the mobile execution vans). Spicer continued to apologize throughout the week, but for some inexplicable reason found himself unable to undo the damage he did when he decided that Hitler wasn t such a bad guy after all.Spicer s Hitler week had all the makings of a perfect Saturday Night Live sketch, and Melissa McCarthy did not disappoint. Dressed as Spicer in his Easter Bunny costume (if you didn t know, he played the role of the egg-delivering Easter hero during the Bush years)McCarthy s Spicer admitted that he  finally made a mistake  with the Hitler gaffe.  Everybody was like  boo hoo, well what about the Holocaust centers?' Yeah, I know they re not really called  Holocaust centers    Duh, I know that. I m aware,   Spicer  added.  I clearly meant to say,  concentration clubs,  ok? Let it drop. It would be really great if the nitpickers could try and see the big picture and didn t focus on every little slur and lie I say,  Spicey said.  That d be nice. We won t ruin any more of it for you.

 Multiple Sclerosis Patient Montel Williams Rips GOP Health Care Bill To Pieces: ‘So Wrong’ (VIDEO),"Montel Williams, who has been fighting Multiple Sclerosis since 1999, ripped the GOP s hideous health care bill, and the Republicans who voted for it, to pieces.The American Health Care Act guts the protections for pre-existing conditions that Obamacare had provided. Under the AHCA, states could opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions as much as they want. This means that sick people, the very people who need medical care the most, could find themselves priced out of insurance coverage.Williams, who has been a vocal advocate for MS, weighed in on the bill during an interview with CNN on Saturday. When by asked by Ana Cabrera what he thought of the AHCA, Williams did not hold back.What people at home don t understand, when you say terms and things like pre-existing conditions, they really are basing this on what an insurance company has stated was a pre-existing condition.So, they think about 22 percent of Americans have a problem right this minute. This is from the National Institutes of Health. Over 56 percent of adult Americans, 120 million adult Americans, have one chronic illness. And around 80 percent of them have at least two.So these numbers that people throw out are so wrong.Cabrera pointed out that Republicans have promised  access  to health care, but what they really mean is that you can get insurance coverage if you are rich enough to pay for it. Williams said that he is lucky to be able to afford whatever health insurance he needs, but most Americans don t have that luxury.He went on to say that many MS patients are already unable to get the medications they need to control this debilitating neurological condition because they don t have insurance. Williams explained that the medication he himself is on costs over $1,500 a month. I also have MS, and the price tag for just one of my medications tops $100,000 a year.Williams says that we need to worry about lowering costs, not signing people s death warrants with heinous bills like the AHCA. He explains that the  normal American  can t afford to pay these kinds of prices for the medicines  that keep them alive. That s what insurance is for,  he added.Watch Montel tear the GOP health care bill to pieces, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 6, 2017",0,2413
DIGITAL TYRANNY: Google and Facebook’s Automated Censorship Program (I Hope You Can Speak Chinese),"21st Century Wire says Based on their own reports and public statements, it was clear that both Google and Facebook, and others, were engaged in formulating a wide program of censorship in order to  tackle  what the corporations deem as  offensive speech  or  hate speech . Although based on the political biases of members of these corporations, the actual administration of this will be done by fully hidden and unaccountable automated computer algorithms. According to new reports, the new methods are not merely the manipulation of metrics used to downplay content. These are incredibly clandestine and very sinister measures: without visibly shutting down an account, this new automated censorship process will simply make an account holder s posts invisible to their friends, fans and followers, in what Google/YouTube is calling  a limited state  in order to  isolate and contain  a targeted user   even if they have NOT violated the user terms of services. This is designed not only to  disappear  important opinions and information   but also to frustrate users, in the hopes that they will eventually abandon the platform as a viable content distribution network.We believe that Facebook may also be implementing similar restrictions on political speech. Mark Zuckerberg s admission to Angela Merkel that Facebook was working on eliminating  hate speech  was an early indicator, and undoubtedly the election of Donald Trump, and the subsequent scapegoating of  fake news  by Clinton supporters, has since pushed many  progressive  Silicon Valley executives over the edge. However, things may have advanced considerably since then. On August 5th, 21stCenturyWire.com Editor Patrick Henningsen had his personal Facebook newsfeed for 21WIRE articles  disappeared : UPDATE: Sunday afternoon GMT, it seems that the invisible admins at Facebook has (quietly) re-opened his profile s newsfeed which seems to be visible to some of my friends now, although yesterday s posts are still HIDDEN (you can see them by scrolling down his timeline). They did not respond to Henningsen s written complaint via customer service however   no surprise there, as they never have done before. The important aspect to focus on here is that these secretive measures are all part of a wider political agenda. With Silicon Valley corporations clearly determined to preside over an all-encompassing social media monopoly, such restrictive politicized policies become even more dangerous. The following story which broke yesterday details an apparent backlash from a Google employee against the company s  diversity policies  has gone internally viral at the company. This was reportedly filed by VICE magazine s tech section, Motherboard: The person who wrote the document argued that the representation gap between men and women in software engineering persists because of biological differences between the two sexes, according to public tweets from Google employees. It also said Google should not offer programs for underrepresented racial or gender minorities, according to one of the employees I spoke to. The 10-page Google Doc document was met with derision from a large majority of employees who saw and denounced its contents, according to the employee. But Jaana Dogan, a software engineer at Google, tweeted that some people at the company at least partially agreed with the author; one of our sources said the same. While the document itself contains the thoughts of just one Google employee, the context in which they were shared Google is currently being investigated by the Department of Labor for its gender pay gap and Silicon Valley has been repeatedly exposed as a place that discriminates against women and people of color as well as the private and public response from its workforce are important. See Gizmodo s review of the 10 page Google Doc.Listen to this incredible analysis by Mister Metokur exposing the highly unethical, discriminatory, collusive   and ultimately illegal practices which are being implemented by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media cartel platforms in order to erase political speech which they seek to suppress: SUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"August 6, 2017",0,4310
Republicans appear all but certain to pass tax legislation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress appeared all but certain to pass sweeping tax legislation this week after two Senate Republican holdouts agreed on Monday to support a tax overhaul backed by President Donald Trump.   As the Republicans’ self-imposed Friday voting deadline loomed, Senators Susan Collins and Mike Lee each said they had decided to back the legislation hammered out last week among Republicans from the Senate and House of Representatives.  “The first major overhaul of our tax code since 1986, this legislation will provide tax relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs right here in America and spur economic growth that will benefit all Americans,” Collins said on the floor of the Senate while announcing her support. The Maine Republican had been undecided on the legislation.  Lee had been similarly undecided until the Utah Republican tweeted earlier in the day that he would “proudly” vote for the bill.   The House of Representatives, which is also expected to adopt the bill, was due to vote first at around 1:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) on Tuesday, Republican aides said. The Senate vote is expected to follow either later on Tuesday or on Wednesday. “We will get it on the president’s desk for him to sign into law before Christmas, as we pledged,” predicted No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn, who said the Senate would begin 10 hours of debate after receiving the House-approved measure. White House officials said on Monday that Vice President Mike Pence, who would cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate if necessary, was delaying his trip to Egypt and Israel this week to be in Washington for the vote on the tax plan. “The tax vote is still in very good shape, but we don’t want to take any chances,” a White House official said. The package of tax cuts for businesses and individuals, if enacted, would overhaul the U.S. tax code for the first time in more than 30 years and give Republicans their first major legislative victory of Trump’s presidency. Republicans, who believe they must act to preserve their House and Senate majorities in next year’s congressional elections, insist the tax cuts will drive U.S. economic growth higher and create jobs. Democrats, who oppose it, describe the legislation as a giveaway to corporations and wealthy Americans that will add $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade while raising taxes on some middle-class taxpayers.   Lawmakers in the House, where Republicans hold a 239-193 seat majority, are expected to approve the legislation largely along party lines. A smattering of “no” votes is likely from Republican fiscal hawks and lawmakers from New York, New Jersey and California who oppose a provision that would scale back a popular deduction for state and local taxes.   Both the House and Senate must approve the measure before Trump can sign it into law. The 100-seat Senate, where Republicans have only a 52-48 majority, proved to be the graveyard for last summer’s Republican drive to overturn former Democratic President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, when three Republicans opposed the measure. The tax overhaul has also faced challenges. But the specter of failure appeared to lift on Monday, as Congress closed in on final votes. Senate Republicans can afford to lose no more than two votes if they intend to pass tax legislation, and they are already down one vote. Senator John McCain, who is undergoing treatment for brain cancer, will not be available to support the bill because he is spending time with family in Arizona.   With support from Collins and Lee, only Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona remained undecided. A fifth Republican, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, has missed votes for health reasons this year but was expected to be on hand to support the tax bill. Republican Senator Bob Corker, a fiscal hawk, voted against the initial Senate bill but has said he will support final legislation. ",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017 ",1,4017
"LOL! OBAMA WARNS VOTERS Donald Trump Is Unvetted, Unserious…”This is not a reality show”","Says the guy who was a Jr. Senator and Community Organizer prior to becoming President of the United States.   And who can forget our  selfie  President?And then there s the famous Nelson Mandela funeral selfie:President Obama skewered Donald Trump on Friday, warning that the Republicans  presumptive nominee isn t serious enough for the presidency, his plans aren t plausible, and his ideas haven t been vetted sufficiently.Let s not forget that when Obama was living in his own little narcissistic world and making a contribution to absolutely no-one Trump was busy creating jobs.Obama continued: He has a long record that needs to be examined. And I think it s important for us ot take seriously the statements he s made in the past,  Obama said.  We are in serious times and this is a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. These were Obama s first extended comments about Trump since the New York mogul cemented his role as the presumptive GOP nominee on Tuesday night. He spoke in the White House briefing room, using remarks on the economy and a crackdown on tax evasion as an opportunity to air his views. It was clear he expected questions about Trump, and intended to use the appearance to discuss the new phase of the election. This is a contest for the presidency of the United States and what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny,  he said.Via: Dallas Morning NewsSpeaking of  scrutiny :Here is a Breitbart News top ten list of things that Obama has refused to release (a complete list would fill volumes):10. State senate papers. In the 2008 primary, Obama criticized Hillary Clinton for not releasing papers from her eight years as First Lady but failed to produce any papers from his eight years in Springfield.  They could have been thrown out,  he said.9. Academic transcripts. His supposed academic brilliance was a major selling point, but Obama (by his own admission) was a mediocre student. His GPA at Occidental was a B-plus at best, and his entering class at Columbia was weak. Can he prove his merit?8. Book proposal. Obama s literary agent claimed he was  born in Kenya for sixteen years. His original book proposal exists biographer David Maraniss refers to it and seems to have embellished other key details of his life. Yet it has never been released.7. Medical records. In 2000, and again (briefly) in 2008, GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain released thousands of pages of his medical records. Obama, who had abused drugs and continued smoking, merely provided a one-page doctor s note.6. Small-dollar donors. In 2008, the McCain campaign released the names of donors who had contributed less than $200, though it was not required to do so. But the Obama campaign refused, amidst accusations it had accepted illegal foreign contributions.5. The Khalidi tape. In 2003, Obama attended a party for his good friend, the radical Palestinian academic Rashid Khalidi. The event featured incendiary anti-Israel rhetoric. The LA Times broke the story, but has refused to release the tape and so has Obama.4. The real White House guest list. Touting its transparency, the Obama White House released its guest logs but kept many visits secret, and moved meetings with lobbyists off-site. It also refused to confirm the identities of visitors like Bertha Lewis of ACORN.3. Countless FOIA requests. The Obama administration has been described as  the worst  ever in complying with Freedom of Information Act requests for documents. It has also punished whistleblowers like David Walpin, who exposed cronyism in Americorps.2. Health reform negotiations. Candidate Obama promised that health care reform negotiations would be televised on C-SPAN. Instead, there were back-room deals worth millions with lobbyists and legislators the details of which are only beginning to emerge.1. Fast and Furious documents. After months of stonewalling Congress, Attorney General Eric Holder asked President Obama to use executive privilege to conceal thousands of documents related to the deadly scandal and Obama did just that.In addition to the above, Obama and his campaign have lied about many facts about his past his membership in the New Party; his extensive connections with ACORN; and his continued relationship with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright, among other examples. Obama s own memoir is filled with fabrications. And now he is lying about his opponent s honorable record in business. He and the media have no shame.And oh yeah one more thing that we almost forgot:",left-news,"May 6, 2016",0,4711

Former U.S. Vice President Biden leaves open door to 2020 run,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Monday left the door open to a presidential run to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election and said he is focused now on boosting Democrats in the 2018 midterm races. Biden, who will turn 75 on Nov. 20, declined to seek the Democratic nomination for last year’s presidential election in the wake of his son’s death. He told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview that he was not yet ready to enter a political contest. “I honest to God haven’t made up my mind about that,” said Biden, who is promoting his memoir on Beau Biden, who died in 2015 from brain cancer. “Right now I want to focus on the book and I want to focus on winning the off-year elections. “I’m not closing the door,” said Biden, who added that he was in good health. But if he had to act right now, “I would say no because I am just working through a whole lot, I’m getting there and I want to focus on the book.” Biden served as vice president under Democratic former President Barack Obama for two terms but stood aside as the party nominated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump last year. Biden had sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 and 2008 elections. Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate for 36 years, has long given voice to the working class. Although he campaigned for Clinton, he also has been critical after the Democrats’ loss in 2016, which gave Republicans control of the White House in addition to their hold Congress. Biden has criticized Trump in recent weeks, saying he “does not understand governance” and did not take a strong stand against white supremacists after a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.

 Hot Mic Captures Humiliating Moment Trump Tells Christie To Leave Stage (VIDEO),"Thankfully, Chris Christie proved he was beyond shame when he endorsed Donald Trump for president, but this moment had to sting a little bit.In a humiliating moment for the one-time Republican presidential candidate, a hot mic captured the way Donald Trump treats his new lap dog   and it isn t pretty.At a rally, Christie seemed to think he would share the stage with Trump during Trump s portion of the event, but apparently the idea of sharing a spotlight with a former rival wasn t something Trump was about to let happen. Shaking Christie s hand, Trump leans in and whispers,  Get on the plane and go home. It s over there. Go home.  Christie at first continues waving, then simply says  Okay  and walks towards the exit.Here s the video:Whether Trump was trying to be nice by sparing Christie yet another stump speech is not clear, but what is clear is that Trump would much prefer it if his  friends  avoided trying to take too much of the attention away from him.It s probably a tough pill to swallow, but Christie must surely realize by now that by endorsing Trump, he doesn t get to share in the Republican front-runners spotlight. Viciously jealous, astoundingly egotistical, Trump has always been a one-man operation. He will share his fame with no one.Christie, of course, knows all of this. Months ago he was loudly suggesting that Trump was not presidential material.

Christie was saying this Bravado, by itself, is not a plan,  he said,  I like him, he s a good person, he s just not the right person to be President of the United States and not the person that we d want representing our country.

CLINTON FOUNDATION DONORS GOT SWEET WEAPONS DEALS FROM CLINTON’S STATE DEPARTMENT,"Nothing shady here, huh? Unbelievable!Even by the standards of arms deals between the United States and Saudi Arabia, this one was enormous. A consortium of American defense contractors led by Boeing would deliver $29 billion worth of advanced fighter jets to the United States  oil-rich ally in the Middle East.Israeli officials were agitated, reportedly complaining to the Obama administration that this substantial enhancement to Saudi air power risked disrupting the region s fragile balance of power. The deal appeared to collide with the State Department s documented concerns about the repressive policies of the Saudi royal family.But now, in late 2011, Hillary Clinton s State Department was formally clearing the sale, asserting that it was in the national interest. At a press conference in Washington to announce the department s approval, an assistant secretary of state, Andrew Shapiro, declared that the deal had been  a top priority  for Clinton personally. Shapiro, a longtime aide to Clinton since her Senate days, added that the  U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army have excellent relationships in Saudi Arabia. These were not the only relationships bridging leaders of the two nations. In the years before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributed at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, the philanthropic enterprise she has overseen with her husband, former president Bill Clinton. Just two months before the deal was finalized, Boeing   the defense contractor that manufactures one of the fighter jets the Saudis were especially keen to acquire, the F-15   contributed $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to a company press release.Via: IBT",politics,"May 26, 2015",0,1795
 Donald Trump Implies That He Wants The National Mall To Be Torn Up (VIDEO),"It s become abundantly clear that Donald Trump doesn t think through what he s saying, basically at any given moment. His mouth has no filter, and he says whatever is on his mind at any time without thinking about the consequences of his speech. And then when people call him on his obnoxious rhetoric, instead of backing down or clarifying, he owns the rhetoric and doubles down on it.Now, it yet another moment of being incapable of using critical thinking skills, Donald Trump compares the Rolling Thunder rally, which is pretty much all motorcycles, to Martin Luther King Jr. s march on Washington, and then he also wants the motorcycles to be able to drive all over the National Mall. He doesn t like that they re only able to drive on the streets. However, anyone with a thinking brain could tell you that we shouldn t destroy the National Mall and have it torn up with hundreds, if not thousands, of motorcycles.If Trump sincerely means all the things that he says then we ve got a pretty big problem on our hands if he actually becomes president. So, for the sake of all that is good and decent in humanity, no matter who, vote blue.Watch here:WATCH: @realDonaldTrump says he thought Rolling Thunder rally in D.C. would be like MLK s March on Washington:https://t.co/9HuaDSawUx  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 29, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 29, 2016",0,1446
 WATCH: Top Trump Aide Admits He Sees The Presidency As ‘The Ultimate Reality Show’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a reality television star and we ve heard from numerous people, including President Obama himself, that this is not a reality show like he thinks. Jeb Bush repeatedly hammered Trump for not being a serious candidate. Enter his top strategist, Paul Manafort, who spoke to Chris Matthews on MSBNC Tuesday night, where he directly reinforced the serious joke that is Donald Trump and his campaign.Manafort and Matthews were discussing just how exciting the GOP convention will be. Manafort insisted that, since Trump is already a TV star, he understands the media, and he can make the convention and everything else very entertaining. It s just absolutely, fantastically frightening that we have a candidate with a strategist who thinks this is all just entertainment.The kicker in this interview came when Matthews and Manafort got into this exchange:MATTHEWS:  You re going to have to break some eggs, though, right? MANAFORT:  I don t think we have to break any eggs. MATTHEWS:  Reince Priebus is going to give us an exciting convention? Come on! MANFORT:  Donald Trump is going to give you an exciting convention. MATTHEWS:  Okay, how? Do you have some movies or- MANAFORT:  We re going to have a program put together, it s not put together yet- MATTHEWS:  A reality show of some kind? MANAFORT:  Well, this is the ultimate reality show, the presidency of the United States. This made us facepalm our eyeballs into the backs of our heads. Watch the whole bizarre exchange below:So there it is. Manafort himself admitted that the Presidency of the United States is, in his view and probably Trump s view, a reality show.

"Bus plunges into river in Nepal, killing at least 31","KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A bus carrying passengers returning from a Hindu festival to the Nepali capital of Kathmandu skidded off the main highway and plunged into a river on Saturday, killing at least 31 people and leaving others trapped, officials said. The accident occurred around dawn, around 50 km (30 miles) west of the city on the Prithvi Highway that connects Kathmandu with the southern plains.  We have recovered 31 bodies and are looking for more,  government official Ram Mani Mishra told Reuters from the scene.  It s highly unlikely for anyone to survive for so long under water.  Rescuers on rubber boats and police divers managed to spot the bus hours after the crash and were trying to lift it from water with the help of a crane, Mishra said.     Apart from the deaths, 16 people have been injured, government administrator Shyam Prasad Bhandari said. Two with grave injuries were taken to Kathmandu while the rest were treated at a local hospital, he said. Police said survivors were thrown out of the bus windows but another 13 people were still believed to be trapped in the bus. The bus had left Rajbiraj town in the southeastern plains on Friday night. Road accidents are common in mostly mountainous Nepal, where police say about 1,800 people die in crashes every year. Accidents are also blamed on poorly maintained and crowded vehicles.

Connecticut governor eyes economic investments amid fiscal crisis,"HARTFORD (Reuters) - Connecticut, one of the wealthiest states in the nation, also has some of the highest debt levels and its capital city of Hartford is facing potential bankruptcy. Now, the state faces a fiscal crisis. A budget is nearly two months late, with debt and big pension liabilities - fixed costs that constrain spending - hampering lawmakers’ attempts to reach an agreement. Governor Dannel Malloy, a second-term Democrat who is not seeking reelection, discussed with Reuters tough decisions he has wrestled with to address a fiscal calamity decades in the making. Malloy and Ben Barnes, secretary of the State Office of Policy and Management, talked about the state’s debt burden and whether Connecticut would approve a possible bankruptcy filing for Hartford.  Below are excerpts from the interview. Q: Describe the fiscal health of the state, and whether a budget would be passed soon.  MALLOY: “There has been an ongoing process of making hard decisions. I think there’s some legislative fatigue over that, but we’ll get a budget. I’m pretty proud that Connecticut’s government is over 12 percent smaller today than when I took office. I’m proud that we’re the first administration to truly actuarially fund pensions. I’m proud that we’re the administration that has now restructured our arrangement with labor and have restructured the funding formula for our long-term obligations.”  Q: Could you characterize the state’s relationship with debt? BARNES: “There was a lot of school construction approved in the period running up to 2008 and the financial meltdown. We’ve been bonding for large projects which were approved before the bottom fell out. What we’ve added into the mix has been significant expansion of what we provide for higher education. And we’ve also put money into economic development initiatives, which we think are extremely important.” Q: If revenues are not coming in as expected, are tougher decisions needed regarding state borrowing?  MALLOY: “You make investments in growing the economy, (like) the University of Connecticut campus.”  BARNES: “The fiscal problems that we have today are entirely driven by the overhang of unfunded pension liability. The increases that we’ve made in payments for retiree health and unfunded pension liability since 2010 are equivalent to all the taxes we’ve raised and then some.”  Q: Should the school construction program be reevaluated? BARNES: “We have made some significant changes... The number of school construction projects that are going forward is down. We’ve definitely tightened the screws there, but the state of Connecticut has built a lot of schools over the last 20 years.” Q: Would you approve a bankruptcy filing for Hartford? MALLOY: “I would approve it if it’s the best way to handle their difficulties. Connecticut has not treated its cities very well, something which I’ve tried to change.” ",politicsNews,"August 23, 2017 ",1,2958

Afghans who helped U.S. forces may get more visas under defense bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved 4,000 more visas for Afghans who worked for U.S. forces as interpreters or support staff on Wednesday, an effort to preserve a program that had been at risk of shutting down. The committee included the additional visas in its version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a must-pass piece of legislation that sets priorities for the Department of Defense budget for fiscal 2018, which will be about $650 billion. The Senate and House of Representatives are currently working on separate versions of the legislation, which must be reconciled and passed by both chambers and signed by President Donald Trump before it can become law. The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program allows Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, often risking their lives, to move to the United States after a rigorous vetting process. Bipartisan pushes by U.S. lawmakers this year for more SIV visas have come against the backdrop of efforts by the Trump administration to clamp down on immigration from majority-Muslim countries. In March, the U.S. embassy in Kabul said it had stopped scheduling interviews for SIV applicants because it had nearly run out of visas, but lawmakers included 2,500 more in a  spending bill in April to preserve the program. “Our nation owes a great debt to the civilians who have provided essential assistance to the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, and I am very pleased that this legislation authorizes the necessary visas for these brave men and women,” said Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led the push for the legislation with Republican Senator John McCain, the Armed Services Committee’s chairman.

"Indian journalists, activists protest murder of newspaper publisher","BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Indian journalists and rights activists protested on Wednesday against the murder of an outspoken publisher of a weekly tabloid amid growing concerns about freedom of the press at a time of rising nationalism and intolerance of dissent. Gauri Lankesh, 55, the editor and publisher of the Kannada-language  Gauri Lankesh Patrike  newspaper, was shot dead on Tuesday by unidentified assailants near her home in the southern city of Bengaluru.  She had parked her car outside her gate and was walking to the main entrance of her home when the attackers fired at least seven rounds, killing her, police said. The motive was not known. Lankesh was a fierce advocate of secularism and opposed hardline Hindu groups associated with Prime Narendra Modi s right-wing, nationalist ruling party. Her weekly, with a circulation of more than 5,000, is regarded as influential in the state, read by policy makers and politicians.  Lankesh spent decades with various media outlets before taking over the newspaper started by her father. Several journalist groups, including the Editors  Guild, Press Club of India and Press Association, held protests in cities across India, calling her murder a  brutal assault on the freedom of the press .  They said she was a critical, secular voice at a time when the country was being swept by a wave of right-wing, Hindu nationalism.   She was an idealist and would take on the right-wing forces on several controversial issues,  said Y.P. Rajesh, an executive editor at the news website The Print and a long-time friend of Lankesh. The U.S. embassy in New Delhi also condemned the killing. The murder is a new low in India s recent record of protecting journalists.  The Committee to Protect Journalists has said that there have been no convictions in any of the 27 cases of journalists murdered in India because of their work since 1992. This year, the country of 1.3 billion people slipped three places to 136th in the World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders. The group said Hindu nationalists, on the rise since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power in 2014, were  trying to purge all manifestations of anti-national thought . Journalists seen to be critical of Hindu nationalists are often insulted on social media, and some women reporters have been threatened with assault.  People, including BJP members, have also openly insulted journalists, using terms like  presstitute  - a combination press and prostitute - to berate them. In recent weeks, Lankesh had posted videos on her Facebook page that were critical of Modi s economic policies and the rise of hardline Hindu groups since he came to power. Last year, she was sentenced to six months in jail after a defamation case was filed by a BJP member. She was released on bail. Ananth Kumar, a federal minister in the Modi government, said the state government must arrest those behind the killing. The state government in Karnataka, run by the Congress party, said it had set up a special investigations team to investigate  and police were examining CCTV footage. M.N. Anucheth, a senior police official investigating the case, said Lankesh was shot in the head, neck and chest.  This is an attempt to silence all of us   all of those who believe in democracy and decency,  Ramchandra Guha, a historian told the Indian Express newspaper.

Planned Parenthood sues Indiana for abortion law,"(Reuters) - Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana, saying a new state law restricting abortion was unconstitutional. The law, which was signed last month by Indiana Governor Mike Pence and goes into effect on July 1, prohibits abortion in the early stages of a pregnancy based on genetic abnormalities and mandates a fetus be buried or cremated, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court. Planned Parenthood asked for an injunction on the law, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the nonprofit organization’s  Indiana chapter. “The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed that a woman, not the state, is to determine whether or not to obtain an abortion,” Ken Falk, legal director for ACLU of Indiana, said in a statement. “The state of Indiana’s attempt to invade a woman’s privacy and to control her decision in this regard is unprecedented and unconstitutional.” The lawsuit named the Indiana State Department of Health, prosecutors of several counties and the state medical licensing board.  A spokeswoman for the health department referred all questions to the attorney general’s office, where no one could be reached for comment. A spokesman for the medical licensing board declined to comment about the lawsuit. Pence’s press secretary, Kara Brooks, said the governor is confident the law is constitutional. “We will work with the attorney general to defend the law that enhances information expectant mothers receive and enhances protection for the unborn,” she said. Indiana was the second U.S. state to prohibit abortions based on a prenatal diagnosis of disabilities such as Down syndrome, following North Dakota.  Planned Parenthood does not ask patients to disclose why they are obtaining an abortion, but under the new law, doctors would be mandated to report if a fetal anomaly was present before the abortion.  The new Indiana law would put physicians at risk for legal woes, and require additional costs for a fetus to be buried or cremated, according to the lawsuit. “Gov. Mike Pence isn’t a woman and he isn’t a doctor. He needs to get out and stay out of our doctors’ offices,” Betty Cockrum, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, said in a statement.  ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1,2389
OBAMA WILL GIVE AWAY FREE INTERNET (To Those He Deems Worthy) : “The internet is not a luxury”,"Don t turn off your paid internet service quite yet. If you have a job and contribute to our tax base, you won t qualify. You also have to be living in cities the Obama regime considers worthy of free internet service. Those cities have likely provided some form of support for Obama s radical agenda for America.Because internet service is a human right or something like that Calling the Internet a 21st century necessity, President Barack Obama on Wednesday unveiled a program to bring faster Internet connections to more low-income households, particularly to help students living in public and assisted housing stay ahead in school.Under ConnectHome, the public, private and nonprofit sectors have pledged to work together to provide high-speed connections and digital devices to more families at lower cost.More than 90 percent of households headed by a college graduate have Internet access, Obama said. But fewer than half of low-income households have similar access.In this day and age, Obama said the  digital divide  puts these individuals at a disadvantage by limiting their educational and economic opportunities because the Internet is increasingly needed to find a job, finish homework or keep in touch with family and friends. In this digital age, when you can apply for a job, take a course, pay your bills   with a tap of your phone, the Internet is not a luxury. It s a necessity,  Obama said in Durant, Oklahoma, on the first day of a two-day visit to the state. You cannot connect with today s economy without having access to the Internet,  he said.ConnectHome is similar to ConnectEd, a federal program that Obama said is on track to wire 99 percent of K-12 classrooms and libraries with high-speed Internet by the end of 2017.ConnectHome will begin in 27 cities and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, which is headquartered in Durant. With about 200,000 members spread across much of southeastern Oklahoma, the Choctaw Nation is the nation s third-largest Native American tribe.The Choctaw Nation was also among the administration s first  Promise Zones,  a designation that makes it eligible for tax incentives and grants to help fight poverty.The only federal money expected to be spent on ConnectHome is a $50,000 Agriculture Department grant to the Choctaw Nation, officials said.The 27 cities the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development selected for ConnectHome are: Albany, Georgia; Atlanta; Baltimore; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Boston; Camden, New Jersey; Cleveland; Denver; Durham, North Carolina; Fresno, California; Kansas City, Missouri; Little Rock, Arkansas; Los Angeles; Macon, Georgia; Memphis, Tennessee; Meriden, Connecticut; Nashville, Tennessee; New Orleans; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia; Rockford, Illinois; San Antonio; Seattle; Springfield, Massachusetts; Tampa, Florida; and the District of Columbia.Obama was spending the night in Oklahoma and on Thursday continuing a weeklong focus on making the criminal justice system fairer.He planned to meet Thursday with law enforcement officials and inmates during a historic tour of the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution, a medium-security facility west of Oklahoma City that holds about 1,300 male offenders.  I will be the first sitting president to visit a federal prison,  Obama said in a speech Tuesday to the NAACP meeting in Philadelphia.",politics,"Jul 16, 2015",0,3456

U.S. justices weigh federal fraud claim over woman's death,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday struggled with the question of when federal contractors can be sued for defrauding the government in a case involving a 19-year-old Massachusetts woman who suffered a fatal 2009 seizure at a mental health facility. The parents of Yarushka Rivera claimed that Universal Health Services Inc, which owned the facility, provided “gravely inadequate treatment” and used “unsupervised and unqualified personnel.” Their lawsuit said King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services, one of the nation’s largest hospital operators, defrauded the government because it was receiving federal Medicaid funding to provide treatment to low-income people and failed to comply with all necessary requirements. Rivera died in October 2009 of a seizure after being treated at the mental health center in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Julio Escobar and his wife, Carmen Correa, filed suit against Universal Health Services in U.S. District Court in Boston in 2011. They said they had received information that more than 20 treatment providers at the Lawrence facility, including a nurse who prescribed medication to Rivera, were not properly licensed or supervised as required by state law and federal regulations.  The parents sued under the False Claims Act, which allows individuals to make claims that the federal government has been defrauded.  During the one-hour oral argument, liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan signaled support for the parents’ fraud claims. Sotomayor said billing for services that were not carried out in full was like a government contractor providing the military “guns that don’t shoot.” Kagan similarly questioned whether the claim against Universal Health Services was any different than a failure by a federal contractor to provide the military boots that can be worn and food that can be eaten. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts appeared more hostile to the fraud claim, saying companies should not necessarily be liable for fraud just because they do not follow every procedure. “That causes concern, of course, because there are thousands of pages of regulations under Medicaid or Medicare programs,”  Roberts said. Medicare provides healthcare assistance to the elderly. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2014. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it in March 2015. Universal Health Services then appealed, asking the Supreme Court to resolve what kind of lawsuits can be brought under the False Claims Act. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed briefs backing the company, saying fraud claims should be allowed only when they involve specific violations of the terms of a contract with the government and not violations of other regulations.

Mexico accepts Israeli offer to help develop Central America,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Thursday that his country had accepted Israel s offer to help it and the United States develop Central America, as Israel and Mexico seek to deepen business ties. Speaking at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pena Nieto added that the two nations had agreed to update their free trade agreement, which was signed in 2000.  We have agreed to establish and begin the ... negotiations to look over this agreement so that the commercial relationship between both nations intensifies and grows,  he said. Netanyahu was joined by a business delegation including representatives from communications firm AudioCodes Ltd, cyber security firm Verint Systems Inc and Mer Group, which specializes in telecommunications and cyber security. In Central America, Pena Nieto said Israel s assistance could bolster the United States and Mexico s efforts in the region, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. He noted that Israel brings experience from carrying out development projects in Africa. The United States and Mexico have been seeking to encourage investment in infrastructure improvements in Central America s so-called Northern Triangle in an effort to stem migration to the United States. Netanyahu s trip marked the first visit to Mexico by a sitting Israeli prime minister, Pena Nieto said. At the close of the news conference, Netanyahu invited Pena Nieto to Jerusalem. The relationship between the nations was strained earlier this year by a tweet in which Netanyahu appeared to praise U.S. President Donald Trump s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin later issued a statement apologizing for any misunderstanding. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1,1828

 WATCH: Trump Gets His Deplorable A** Handed To Him By Keith Olbermann,"Hillary Clinton was wrong to say that half of Donald Trump s supporters are deplorable. Because it s more like 100 percent, says Keith Olbermann.As you may already know, the former MSNBC host is back with a brand new gig just in time for the election and he is not holding back.On Thursday, GQ s special political correspondent laid on the smack down on the Republican nominee for whining about Hillary s remark while simultaneously wearing it like a badge of honor.Beginning by noting how Mike Pence refuses to even call racist Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke a deplorable person, Olbermann soon mocked Trump for deciding that he should release his medical records to Dr. Oz  because Doctor Who is not filming locally. Of course, Trump chickened out at the last minute and decided not to release his records.Getting back to Trump s deplorables, Olbermann mentioned the pair of violent episodes seen at Trump rallies recently, one in which a Trump supporter grabbed a man by his neck and punched him and another in which a Trump supporter decked a 69-year-old woman and sent her crashing into her oxygen tank.Olbermann pointed out that it s still a kinder and gentler crowd because Trump s supporters  aren t all wearing the same colored shirts yet. Olbermann then went through Hillary s list of Trump s deplorable supporters, which includes racists, sexists, homophobes, Islamophobes, and xenophobes. He named names like Carl Paladino and Robert Jeffress and aired what they have said about black people, gays, and Muslims. These are campaign leaders, surrogates, friends of Mr. Trump,  Olbermann said.  If they re not talking to a basket full of deplorables, who are they talking to? Why would you have them there? You say stuff like that at work, you get fired. But Trump welcomes those who hate and is just fine with them spewing their hate out loud.In the end, Olbermann slammed every Trump supporter, including those who are not racist, sexist, etc If you support Trump. If you think he should be president regardless of how much he and his advocates hate and mock and punch old women with portable oxygen canisters. If you re not condemning this madness and repudiating these deplorable people and you are not racist, not sexist, not homophobic, not xenophobic, or not Islamophobic. If you re supporting him not for those things but in spite of them, you are even more deplorable. The correct number, Secretary Clinton, is not 50 percent, it s 100.

Obama torches Trump at his final Washington correspondents' dinner,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday took aim at Democrats and Republicans alike in his final appearance headlining the star-studded White House correspondents’ dinner, but saved his sharpest barbs for Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. “The Republican establishment is incredulous that he’s their most likely nominee,” Obama told attendees at the black-tie event, which brought together journalists and media moguls with Hollywood stars and power brokers from Capitol Hill and beyond. “They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But in fairness he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan,” the president said to howls of laughter, referring to contestants on the Miss Universe pageant that Trump formerly co-owned. Obama made fun of the angst many in the Republican establishment have expressed at the prospect that Trump or Tea Party candidate Ted Cruz could win the party’s nomination to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election. “Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instead a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan,” Obama said, referring to the top Republican in the House of Representatives, who many have hoped could be lured into running for president. “That’s not an option people,” Obama said, displaying comedic chops perfected through seven previous appearances at the annual dinner. “You may not like steak or fish, but that’s your choice.” In his remarks, Obama looked back on his presidency and jokingly predicted the country may be nearing its doom. “The end of the republic has never looked better,” the tuxedo-clad president said looking out at the well-groomed crowd as he blasted Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus. “Congratulations on all your success,” Obama told Priebus, while wearing a sarcastic grin. “The Republican party, the nomination process – it’s all going great.” Larry Wilmore, the host of a show on cable outlet Comedy Central, took his own shots at Trump when he took the podium after Obama, joking that next year the dinner will be called: “Donald Trump presents a luxurious evening paid for by Mexico.” Trump has famously promised to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to prevent illegal immigration, and he has said he would force Mexico to pay for it. With a bit of nostalgia, Obama reflected on his more than seven years in office, saying he had been a young man of idealism and vigor before he became president. “Eight years ago I said it was time to change the tone of our politics,” Obama said. “In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific.” ",politicsNews,"April 30, 2016 ",1,2746
Trump Jr.'s Russia emails could trigger probe under election law,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who had incriminating information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that could help his father’s presidential campaign could lead investigators to probe whether he violated U.S. election law, experts said.  Trump Jr. met the woman, lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, on June 9, 2016, after an email exchange with an intermediary.  The emails, tweeted by Trump Jr. on Tuesday, could provide material for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.  In one of the emails dated June 3, 2016, Trump Jr. wrote: “If it’s what you say I love it.” He released the tweets after the New York Times said it planned to write about their contents and sought his comment. Trump Jr. said in his tweets that nothing came of the meeting. Veselnitskaya told NBC News early on Tuesday she was not affiliated with the Russian government and had passed no information.  “In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,” Trump Jr. said in an interview on Fox News. “For me, this was opposition research.” Collusion itself is not an actual crime under the U.S. criminal code, so prosecutors would look to see if Trump Jr.’s conduct ran afoul of a specific law, legal experts said. Moscow has denied interference in the U.S. election, and President Donald Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia. Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.’s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.  One law that might come into play is the Federal Election Campaign Act, which makes it illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. The campaign is also prohibited from soliciting such contributions. A contribution does not have to be monetary in nature, according to Paul S. Ryan, an attorney with watchdog group Common Cause. He said incriminating information about Clinton could be considered a contribution under the act. Ryan said Trump Jr.’s “enthusiastic response” to the offer for information and particularly his proposal in his email to have a follow-up call the next week constituted “solicitation.”  “That to me is an indication, a concession by Donald Trump Jr. that he wants and is requesting this information,” Ryan said.  Joshua Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, said Trump Jr.’s emails made it “more plausible” that there could be a criminal case against him. James Gardner, an election law expert at the University of Buffalo Law School, said the election law was intended to target donations of cash or goods and services. He said he did not believe Trump Jr. would have violated the law if he solicited damaging information about Clinton.  A federal law known as the general conspiracy statute that makes it illegal to conspire to commit a crime against or defraud the United States could also come into play if, for example, Trump Jr. tried to help Russians hack into U.S. computer networks. There was no indication that Trump Jr. did such a thing. Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School who was  associate counsel in the White House Counsel’s Office under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said he thought Trump Jr.’s agreeing to meet with someone to discuss an illegal act would be enough to trigger a conspiracy charge.  “It’s a very powerful tool,” he said.

Bipartisan U.S. House members vow to keep gun control fight alive,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Friday pledged to build support in the U.S. House of Representatives for legislation keeping firearms from people on terrorism watch lists, despite repeated gun control failures this week in Congress. The “Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act” was introduced by nine House members representing diverse states stretching from Hawaii to Delaware, including some who have led the gun control fight for years. “If you can’t get on a plane because of the danger that may pose, there is no reason you should be able to purchase a dangerous weapon,” said Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, in a refrain that has ricocheted through the U.S. Capitol since the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando. The legislation, identical to a bill by Senator Susan Collins of Maine that was debated on the Senate floor on Thursday, would halt sales of weapons to people on a “no-fly” list barring them from boarding airplanes, or a “Selectee” list in which they are subjected to special airport screenings. Over the past two weeks, the Senate failed to advance this or several other proposals placing new constraints on gun sales, as the U.S. mourned the deaths of 49 people killed at an Orlando nightclub with 53 others injured. Curbelo said he met with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s top aide to inform him of the bill. The lawmaker left that meeting with no assurances it would advance, but simply “no objection from the speaker’s office” to the legislation being introduced, Curbelo said. He added that the bill’s sponsors now must build support “amongst our colleagues” in a House that has a concentration of conservative Republicans opposed to most gun control ideas. Many Republicans have argued that travelers can mistakenly be placed on terrorism watch lists and denying them the ability to buy weapons would stomp on their constitutional rights. “We cannot let that argument stop, into perpetuity, our ability to advance wise legislation in this matter,” countered    Republican Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia. Rigell, a co-sponsor of the bill, introduced himself to reporters at a press conference as a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, which lobbies against gun controls,  and an owner of 10 firearms, including an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that is similar to the weapon used by Omar Mateen, the Orlando shooter.

Gorbachev sees Russian democracy far off: biographer Taubman,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, celebrated in the West for championing democracy and helping end the Cold War, sees little chance Russia will turn from czarist-reminiscent, strongman government anytime in coming decades, the U.S. author of a new biography said on Monday. Pulitzer Prize-winning William Taubman interviewed Gorbachev, now 86, eight times for his  Gorbachev: His Life and Times  and said in the Reuters Global Markets Forum online chat room that Gorbachev was widely disliked in Russia. Here are edited excerpts: Question: How do Russians now see Gorbachev, who was popular in the 1980s? Answer: He is widely despised in Russia. People blame him for the collapse of the USSR, loss of its empire, the economic crash that accompanied the collapse, and also for seeming to be (to them, at any rate) a weak, indecisive leader. Q: Why does Russian President Vladimir Putin ignore Gorbachev, even as he memorializes much Russian history? A: Putin has only gained by ignoring or criticizing Gorbachev. In many ways, Putin s program is the opposite of Gorbachev s. It is as if Gorbachev has bequeathed the program, namely, the reverse of his own. As for Russia s dissatisfaction today, it is apparently growing as economic conditions worsen. But Putin has rallied support by annexing the Crimea, by depicting the West as Russia s enemy, by invoking the old czarist Trinity of principles: autocracy, nationality, and Orthodox religion. Q: Does Gorbachev have much hope of seeing a more democratic government? A: Gorbachev himself says it might take decades to democratize Russia,  even the whole 21st century.  This from a man who had hoped to see democracy come to the USSR in a few short years. Q: Is Gorbachev content in his late life? A: He insists he is. But I can t imagine he really is. His innate optimism may sustain him. But in addition to all the political attacks on him that continue, he now lives largely alone (except for bodyguards, chefs and chauffeurs) in a big house in the suburbs.

 Tim Kaine Shows Trump DECENT Way To Respond After His Shameful Dwyane Wade Tweet (VIDEO),"Senator Tim Kaine (D   VA) , Hillary Clinton s running mate, made a heartfelt response to the recent shooting death of NBA star Dwyane Wade s cousin, Nykea Aldridge. He told reporters that leaders should  ought to be extending our sympathy to the family  as the  only reaction that s appropriate,  while also expressing sadness about  this gun violence issue.

Trump responded to the murder:   Dwayne Wade s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP! Millions of people saw the tweet and hundreds responded to its crass exploitation of the death and for its ham-fisted messaging towards African-Americans.Wade issued a series of tweets after Trump s stumble, pointing out the need to curb gun violence, especially in cities like Chicago, where his cousin lived. Trump has been endorsed by the Natonal Rifle Association (NRA), who has fought tooth and nail against any and all efforts to reduce gun violence, especially background checks and limits on gun magazine sizes. The NRA has already committed several million dollars towards electing Trump president this year.RIP Nykea Aldridge  #EnoughIsEnough  DWade (@DwyaneWade) August 27, 2016The city of Chicago is hurting.

But in reality Trump has been on a tear, insulting blacks by painting a picture of their lives as hopeless, jobless, and living exclusively in the inner cities. Many blacks have spoken out against the portrait that Trump has been painting in front of almost totally white audiences in several states.Polling currently indicates that despite President Obama not being on the ballot in November, Trump could possibly attract even less black votes than Mitt Romney and John McCain.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 27, 2016",0,2575
"GUT WRENCHING: OBAMA Meets With Rappers To Discuss Criminal Justice Reform…Doublespeak For Pardoning Criminals, Investigating Cops","Is there any question what Obama s priorities are in his final 8 1/2 months in office? His legacy will most certainly be that of the most divisive President (and First Lady) to ever occupy the White House. Every law enforcement officer in America should be concerned about his obsession with taking them down a few notches.President Obama is meeting with a group of music stars on Friday to discuss his push for criminal justice reform and his initiaitve dedicated to helping young men and boys of color.Rappers Busta Rhymes, Common, J. Cole, Wale, Ludacris and Chance the Rapper are all attending the meeting, according to a senior administration official.The meeting comes as Obama is trying to beef up support for the My Brother s Keeper Initiative, which is designed to help young African-Americans get an education, college degree and job training.Obama and his supporters launched a nonprofit group last May that will allow the president to continue the work once he leaves office.The president has also tried to keep momentum behind a bipartisan coalition looking to pass legislation in Congress that would reduce prison sentences for many non-violent drug offenders. Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and My Brother s Keeper task force chairman Broderick Johnson also attended the meeting.War On Cops: President Obama says his  criminal justice reform    doublespeak for pardoning criminals and investigating cops   is gaining bipartisan support. New FBI crime data should stop the movement in its tracks.Last fall, we argued that Obama s war on police, prosecuted with the help of his Black Lives Matter goons, sparked a  national crime wave.   Violent criminals are getting the upper hand as the  Ferguson effect  takes hold in cities across the country,  we noted.  Less-aggressive policing has emboldened the bad guys, leading to a nationwide spike in murder. Officers fear violating softer new use-of-force and arrest policies, pushed on cities by the Obama Justice Department, will open them up to civil-rights prosecution. Many have backed off patrols and stops in dangerous urban areas as a result. The result: Year-over-year homicide rates are up 76% in Milwaukee; 60% in St. Louis; 56% in Baltimore; 44% in Washington, D.C.; 22% in New Orleans; 20% in Chicago; 20% in Kansas City; and 17% in Dallas. Single-digit rises have been seen in New York and other cities. Soon after, FBI Director James Comey indicated that spiking murder rates may be partly due to the  Ferguson effect    police reluctance to carry out their duties over fear of being investigated for abuse or discrimination, or shot by angry thugs in the line of duty.Police chiefs echoed his concerns, prompting the attorney general to gather major police chiefs and mayors together in Washington for a crime summit. It was supposed to be a closed meeting, no press allowed.But a Washington Post reporter snuck in and recorded Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel complaining that all the vitriol thrown at cops had put them in a  fetal  position. Obama s former chief of staff said they were backing off crime in gang-infested areas of his city.Obama pooh-poohed the city-by-city reports of climbing murder rates, arguing that there wasn t any aggregate data to show a national trend. But now we have the national data from the FBI. It confirms that the U.S. murder rate shot up 6.2% in the first half of 2015 from a year earlier. The spike reverses a three-year downtrend.Overall violent crime   murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault   rose almost 2%, in contrast to a nearly 5% drop in the comparable period of 2014. Violent crime rose in all but one of the nation s four regions, the FBI said, and all but two city groupings.If liberal pundits and politicians want to stop soaring crime rates, they should stop vilifying cops. And they should start speaking out against the Black Lives Matter race-mongers and their  criminal-justice reforming  patrons in the White House. ",politics,"Apr 15, 2016",0,4079
IT BEGINS: KAMIKAZE DRONE Equipped With Bomb To Be Set Off By Remote Detonator Found In Stolen Truck…Could Be Used For Terror Attacks Against U.S. Targets,"This is a truly disturbing discovery and an unimaginable threat that needs to be taken very seriously by our government Mexican police discovered four men carting a kamikaze drone equipped with an IED and a remote detonator last week, in what analysts say is an example of cartels figuring out how to weaponizing UAVs.The disturbing development is a manifestation of something top American security chiefs warned Congress about earlier this year, when they said they feared terrorists would begin to use drones to attack targets within the U.S.Drug cartels had already been turning to drones to smuggle their product into the U.S., and had begun using IEDs in their turf struggles   but now at least cartel appears to have put the two technologies together, according to Mexican reports analyzed by Small Wars Journal. A weaponized drone/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)/unmanned aerial system (UAS) with a remotely detonated IED allows for a precision strike to take place against an intended target,  Robert Bunker and John P. Sullivan, the authors of the new analysis, wrote.The drone-IED combination was found in central Mexico, by federal police who did a traffic stop on a stolen pickup truck with four men in it.Police found an AK-47, ammunition, phones and what the Small Wars Journal authors said appears to be a 3DR Solo Quadcopter, which retails for about $250 online. Taped to the drone was an IED, which could be trigger by remote detonator.Mr. Bunker and Mr. Sullivan said the  dron bomba,  as they labeled it, was the next step for cartels that have been using papas bombas, or potato bombs   a roughly shaped sphere with a core of explosives and nails and other shrapnel packed inside for the most lethal reach.The analysts said several examples of potato bombs have been detected in Mexico this year.In August, U.S. Border Patrol agents nabbed a $5,000 drone and seized a $46,000 meth load in southern California, after one agent detected it flying overhead. Agents also apprehended the man assigned to pick up the load, who said he had made a number of such pickups and was paid $1,000 each time.Meanwhile, the chiefs of the FBI and National Counterterrorism Center told Congress last month that they are worried Islamic State terrorists who have pioneered weaponized drones in the Middle East will use the tactic inside the U.S. to spread a toxin or drop a grenade.

Vietnam court sentences to death PetroVietnam ex-chairman in mass trial,"HANOI (Reuters) - A court in Vietnam sentenced to death a former chairman of state -run PetroVietnam on Friday after finding him guilty in a mass  trial of 51 officials and bankers accused of graft and mismanagement that led to losses of $69 million. The death sentence for ex-PetroVietnam chairman Nguyen Xuan Son was the first time in years it had been given to such a senior former official and comes amid an intensifying corruption crackdown and maneuvering within the ruling Communist Party. Son maintained his innocence and would appeal against the verdict from the People s Court of Hanoi, his lawyer, Le Minh Tam, told Reuters. The death penalty had been recommended by the state prosecution.  Vietnam is among the world s biggest executioners, according to Amnesty International. In recent years it has replaced firing squads with lethal injections. Son was on trial as both the former chairman of PetroVietnam and the former chief executive of Ocean Group s banking unit, Ocean Bank, which was taken over by the central bank in 2015 after being unable to pay its debts. The court in Hanoi also sentenced Ha Van Tham, founder of Ocean Group and once one of Vietnam s most high profile tycoons, to life imprisonment. He was found guilty of embezzlement, violations of bank lending regulations and abuse of power. Dozens of other banking and energy officials were also jailed.  These harsh sentences are mainly for public effect,  said Carl Thayer, a Vietnam expert at the Australian Defense Force Academy. But they would have little effect without improving governance in the one-party state, he said. The ruling Communist Party has taken a tougher stance on corruption since Vietnam s security establishment emerged stronger from a power struggle last year in which ex-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung lost out. Some critics have accused Vietnam s rulers of a witch-hunt following the launch of investigations implicating increasingly senior figures. Son was arrested in 2015, under the previous administration. On Friday, he was found guilty of embezzlement, intentional breaches of state rules over economic management leading to serious consequences and abuse of position and power. The head of a unit of state-run shipping firm Vinashin was sentenced to death over losses in February, but he was much less senior than Son. Investigations into PetroVietnam have seen a Politburo member who was a former PetroVietnam chairman, a vice trade minister sacked from their positions and a former deputy central bank governor prosecuted. The PetroVietnam investigations also grabbed global attention when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping former executive Trinh Xuan Thanh in Berlin last month to face trial over a separate case. Thanh had been cleared under Dung s government, official documents reviewed by Reuters showed. Dung lost out last year in the battle to secure the post of Communist Party General Secretary, Vietnam s most powerful position. The post remained in the hands of Nguyen Phu Trong, who has a more modest public profile. The court finished hearing the case against Son on Monday, when he pleaded for the court not to give  an unjust verdict  and said he could not believe he was being prosecuted for embezzlement and had become  like a soulless person.  Tham admitted the charge of lending violations at Ocean Bank, but denied graft allegations. Neither he nor Son were given a chance to speak after the verdict on Friday. Amnesty International said in April that Vietnam had executed more people than any country except China and Iran over the period from August 2013 to June 2016 after official figures showing 429 executions were published in local media.

Hillary Clinton swore before a federal court and told the American people she handed over all of her work-related emails. If Clinton did not consider emails about something as important as Benghazi to be work-related, one has to wonder what is contained in the other emails she attempted to wipe from her server.

" Legal Scholars Worried Trump Would Break Laws, Be Worse Than Nixon","What happens when conservative lawyers from the Cato Institute, Georgetown University and the Hoover Institution get together?Well, besides their opposition to Obamacare, they all come to the conclusion that Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for President of the United States, is bad for the law.In a recent article from the New York Times, these lawyers, all politically conservative, lambasted the billionaire mogul for his attacks against the First Amendment, individuals, the separation of powers, and the rule of law all together.In other words, these lawyers, without saying it, contend that Trump would be more crooked, more criminal, and more disastrous than Richard Nixon.Pointing out that his promise to tighten libel laws undermines the First Amendment, and that his proposal to ban Muslims from coming into the U.S. violates the Constitution s guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection, attorney Ilya Sharpiro   who works with the Cato Institute   said plainly,  Who knows what Donald Trump with a pen and phone would do. But it was Volokh Conspiracy (a conservative legal blog) writer and attorney David Post who had the harshest words for Trump. Saying his comments regarding Gonzalo P. Cruiel, the judge presiding over the Trump University case, resembled  authoritarianism,  Post argues that these outbursts disqualified him: This is how authoritarianism starts, with a president who does not respect the judiciary. You can criticize the judicial system, you can criticize individual cases, you can criticize individual judges. But the president has to be clear that the law is the law and that he enforces the law. That is his constitutional obligation. So not only does Trump hate the law, he has vowed to restore Trump University after the judge s decision. This blatant disregard for the rule of law should send chills down every American s spine. If Donald Trump, a now public, political figure and possibly future president, can openly disregard the law, who s to say the average American can t?Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown who was the architect behind the first major challenge to Obamacare, feels Trump doesn t know his limits: You would like a president with some idea about constitutional limits on presidential powers, on congressional powers, on federal powers, and I doubt he has any awareness of such limits. Richard Epstein, attorney with the Hoover Institution, was more blunt: I don t think he cares about separation of powers at all   I think Obama s been much worse on that issue [constitutional limits] pretty consistently, and his underlings have been even more so. But I think Trump doesn t even think there s an issue to worry about. He just simply says whatever I want to do I will do. I never thought the day would come when conservative lawyers would view Trump more dangerously than they do President Obama.Maybe Trump really does suck. Perhaps Republicans will begin to see the light when Hillary Clinton thrashes him on the debate stage.Featured image via Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images",News,"June 3, 2016",0,3144
CONGRESS JUST DEALT A BIG BLOW To Obama And His Favorite Terror Group [VIDEO],"Obama has shown favoritism towards the Muslim Brotherhood terror group almost since the first day of his presidency. Many are convinced Obama is tied to the terror group through his brother, and his desire to prevent Americans from referring to this group as a  terror group  doesn t do much to convince us he doesn t have some sort of ties to them. Obama quietly offered his support when the riots Arab Spring uprisings took place in Egypt, paving the way for the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist, Mohamed Morsy to take over as President of Egypt through  fair  elections The House Judiciary Committee passed a bill on Wednesday calling on the State Department to classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group, by a 17-10 party-line vote.The GOP leadership under Speaker Paul Ryan supports the legislation, a high-ranking Republican source told the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) on background. This makes floor passage more likely.The bill states that it is the  sense of Congress that the Muslim Brotherhood meets the criteria for classification as a foreign terrorist organization. Under the bill as amended by committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Secretary of State John Kerry would have 60 days to issue a detailed report to Congress indicating whether the Brotherhood meets the criteria qualifying it as a terrorist group. The Brotherhood s strategic goal in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and  sabotaging  its miserable house from within so that it is eliminated and God s religion is made victorious over all other religions,  Goodlatte said, quoting the Brotherhood s 1991 Explanatory Memorandum, in a statement given before the vote.Here is Muslim terror expert, Brigitte Gabriel explaining the plan by the Muslim Brotherhood to jihad in North America. After watching this, you may ask yourself what has taken Congress so long to act? The Brotherhood and its leaders and affiliates, such as Hamas, have supported Islamist terrorism   directly, through fundraising, and through exhortation. Each of these activities constitutes an act of terrorism under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under the bill, the Obama Administration would be forced to deny admittance to any foreign national tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.Since Obama became President, people connected to the Muslim Brotherhood have received entry visas despite their open support for terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.There are many who believe the Muslim Brotherhood has been given special treatment by our very own  President,  and that he is somehow tied to the group:HERE, Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) is asking why the Obama regime gave $1.5 BILLION to the Muslim Brotherhood:Previously banned individuals such as Sheikh Rached Ghannouchi, head of Tunisia s branch of the Brotherhood, and Tariq Ramadan, grandson of Brotherhood founder Hasan al-Banna, have been welcomed to the US by the Obama Administration despite their vocal support for Hamas. Ramadan fought his ban on entering the US in court, and won an appeal.Other foreign Brotherhood speakers such as Ragheb Elsergany exploit the platform given to them by the Obama Administration to advocate for Muslims to support Palestinian  mujahideen  fighting against Israel.If the Brotherhood were designated as a terrorist group, it would be a crime for people in the United Sates to provide material support to it, and the Treasury Department could force banks to block financial transactions related to the Brotherhood. The bill lists US groups, including the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), as groups under the control of the international Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood continues to pose a global threat. The jihadist movement actively supports and finances terrorist networks around the world, including al-Qaida and Hamas. The United States must recognize and sanction the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization as part of our national security strategy,  co-sponsor Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, (R-Fla.), said in a statement. Via: The Alemeiner ",politics,"Feb 26, 2016",0,4276
"Waiting for May, Brussels eyes December Brexit deal","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When Theresa May visits Brussels on Friday, EU negotiators will be listening intently for signs the British prime minister is preparing to risk a domestic backlash and raise her offer to secure a Brexit deal in December. European Union officials and diplomats from the other 27 member states involved in the process hope that within a week to 10 days of meeting European Council President Donald Tusk, during a summit with ex-Soviet neighbors, May will deliver movement on three key conditions so that her EU peers can launch a new phase of Brexit negotiations when they meet on Dec. 14-15.  I don t know what room for maneuver May has, but what we can see is a willingness to act,  one senior EU official told Reuters. Another spoke of efforts to arrange the  choreography  of a deal over the next three weeks, including a possible EU-UK  joint report  on interim accords to unlock talks on trade.  I feel the tectonic plates moving now,  a diplomat handling Brexit for an EU government said.  Time is running out and a failure in the December Council would serve nobody s purpose.  There has been only a day of top-level talks between the two lead negotiators since a mid-October summit that dismissed May s call for immediate talks on a future trade agreement.  But talks are continuing apace behind the scenes, participants say, ahead of a deadline of early December to strike a deal which can then be fully formalized by the 27 government leaders at the summit. Hopes have been raised by reports in British media that May has secured backing from pro-Brexit hardliners in her cabinet to increase the amount of a financial settlement of what Britain owes to the Union when it leaves in March 2019.   If there is a political willingness in Britain, we should be ready,  a senior EU official said, while warning that nothing was being taken for granted.  May s room for maneuver to cut a deal that would please business while irritating Britons who want a sharper break with Brussels is limited. And Germany and France, the Union s lead powers have taken a tough line so far. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel distracted at home by a search for a new coalition, May can expect little focus from her to help smooth a deal, several diplomats said, leaving it quite possible that December will not see an end to deadlock.   That would create some kind of crisis in negotiations,  the second EU official said, noting that time was already short to complete a treaty by late next year to ensure an orderly Brexit.  But maybe that is necessary.  EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who met Tusk on Wednesday to prepare Tusk s Friday meeting with May, had been expected to hold a formal round of talks with British Brexit Secretary David Davis in the week starting Dec. 4.  But EU officials say planning is all still up in the air. There could be a high-level meeting as soon as next week, possibly on Friday, Dec. 1, one said. The sides already believe they are quite close on agreeing the scope of rights for expatriate citizens in Britain and on the continent, though the EU will be particularly looking to pin Britain down to accepting its demands that any agreement be subject to enforcement through the Union s legal system. The third key criterion for moving to Phase Two, an outline agreement on how to avoid the new EU-UK land border disrupting the peace in Northern Ireland, remains a potential stumbling block. Differences of opinion between London and Dublin have been marked this month, worrying EU officials. However, it is the financial settlement that has been the most concern for the past few months and that, they believe, could be resolved by a combination of May stating clearly that Britain will pay a share after leaving of two major EU budget lines, staff pensions and agreed but undisbursed spending. British press reports, seen in Brussels as planted leaks from May s team, suggesting she might offer to pay something like 40 billion pounds ($53 billion) have encouraged EU negotiators.  While that is well short of the 60 billion euros ($71 billion) the European Commission has mentioned, that was always seen by EU officials as a maximum demand. And they are willing, they say, to help May massage the public messaging of the amount in order to limit the political flak she takes at home.  On presentational issues, Barnier is ready to help, not to call things by their real name,  an EU official said. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1,4495
"NFL CUTS FUNDS for Breast Cancer, Military Charity to Pay for Players’ $89 Million ‘Social Justice’ Activism","The NFL is toast They just caved to demands made by players to dump millions into a  social justice  boondoggle aimed at the black community. The problem is that the entire Black Lives Matter scam is a lie AND PLAYERS KNOW IT. There is now discord between players who feel differently about the kneeling protest. A lack of leadership by Goodell to put an end to the protests, has harmed the NFL  irreparably . The NFL is just another social justice program BOYCOTT!WHAT EXACTLY IS  SOCIAL JUSTICE ?The NFL met with a group of players and reached an agreement in principle late Wednesday night to partner on a plan to address social justice issues considered important to African-American communities, sources told ESPN.The unprecedented agreement calls for the league to contribute $89 million over seven years to projects dealing with criminal justice reform, law enforcement/community relations and education.During a conference call Wednesday night, Malcolm Jenkins and Anquan Boldin, who lead roughly 40 players who have negotiated with the league office about demonstrations during the national anthem, guided the group through the highlights of the package, which represents the NFL s largest contribution to a social issue, surpassing that of Salute to Service or Breast Cancer Awareness/Crucial Catch.The partnership came a day after some players broke away from the Players Coalition because of their dissatisfaction with how Jenkins and Boldin have handled negotiations. Commissioner Roger Goodell, believing that an agreement was at hand, was furious when ESPN reported that players were breaking off, according to one source. But during an afternoon call, Jenkins asked that the commissioner and the owners continue to stand with the players and allow them to do important work in the community.NO END IN SIGHT FOR PROTESTS:The agreement does not include language calling for players to end protests during the national anthem in exchange for funds; there s no implicit quid pro quo. But the NFL hopes this effort will effectively end the peaceful yet controversial movement that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started in 2016, when he refused to stand for the anthem.Via: ESPN",left-news,"Dec 3, 2017",0,2322
NANCY SINATRA Says 5 MILLION “Murderous Members” of the NRA “Should Face A Firing Squad”,"Nancy Sinatra sent out an absolutely vile tweet today, that suggested 5 million NRA members should be killed by a firing squad. The tweet didn t mention the Las Vegas massacre, but the timing of her tweet seems to be in line with the 100 s of celebrities who are using this horrific massacre as an opportunity to push gun-control in America. Here is a screenshot of the tweet she sent out on Twitter today. Sinatra has since removed her disgusting tweet, but the screenshot of her horrific suggestion is here to stay.Another day, another liberal entertainer wishing harm, or in the case of Nancy Sinatra, death on millions of Americans. When do American citizens, who are sick and tired of being abused, berated, and slapped around by celebrities who have no respect our God-given rights, stop supporting their industry? When will we cut the cord, and turn off the NFL, and turn off shows like  Will and Grace  who admittedly are making a return to TV so they can promote an anti-Trump message to their viewers? When will Americans find something better to do with their time than watching a TV show or movie featuring an actor or actress who boldly stands against our First and Second Amendment Rights, and regularly spews hate against our President because he bravely defends those inalienable rights?If you want to see a man who faces a  firing squad  each and every day, while celebrities sit comfortably in their Malibu mansions, acting as keyboard warriors for the left, attacking him and anyone who supports him,  you don t have to look too far:Celebrity Sheryl Crow joined the hate fest against gun owners and called out politicians who support our Second Amendment Right by saying:  Any politician who takes money from the NRA has blood on their hands.

"Election over, Congress pivots to lame-duck debate over spending","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With a bitter election campaign finally over, the Congress will reconvene this week to try to set aside its partisan differences long enough to keep the government from closing. As President-elect Donald Trump shapes his administration, Republicans are expected to move away from initial plans for compromise funding legislation and opt instead for a short-term measure to keep the government running into next year, when they will have control of Congress and the White House.   Washington has been operating since Oct. 1 under a temporary “continuing resolution” on the budget. It expires on Dec. 9. Lawmakers will be trying to approve a new one before then. Mired in partisan gridlock, Congress in recent years has seldom completed the entire federal budget process, falling back frequently on stop-gap measures that last a few months. During their “lame-duck” session starting this week, lawmakers will have little time to draft another continuing resolution to cover funding U.S. agencies and military operations. Congress is tentatively set to adjourn by Dec. 17 and has an additional break over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. A new Congress will meet in January, with the 100-seat Senate more closely split than before last week’s elections. Neither party will have the 60 votes needed to move legislation easily through the chamber. The voters last Tuesday also preserved the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, though it is slightly smaller, giving the Democrats more power to block the Republicans. Legislation to streamline federal regulations for new drugs could come up during the lame duck session. So could funding for cancer research, precision medicine and treatments for opioid addiction, said congressional aides. Some conservative House Republicans want a budget measure that will expire in March, which would coincide with needed action on the federal debt limit, according to House aides. Others have talked about a continuing resolution that would run until sometime February, giving the new president and Congress enough time to determine their priorities for more comprehensive funding legislation for the remainder of the federal fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. Before the election shifted the political center of gravity in favor of Republicans, Republican leaders had talked about crafting funding legislation through negotiations with Democrats and President Barack Obama and approving it before Christmas.

Families of lost Argentina submarine crew decry government response,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Dozens of relatives of the 44 crew members of an Argentine submarine that went missing on November 15 marched from a naval base on Sunday, demanding to know what happened and criticizing the government s response to the tragedy. Holding posters with photos of the crew and chanting  Search and Rescue!  the family members walked away from a naval base in Mar del Plata, following a press conference during which the navy said the submarine had still not been located. The disaster has spurred soul searching over the state of the military in Argentina, which now has one of Latin America s smallest defense budgets in relation to economic size after a series of financial crises.   Our disagreement is with the government, not with the navy,  said Marcela Moyano, wife of crew member Hern n Rodr guez, during the protest.  Whoever is responsible needs to be held responsible.  Spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Thursday the navy had abandoned hope of rescuing the crew alive, noting the ARA San Juan had air supplies for a week while 15 days had passed since it last reported its position. Some family members complained they were not advised before the general public of the end of the rescue mission and have also demanded more contact with President Mauricio Macri in Mar del Plata, where the San Juan was scheduled to end its journey.  While local media have speculated Macri will soon declare a period of national mourning for the submarine crew, he has been silent in recent days.  He (Macri) needs to be here because this is the priority, there are 44 families behind this situation and someone has to be in charge,  said Marcela Fern ndez, wife of Alberto S nchez. Macri s defense minister met with families in Mar del Plata on Friday. Balbi said on Saturday an object that was being reviewed by a Russian unmanned remotely operated vehicle in the South Atlantic had turned out not to be the submarine. The government has pledged to continue the search with foreign assistance. The navy said on Nov. 27 that water that entered the submarine s snorkel caused its battery to short-circuit before it went missing. The navy had previously said international organizations detected a noise that could have been the submarine s implosion the same day contact was lost. ",worldnews,"December 3, 2017 ",1,2361

 Store Owner Where Alton Sterling Was Killed Suing Baton Rouge Police,"The plot is definitely thickening when it comes to the horrific death of an African-American man at the hands of two white police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Abdullah Muflahi owns the Triple S Food Mart, where the events of that fateful night took place. Now, he has filed a lawsuit against the police. The suit alleges that in the aftermath of the murder of Alton Sterling, whom Muflahi allowed to sell his CD s out front of the store, Muflahi was taken into custody like a common criminal, where the cops took his cell phone, along with surveillance video of the shooting. All of this was done without a warrant, which is definitely illegal, and reeks of a cover-up. The suit says of what happened: At all times defendants knew that plaintiff Muflahi was only a witness to the events at his store and that being a witness did not entitle police to hold plaintiff in custody or seize or commandeer his store and store equipment. Of course, the cops are not talking about these new developments. Muflahi is suing the cops who shot Sterling, as well as the city of Baton Rouge itself. Also named in the lawsuit are the investigating officers and the Baton Rouge police chief. There was no warrant for any of the store s surveillance footage until roughly five hours after the cops murdered Alton Sterling, so they had no right to immediately take that footage, and at no point should Abdullah Muflahi been taken into custody for any reason. He was a witness to a crime committed by the Baton Rouge police. He is not the criminal here.The document that requested the warrant claimed that Sterling did not put his hands on the hood of a car when he was told to do so, and therefore tasers were used. They saw what they believed to be a gun sticking out of Sterling s pocket, and therefore they tased him. Now, anyone with knowledge of tasers knows that they incapacitate the average person pretty well. There was no need to shoot and kill him, but of course the cops claim otherwise: When the subject attempted to reach for the gun from his pocket, the officers fired their police-issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat. I d be willing to bet they erased what footage they could, along with any video on the cell phone they unlawfully took from Abdullah Muflahi. It will be just as doctored as the stories they are telling regarding the shooting itself. This is nothing more than the police doing their damndest to keep their murderous brothers in blue out of an indictment and possible prison time.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",News,"July 12, 2016",0,2634
" BREAKING: Trump Is Playing With Fire, And He Just Brought Us One Step Closer To Nuclear War","North Korea just made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of backing down from Trump, and that Trump, for all his dick-swinging, does not scare them. In fact, according to the U.K. s Mirror, North Korea just let loose with a blistering warning to Trump over his posturing: Our toughest counteraction against the US and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive.We ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a US pre-emptive strike. Their vice foreign minister also added this: Whatever comes from the US, we will cope with it. We are fully prepared. The army and people will courageously counter those who encroach upon our dignity and sovereignty and will always mercilessly ravage all provocative options of the US. They ve also flat-out said,  We will go to war if they choose,  clearly putting the ball in our court as to whether or not war happens.Trump reportedly threatened to hit North Korea with Tomahawks the same missiles we launched into Syria to destroy absolutely nothing if they go ahead with a nuclear test this weekend. But that s not all   we also recently test-dropped an inert nuclear bomb to ensure that our military planes can carry and deliver it.There s a slim chance we could decide to use that on North Korea.It s not that North Korea isn t a problem. It s that this military show is having the opposite effect of what Trump no doubt thinks should be happening, despite North Korea being a very aggressive regime. And there will be collateral damage if we launch a pre-emptive strike at North Korea. They ll hit our bases in South Korea, but they may also retaliate directly against our allies in the region, including Japan.If it s nuclear war, well, the whole world will suffer.China is begging both us and North Korea to cool it. Russia has also asked both countries to be very careful. South Korea has warned us not to start anything on the peninsula without their consent as a military ally.

" Trump Made The Most DELUSIONAL Statement About Obamacare, America’s Response Is PERFECT (TWEETS)","Apparently, Donald Trump has yet to learn his lesson about attacking former President Barack Obama.Last weekend, the disgraceful Tweeter in Chief decided to accuse his beloved predecessor of wiretapping his phones in the Trump Tower before the U.S. election. He immediately regretted this, because his reckless lies ignited not only tons of backlash against him, but also prompted further investigations into the Russia scandal.America has not even recovered from the shock that a current POTUS would accuse a former leader of the free world of doing such a thing. Regardless, Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to attack Obama again. At around 9:30 am, Trump exercised at least some self-control and only tweeted one anti-Obama message, this time insulting Obamacare while hyping up the GOP s replacement bill (which by the way, is an absolute disaster and pretty much hated by everyone). Trump tweeted:Trump s claim that Obamacare is  imploding  is just as hilarious as it is ridiculous. Of course, there are some things about Obamacare that could use amending. But Americans, for the most part, are very happy with Obamacare and are pissed off that the Republican Party is going to repeal it, stripping millions of people of their health care. Not to mention, the sloppy replacement plan that the GOP is putting in place has already been highly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike and is sure to be a death sentence for many Americans.Fortunately, America isn t about to let Trump forget that his ideas suck. Once Trump tweeted his attack on Obamacare, Twitter users rushed in to take Trump right off his high horse and bring him back to reality. Here are some of the best responses:      Trump is absolutely delusional if he thinks the GOP s plan is going to put Obamacare to shame   and Americans will make sure he realizes it.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"March 11, 2017",0,1986

And if anything can be shown by the polls that have shown Trump holding a huge lead over his competition, it s that the Republican base prefers bigotry and bombastic hyperbole or facts, figures, and a solid plan for the future.Trump being as he is, isn t exactly new either. He s always been the narcissist that he actually, truly is. He s always thought his ideas are perfect and his shit doesn t stink. He s even gone so far as to compare a book he wrote to the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.Back in 2011, while pushing people to buy his latest batch of drivel, he made just that comparison:First there was the Declaration of Independence, then there was the Constitution. Now there is #TimeToGetTough. Available today.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2011His book Time to Get Tough  also held a very familiar tagline:  Making America #1 Again. Trump honestly sees himself as a savior of sorts, a deity that will magically solve all the nations problems. In comparing himself to the Founding Fathers he resorts to an emotion that those dumb enough to fall for the line, will see him as just as profound as those who sought to make freedom a national ideal and form a new nation.The thing is, he s no savior, nor is he anything like the Founding Fathers. He s a narcissistic businessman out for himself and wants to see how far he can go. Not for the nation, but for his own ego. Just listen to any campaign rally, he s obsessed with polls numbers and will talk the entire time about how  great  he is, and spend next to zero time talking about any sort of plans or policy.America is already great, and if you want to keep it that way, make sure you vote blue this November.Featured image: Flickr/Twitter",News,"January 31, 2016",0,2094

He s compared it to owning his own printing press, and while he won t be nominated for a Pulitzer any time soon, his pronouncements of  Sad!  have already become a campaign clich .The downside of Twitter and parody videos like this for Trump, however, are that they expose how juvenile and simplistic his campaign and the Republican Party are.

Acting SEC chair signals support for penalties in foreign bribery cases,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, known for his critical views on corporate penalties, expressed some support on Friday for imposing them in cases in which companies violate foreign bribery laws. “I am generally comfortable with assessing civil monetary penalties in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases,” Acting SEC Chairman Michael Piwowar said in remarks at the Practising Law Institute’s “SEC Speaks” conference. “According to academic literature, there is evidence that when such violations are revealed to the market, the stock price does not always fall, and may even increase,” he added. Piwowar’s comments come at a time when many on Wall Street have been questioning whether the Justice Department and the SEC will ease enforcement of the FCPA. Prior to being elected, President Donald Trump expressed concern about the FCPA, calling it a “horrible law” that should be changed. In addition, Trump’s pick to lead the SEC, attorney Jay Clayton, previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced. Clayton is still awaiting U.S. Senate confirmation. Piwowar’s comments suggest there is likely to be some support among SEC commissioners to continue pursuing foreign bribery cases, given the impact FCPA disclosures have on share prices. Piwowar is well known for being critical about how the SEC decides when to assess corporate penalties generally, amid concerns that sizeable fines against public companies may in some cases unduly punish ordinary shareholders who are already victims of the alleged wrongdoing. He previously voted against imposing penalties against JPMorgan Chase & Co over its “London Whale” trades. The SEC did not win authority from Congress to seek penalties until 1990, and even then, the agency was slow to embrace the practice until after the major accounting scandals at companies like Enron and Worldcom. But in 2006, then-SEC Chair Chris Cox shifted gears amid concerns from some SEC officials about corporate penalties and issued guidance that spells out factors the commission should consider when determining whether to levy them. Piwowar said on Friday he closely follows those guidelines. “It is entirely appropriate to discipline and punish corporate malefactors who violate our laws,”  he said.  But the SEC must “remember the innocent investors” who are also victims, he added. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2017 ",1,2548
Toxic firecracker haze darkens Indian capital after festival of lights,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Air pollution in New Delhi hit 18 times the healthy limit on Friday under a thick, toxic haze after a night of fireworks to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali - despite a court-ordered ban on their sales. Residents of the sprawling Indian capital, which already ranks among the world s most polluted cities, complained of eyes watering and aggravated coughs as levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that reaches deep into the lungs, rose alarmingly. Air quality usually worsens in New Delhi ahead of Diwali, the festival of lights, and the Supreme Court temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers, aiming to lessen the risk to health. But many still lit fireworks across the capital late into the night, either using old stocks or buying them from neighboring states.  Some environment activists said the court order was poorly enforced and firecrackers were still available to celebrate one of north India s biggest festivals.  Breathe nitrate and ammonia, home grown, hand made!  said environmentalist Vimlendu Jha in a Twitter post calling for city authorities to declare a public emergency. An index of air quality had crossed the  hazardous  limit of 300 on Friday, the most severe level on a U.S. embassy scale of measurement which rates a reading of 50 as good and anything above that as a cause for concern.  Some parts of Delhi such as Mandir Marg showed an air quality reading of 941, close enough to the maximum level of 999 beyond which no readings are available. The index measures concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide among other indicators.  A hazardous level is an alert in which everyone may experience ill effects and are advised to stay indoors. Apart from the firecracker ban, the Supreme Court also ordered diesel generators and a power plant to be shut down to try to reduce the pollution. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority also ordered some brick kilns to close and a halt to the burning of rubbish. Dipankar Saha, a scientist at the government s Central Pollution Control Board, said the still weather had also played a part in the toxic haze hanging over the city. But pollution levels were better than at last year s Diwali when crop burning in nearby states and firecrackers combined.   It was going to be hard to beat last year s level in any case,  he said.

"DEMOCRAT SENATOR AL FRANKEN Thought It Would Be Hilarious To Do An SNL Skit About Drugging and Raping 60 Minutes Reporter: “when Lesley’s passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her”","Democratic Senator Al Franken   who has been accused of kissing a woman without her consent and pretending to grope her in a photo   once pitched an SNL sketch about raping a journalist, it has emerged.The remarks were made in 1995, when Franken and other writers on the show were working up a sketch about then-60 Minutes host Andy Rooney finding a bottle of pills in his desk, New York Magazine reported at the time.As the team batted ideas around, Franken suggested that the pills might be used by Rooney to drug Lesley Stahl at which point he would  take her to the closet and rape her .The sketch was part of an ongoing series in which Norm Macdonald portrayed Rooney as an out-of-touch misanthrope with a tenuous grasp on reality.Macdonald had suggested that Rooney could say  I don t know what the pills are for   what I do know is, the bottle is mostly filled with cotton. Franken then chipped in with:  And,  I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then, when Lesley s passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her. Or,  That s why you never see Lesley until February.  Or,  When she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her. Stahl was a contributor to 60 Minutes at the time. Macdonald then asked,  What if Rooney rapes Mike Wallace? And then says,  I guess that makes me bad.  Is it funnier with a black guy? Or two old white guys? Franken responded:  What about,  I drag Mike into my office and rape him. Right here! I guess that makes me bad. The sketch never made it to air, and it s questionable whether it was ever intended to do so.But the 1995 report has now resurfaced   as it did in 2008, when Franken made his successful run for Minnesota Senator.At the time, his campaign said:  Al understands, and the people of Minnesota understand, the difference between what a satirist does and what a senator does. But newly emerged claims that Franken kissed a woman without her consent in 2006, and pretended to grope her in a photo while she was sleeping have been tougher for the comedian to address.

China's most-wanted fugitive jailed for eight years for graft,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court on Friday jailed the country s number one most wanted fugitive for eight years for graft and taking bribes, state media said. Yang Xiuzhu, a former deputy mayor of Wenzhou city in the booming eastern province of Zhejiang, gave herself in to Chinese authorities late last year, returning from the United States after spending 13 years in hiding. China ranked Yang top in a 2015 list of its 100 most wanted graft suspects who were targeted with Interpol red notices. Many on the list had fled to the United States, Canada or Australia. Some 48 have since returned to China. Yang s prison sentence and a fine of 800,000 yuan  ($121,500) was announced by the People s Intermediate Court in Hangzhou, the official Xinhua news agency said on social media. The court gave Yang a reduced sentence as she had expressed regret, pleaded guilty and actively returned her illegal gains, as well returned to China, Xinhua reported. In under three years in her position at the construction bureau, Yang had embezzled nearly 20 million yuan in public funds and had accepted over 7 million yuan in gifts. Just under 27 million yuan of this had been recovered, the court said. It was not possible to reach Yang or a representative for comment. President Xi Jinping s war on graft has spread beyond China s borders with overseas searches dubbed Operation Fox Hunt and Sky Net hunting down officials and business executives who fled overseas with their assets. Wary that suspects might not get a fair trial and that accusations may be politically motivated, some developed nations have been hesitant to comply with Beijing s requests to return people to China. Yang told Reuters in 2015 that she was innocent and called the most-wanted list a political document targeting enemies of the current regime rather than a roster of criminals.

 The Daily Show Destroys Republican Claims That Democrats Are The Real Racists (VIDEO),"This is one Daily Show segment that every Republican should be forced to watch over and over until they learn the true history of their own party.On Thursday night, Trevor Noah tackled the Republican claim that Democrats are the real racists because Lincoln freed the slaves and the KKK backed Democrats for decades after the Civil War.Earlier this week, former Obama adviser Van Jones had a heated argument with right-wing CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord, who defended Donald Trump by claiming that the KKK is a Democratic creation built to  further the progressive agenda. What the f*ck?  Noah responded.  I ve seen this argument on Facebook   in fact, I ve seen it everywhere online.  Did you know that Democrats are the real racist party? And did you know the Republican Party freed the slaves? Noah called Lord s claim  bullshit,  and proceeded to delve into history to demonstrate how the KKK switched their allegiance to the Republican Party. A lot of people like to skip over the fact that, when it comes to race relations, historically, Republicans and Democrats switched positions,  Noah said.  Yeah. Republicans were basically Democrats, and Democrats were basically Republicans. Noah explained that while it s true that the KKK supported Democrats for decades after Lincoln freed and slaves, the white supremacist group switched to a more welcoming Republican Party in the 1960s after Democrats began supporting and enacting policies like the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Presidents Harry S Truman and Lyndon Johnson, both southerners, angered what became known as the Dixiecrats, Southern Democrats who left the Democratic Party starting in 1948 in opposition to the expansion of civil rights.Johnson would predict while signing the Civil Rights Act of 1965 that Democrats just  lost the South for a generation. He was half-right,  Noah said,  because, in fact, the Democrats lost the South for more than a generation. Indeed, the once proud party of Lincoln quickly became a big tent for racists to flock to for shelter and it has not only remained that way ever since, the racists have now seized control of the party entirely.Noah even used  huge racist  former Senator Strom Thurmond as an example of how Southern Democrats turned Republican. Strom Thurmond was among the most racist politicians of his generation, and in the  60s, he switched to being a Republican because he felt more welcome,  Noah said of Thurmond, who started his political career as a Democrat in the 1930s. Just because something used to be something, doesn t mean it still is,  Noah said.  What matters more is what it is now. Like a butterfly used to be a caterpillar   you don t call it a flying caterpillar. Here s the video via Comedy Central:The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveIn short, what matters is that the Republican Party is associated with the KKK and the KKK supports the Republican Party. That s been the case for a few decades now, but it s incredibly obvious today in 2016. And America is now dangerously close to having a President who pals around with the KKK and other white supremacists.Featured image: Houston Chronicle",News,"March 4, 2016",0,3322
U.S. Customs give airlines green light to board all visa-holders after Seattle ruling,"(Reuters) - U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) has informed U.S. airlines that they can once again board travelers who had been barred by an executive order last week, after it was blocked nationwide on Friday by a federal judge in Seattle, an airline official told Reuters. In a conference call at around 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT), the U.S. agency told airlines to operate just as they had before the order, which temporarily had stopped refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Individuals from those states who have proper visas can now board U.S.-bound flights, and airlines are working to update their websites to reflect the change, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The judge’s temporary restraining order represents a major challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump’s action, although his administration could still appeal the ruling and have the policy upheld. Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, made his ruling effective immediately on Friday, suggesting that travel restrictions could be lifted straight away. He is expected to issue a full written ruling over the weekend. CBP and Washington-based trade group Airlines for America did not immediately comment. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2017 ",1,1348
 Trump Goes BALLISTIC As White House Correspondents Dinner Continues Without Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump may be one of the most bitter, petty people on the planet. Several weeks ago, Trump announced that he would not be attending the White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington because he couldn t handle the media s criticism. As the WH Correspondents Dinner finally took place last night without Trump, he basically threw a fit during a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania because the event was held  without the president. If Trump expected the annual event to be canceled because the country s commander-in-chief decided to be a temperamental man-baby, he was proven wrong last night   and obviously couldn t handle the fact that the media and several celebrities still wanted to go. In an unhinged, unpresidential rant, Trump blasted the media and all in attendance of the WH Correspondents Dinner.Trump lied and said he could not possibly more thrilled  to be far away from the  Washington swamp , where the reporters were consoling each other in a hotel ballroom.  Trump then bragged about the size of his crowds in comparison to the dinner before pointing to the cameras and saying they would actually rather be here.  Trump s delusional fans loved every second of it, and were soon chanting  CNN sucks , encouraging Trump to go off even more on  fake news . He said: They would love to be with us here tonight, but they re trapped at the dinner which will be very, very boring. With the encouragement from the crowd, Trump then recycled all his usual attacks, such as Hillary Clinton and the New York Times   a tactic Trump regularly uses because he isn t intelligent enough to talk about his actual policies.If there was ever a speech that displayed just how insecure and small-minded Trump is, it was this one.

The boat capsized on Thursday morning while farmers were being ferried to their farmlands. Dharavath Pradeep Kumar, a senior police officer who was leading rescue operations, said the boat was carrying 40 people, many more than its capacity of 25. It capsized not far from the river bank in Katha village in northern Uttar Pradesh state, 45 km (30 miles) north of the capital, New Delhi.  Eleven people were rescued and were admitted to a  government hospital, he said. Kumar said police were investigating the boat operator. ",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",1,753
Democrats take aim at Mnuchin as confirmation hearing looms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Borrowers who say OneWest Bank refused to help them when they struggled to pay their mortgages appeared Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where they urged the U.S. Senate to vote against confirming the bank’s former chief executive, Steven Mnuchin, as Treasury Secretary. The event, organized by Senate Democrats including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, featured a handful of OneWest borrowers who spoke about their personal experiences.  They included an 86-year-old woman who said the bank ordered her to pay off a reverse mortgage or get out of her house after her husband died, and a Nevada mother of two who lost her home in 2010 after she was unable to secure a loan modification. “Steve Mnuchin’s company had no interest in helping us,” said the Nevada mother, Heather McCreary. “They wanted to foreclose because they were focused on their profits.” Mnuchin, whose confirmation hearing is Thursday, is the latest of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees to find himself in the crosshairs of Senate Democrats. Democrats have seized on his financial career during the housing crisis, when he bought discounted assets of the failed California lender IndyMac Bank.  He rebranded it as OneWest Bank. The institution was later accused by housing advocacy groups and others of engaging in overly aggressive foreclosure tactics. Mnuchin is no longer with OneWest, which was sold to CIT Group. Mnuchin is expected to respond directly to the allegations in his testimony on Thursday, according to a copy of his prepared remarks seen by Reuters. “In the press it has been said that I ran a ‘foreclosure machine,’” he plans to say.  “This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures.” Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate do not have the power alone to block Trump’s nominees.  But that has not stopped them from trying to draw attention to their concerns.  One tactic has included holding informal hearings and inviting outside witnesses to testify - a method that was also used last week in an effort by Democrats to raise questions about Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder’s record as chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl Jr.’s fast-food chains. Puzder’s confirmation hearing is slated for Feb. 2. ",politicsNews,"January 18, 2017 ",1,2373
 Justice Dept. Has Had Enough — Sues Ferguson Over Police Misconduct,"The Department of Justice laid down the law on Wednesday and announced that they have had enough and they are suing Ferguson for police misconduct. The decision to sue came after the Ferguson City Council voted on Tuesday to change the terms of a deal that had been negotiated over seven months.The DOJ began investigating Ferguson police after 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by former police officer Darren Wilson. Although Wilson was cleared of any wrongdoing, federal authorities found a pattern of abuse and systematic racism within the department.For seven months federal authorities and the city hashed out a deal to fix the problems within the police department. In a tentative agreement the city agreed to hire consultants to train officials, require every officer to have a dash or body cam, abide by specific guidelines for when officers can stop and question people on the streets, along with a number of other things. On Tuesday, though, the city suddenly decided that they wanted to alter the agreement. Shortly after the vote, the feds released a statement: The Ferguson City Council has attempted to unilaterally amend the negotiated agreement,  Vanita Gupta, head of the agency s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.  Their vote to do so creates an unnecessary delay in the essential work to bring constitutional policing to the city, and marks an unfortunate outcome for concerned community members and Ferguson police officers. On Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch dropped the lawsuit on the brilliant city council. She told reporters, We intend to aggressively prosecute this case and we intend to prevail.  She continued: The residents of Ferguson have suffered the deprivation of their constitutional rights, the rights guaranteed to all Americans, for decades. They have waited decades for justice. They should not be forced to wait any longer These violations were not only egregious, they were routine. They were encouraged by the city in the interest of raising revenue. They were driven, at least in part, by racial bias and they occurred disproportionately against African-American residents of Ferguson. The fact is, the city has failed the people of Ferguson on so many levels and now they are going to waste millions of dollars trying to fight the federal government because THEY tried to play fast and loose with the DOJ. They knew that their actions on Tuesday would result in litigation, but they took it as seriously as they take protecting people in their city.Hopefully, the citizens of Ferguson are able to get rid of each and every one of the council members who played a role in this vote.

 Former Fed. Prosecutor Thinks Trump Could Go To Prison Over This One Tweet (IMAGE),"Donald Trump is known for starting fights with people on his favorite social media platform, Twitter. The Republican presidential primary frontrunner may have started a fight that might land him in jail.Trump s latest feud is with the Marlene Ricketts, one of the owners of the Chicago Cubs. Ricketts donated $3 million dollars to a SuperPAC, that has the intent of taking down Donald Trump. The SuperPAC called the  Our Principles PAC  is being run by Katie Packer. Packer is a former advisor to Mitt Romney. Here s the Tweet:Ricketts responded to the Tweet, saying: It s a little surreal when Donald Trump threatens your mom but you know, the fact is whether it s my mom or my dad on his spending stuff or my sister on marriage equality or my brothers on what they do or what we do with the team, we re pretty much an open book. We stand up for what we believe in, we support the cause we think is important, and that s what America should be. Robert Reich wrote about the matter on his Facebook page on Friday night. That s where he said that one of his friends thinks that Trump violated the law when he put that Tweet out. After noting Trump s statements that he would prosecute Hillary Clinton over her private email server, Reich writes: My friend Arthur Ferguson, a former federal prosecutor, thinks Trump s statement violates the federal law criminalizing extortionate threats. 18 USC Section 875(d) reads:  Whoever, with intent to extort from any person   anything of value transmits   any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation [of anyone]   shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.' I m doubtful that anyone would actually consider prosecuting Trump over the matter, though Republicans are working double time to try and prevent a Trump presidential nomination. They are all looking for a way to take down his campaign, and a criminal investigation might do just the trick. Featured image from Gage Skidmore via Flickr",News,"February 27, 2016",0,2086

Prominent Australian opposition lawmaker quits over claims of China links,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A prominent Australian opposition senator, Sam Dastyari, said on Tuesday he would resign from parliament after a series of allegations emerged about his links with Chinese-aligned interests in Australia. Relations between Australia and China have become strained since Australia announced last week it would ban foreign political donations as part of a crackdown aimed at preventing external influence in domestic politics. In announcing the ban, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull specifically singled out China, citing  disturbing reports about Chinese influence . China hit back, with the ruling Communist Party s official People s Daily describing media reports about its interference as  racist  and  paranoid . Dastyari, widely viewed as a rising star of the center-left Labor opposition party, has been under fire since domestic media reported he had sought to encourage the party s deputy leader not to meet a Chinese pro-democracy activist opposed to Beijing s rule in Hong Kong in 2015.  Today, after much reflection, I ve decided that the best service I can render to the federal parliamentary Labor Party is to not return to the Senate in 2018,  Dastyari told reporters in Sydney. Asked about Dastyari s resignation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said it was an internal affair for Australia and China did not comment on other countries  affairs. The latest allegations came just days after Turnbull on Monday told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Dastyari had warned Chinese political donor Huang Xiangmo that his telephone might be tapped. Dastyari had already quit some senior Labor positions after a tape surfaced of him appearing to endorse China s contentious expansion in disputed areas of the South China Sea, against his party s platform. The tape showed him standing next to Huang. Turnbull accused the Labor Party of  failing to put Australia first , rhetoric that analysts said could widen divisions between Canberra and Beijing.  The row has erupted and it has claimed a political scalp,  said Euan Graham, director, international security program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank.   China could retaliate through non-official sanctions such as reduced tourist numbers or through buying of goods elsewhere.  China, which is easily Australia s biggest trading partner, bought A$93 billion ($70 billion) worth of Australian goods and services last year. But growing trade ties are only one side of a delicate balancing act for Australia, whose unshakeable security relationship with the United States has limited how cosy it gets with China. The recent political focus on Dastyari s China links has been a welcome distraction for Turnbull, who is suffering a slump in popularity in a country where three prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010. The fragility of his center-right government will be tested on Saturday when a by-election in the blue-ribbon conservative constituency of Bennelong in Sydney could see Turnbull again lose his majority in parliament, should Labour win.

Bulgarians use 'speed dating' to get know migrants,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Couples lining up to face each other are given 30 seconds to chat before moving on - in a version of speed dating that, rather than sparking romance, aims to promote understanding and integration for new immigrants. At a social center in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, the locals stand on one side, the immigrants - many refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries - face them.  The quick-fire conversations - in which participants have just seconds to share their dreams and stories of love, pain and family - are aimed at starting a dialogue between two communities that in normal daily life rarely speak to each other on an equal footing.  It s so good to have an event like this, especially for refugees,  said Rodi Naamo, a 26-year-old Syrian Kurd who arrived in Bulgaria in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of migrants passed through the Balkans en route to Germany and northern Europe.  Bulgarians also appreciated the speedy encounters, as well as the Middle Eastern food and traditional Afghan dances afterwards.  I really enjoyed it, it helped me overcome prejudices,  said Milka Bocheva, a Bulgarian who runs an online business.  They (the refugees) are just people like us, we gave such similar answers.  Bulgaria stands out in the region for its significant Muslim minority, some 12 percent among 7.1 million mainly Orthodox Christians - a legacy of its history as part of the Ottoman Empire.  Despite that, large parts of the population are concerned about the influx of asylum-seekers and migrants.  Naamo, who returned to Bulgaria after a short spell in Germany, to work in a call center, believes opinions are starting to change.  I decided to stay here, this is my country. I ll bring my family here,  he said.   ",worldnews,"October 12, 2017 ",1,1815
 Dem Lawmaker Out-Trolls Internet Troll By Calling His Grandmother (IMAGE),"The Internet can be a vicious place and an openly gay lawmaker has gotten used to being the recipient of homophobic slurs. On Wednesday morning, Pennsylvania House Rep. Brian Sims woke up to find a message on his Facebook page which read,  N**ger faggot.  There wasn t much information on the troll s Facebook page. What caught me about it was there wasn t a reference to something I said or something I d done or some policy,  Sims told the Huffington Post.  And when I looked at his page there was very little there   but he d posted a telephone number a number of times. At 6:15 a.m. Sims decided to call the number and the woman who answered the phone turned out to be the troll s grandmother. You ve all seen the  Brave keyboard warrior sitting in Mom s basement eating a hot pocket sandwich  type meme but this was real life. I explained to her exactly who I as and what he had done,  Sims said.  Like any grandma she was very embarrassed at having this kind of convo and very ashamed at the actions of her grandson. The conversation ended with me telling her that I wanted to hear from him. Sims did speak to the troll but he said that the conversation  didn t resolve anything. It is the ultimate calling card of a coward to   under the guise of night and behind a keyboard   use the kind of language that in person would cause most decent people to respond in anger and frustration,  Sims said.  The reason people do things like this is they don t have the courage, the education or gumption to do this kind of thing in person.

YOUR BLOOD WILL BOIL When You See Why College Students Were Forced To Stand Guard Over Thousands Of U.S. FLAGS Meant To Honor 9-11 Victims On Their Liberal Campus,"This is how coddled kids who have never had to deal with losing an innocent family member, friend or co-worker at the hands of evil Islamic terrorists behaves At Occidental College on Saturday, vandals trashed 2,977 U.S. flags planted in the quad to memorialize those who died on Sept. 11.The students who planted the small American flags found them uprooted and thrown in campus garbage cans. Every last flag. Some were even snapped in half.Not only that, dozens of makeshift fliers accompanied the vandalism. Taped to benches and other surfaces, most of the fliers stated  R.I.P.  to 9/11 victims as well as to 1.45 million Iraqis who died  during the U.S. invasion for something they didn t do. Sophomore Alan Bliss, a math and economics major who helped lead the effort to plant the flags, told The College Fix in a telephone interview Sunday that when he and a friend came across the destroyed memorial, three students confronted him and said they found the display  triggering.  He said the students also accused him of white privilege and ignorance.Occidental is a small liberal-arts college in Los Angeles known as far-left.

So when the right or even moderates try to do something on campus there is extreme push back,  Bliss said of his school, adding conservatives are a  silent majority  there and some students are even scared of speaking up against progressives for fear of retribution.As for the display, Bliss said it was installed Saturday afternoon by his conservative student club, which is affiliated with the College Republican National Committee and Young Americans for Freedom, the latter of which helped sponsor the  Never Forget  memorial project.Later that night Bliss said he learned bandits had uprooted and tossed the flags. When Bliss and his friend arrived at the scene, it was 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning. The three students who told Bliss the display is triggering denied involvement in the vandalism, he said.Campus safety was called and officers took statements from Bliss as well as the other three students.Meanwhile, Bliss added, as word spread on social media that the  Never Forget  memorial was razed, students left their dorm rooms in the middle of the night to help replant the flags. As students came home from parties, they chipped in, too. They were just like,  I am not Republican, I am not conservative, but this is a terrible act,  Bliss said.  They stayed there late into the night, 2 a.m., planting flags. It was pretty amazing, it was pretty touching. A Facebook post from the club offers more details on the long evening:  Later that morning, a few of us stood guard at the memorial. Four Occidental students came up and snapped a few flags right in our faces. When we confronted them, those cowards got away as fast as they possibly could. When Bliss (pictured) and his friends returned to the display after breakfast Sunday morning, he said he found another 100 flags trashed. And again, Bliss and his peers replanted.Bliss, 20, co-founder and president of the club, which he alanblisslaunched in the spring of 2016, said he plans to fight back.

Trump says Mexico has taken advantage of U.S. 'for long enough',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of Mexico on Friday, saying it “has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough,” as a crisis over border security and trade deepened. “Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change NOW!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned trip to Washington to meet Trump, who has repeatedly demanded that Mexico pay for a wall on the U.S. border to halt illegal immigration.      The White House also suggested on Thursday that the United States could impose a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for the wall, sending the peso tumbling. Speaking about the scrapped summit, senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway on Friday told Fox News that “the relationship was not imploded. This one meeting has been canceled and that was a mutual cancellation.” In a separate interview on CBS News, she said the tax was one funding possibility and waved off the chance of Mexican retaliation that could cost American jobs, telling CBS News: “They can do what they want.” “Mexico should pay for that wall because they get an awful lot from this country,” Conway told CBS. The White House has said its tax proposal is in the early stages.  A plan being weighed by House Republicans would exempt export revenues from taxation but impose a 20 percent tax on imported goods. The idea, known as a border adjustment tax, would be a significant change from current U.S. policy. Retailers and other businesses that sell imported goods are not keen on the idea, and some lawmakers have expressed concern about its impact on U.S. consumers.  “The costs for everything from groceries, to cars, to office supplies would go up by 20 (percent), making it harder for middle class families to pay for things they need every day,”     Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.

"U.S. Air Force awards contracts to Boeing, Northrop for ICBM replacement","(Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force has awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system, the Pentagon said on Friday. Though the award for the new Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) comes amid rising tensions with North Korea, the Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging ICBM system and its nuclear cruise missiles as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. “The Minuteman III is 45 years old. It is time to upgrade,” Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in a statement on Monday. Northrop Grumman was awarded $328 million, and Boeing $349 million over the three-year contract. The relatively small award is a milestone that would allow Boeing and Northrop to continue parallel detailed development and prototyping for the Minuteman replacement. The Pentagon’s office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) has said the total could cost the United States $85 billion. The Air Force has estimated $62 billion. Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop and Boeing were all competing for the contract which is needed to perform the three-year technology maturation and risk reduction (TMRR) phase of Minuteman replacement. A Lockheed representative said the company was “disappointed” and looked “forward to a debrief about the selection.” Boeing’s Strategic Deterrence Systems Director, Frank McCall, said in a statement, “Since the first Minuteman launch in 1961, the U.S. Air Force has relied on our technologies for a safe, secure and reliable ICBM force.” Boeing provided the Minuteman III missile for the current ground-based nuclear ICBM system.  Northrop Grumman’s chief Wes Bush said in a statement, “We look forward to the opportunity to provide the nation with a modern strategic deterrent system that is secure, resilient and affordable.”  Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said, “We are moving forward with modernization of the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad.”  Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force was expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade. The United States plans to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimated the cost at $1 trillion over 30 years. “Our missiles were built in the 1970s. Things just wear out, and it becomes more expensive to maintain them than to replace them,” Wilson said. ",politicsNews,"August 21, 2017 ",1,2618
BIG MISTAKE? MASKED ANTIFA COWARDS Target KID ROCK’S DETROIT Concert Opening Of Little Caesars Arena Tonight,"Detroit s own Kid Rock will open the all-new Little Caesars Arena on Tuesday, Sept. 12, but a group is planning a rally outside of the arena ahead of his concert.The rally will take place from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. outside of the arena. The concert is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m.According to the Facebook event, the group plans to  rally against symbols of white supremacy and hate in our amazing city of Detroit. Kid Rock has previously used the Confederate Flag at his concerts, and in 2015, the National Action Network asked General Motors to stop sponsoring his tour over the use of the flag.At the time, General Motors found Kid Rock has not flown the Confederate Flag since around 2011.  WXYZStephen Henderson, the race-obsessed Editorial Page Editor of the Detroit Free Press had this to say about Kid Rock and the Illitches, who never gave up on the city of Detroit, and continued to throw tens of millions of dollars at new ventures, even when many of us in the suburbs believed they were wasting their money on a city that could never be resecutated:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem.Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his embarrassing attempts to shame the white man, that will help to keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well ",politics,"Sep 5, 2017",0,2252

"WIKILEAKS CLINTON CAMPAIGN EMAIL: Uneducated, “Unaware” Supporters Not As Easy To Manipulate As Before","Another stunning, arrogant slam against Hillary supporters by the Hillary campaign A Clinton campaign email released as part of the Wikileaks data dump earlier today talks about the need to maintain political power by producing  an unaware and compliant citizenry .The email was sent to Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta by former Clinton administration official Bill Ivy on March 13, 2016.Ivy was appointed Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts during Bill Clinton s second term. According to his bio, Ivy  is a trustee of the Center for American Progress (a Clinton campaign front), and was a Team Leader in the Barack Obama presidential transition. In the email, Ivy outlines the panic amongst some Democrats that Donald Trump s  celebrity politics  persona cannot be matched by Hillary, who is  not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold. Money isn t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we re off and running,  complains Ivy.Ivy wonders how Clinton can combat Trump s larger than life appeal, worrying that simply  defaulting to policy  won t work.  And as I ve mentioned, we ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry,  he writes. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking   and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging. To emphasize, Ivy admits that the left has  conspired  to  produce an unaware and compliant citizenry  but that they re not as easy to manipulate anymore and that this is a problem. He characterizes  unawareness  amongst the public as a positive thing for the Clinton campaign.Ivy ends the email by saying he will attend a Clinton fundraiser and that he fears,  we are all now trying to navigate a set of forces that cannot be simply explained or fully understood.

Transgender court hearing set amid fight over Trump nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday scheduled oral arguments in a major dispute on transgender rights for March 28, when the U.S. Senate is set to be in the midst of a political fight over President Donald Trump’s nominee to a vacant seat on the bench. By March, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate is likely to be deliberating on whether to approve Neil Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado, to the court. Where Gorsuch stands on social issues like transgender rights is likely to be a much-discussed question during the confirmation process. Republicans are hoping the Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearings and votes on the nomination by late March, paving the way for a vote in the full Senate the first week of April, before the chamber begins a two week spring recess, according to Senate aides. In the transgender case, in which the eight-justice court could be split 4-4 without a ninth vote, a Virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female-born transgender high school student from using the boys’ bathroom. The dispute involves a transgender student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school’s boys’ bathroom. At the heart of the case is the question of whether transgender people are covered by a ban on gender discrimination in education under federal law. The administration of former President Barack Obama said it was. The Trump administration has not yet weighed in. Until the Senate approves a nominee, the court remains one justice short following the February death of Antonin Scalia, which left it with four conservatives and four liberals. That raises the possibility of a 4-4 ruling that would leave in place the decision favoring Grimm by the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A 4-4 ruling would set no nationwide legal precedent. It is also possible that the court could rehear the case if Gorsuch is confirmed. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2017 ",1,2035
Syrian rebel groups reject Russian-sponsored Sochi conference,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebel groups on Monday rejected Russia s planned Sochi conference on Syria, saying Moscow was seeking to bypass a U.N.-based Geneva peace process and blaming Russia for committing war crimes in the war-torn country. In a statement by around 40 rebel groups who include some of the military factions who participated in earlier rounds of Geneva peace talks, they said Moscow had not put pressure on the Syrian government to reach a political settlement.  Russia has not contributed one step to easing the suffering of Syrians and has not pressured the regime that it claims it is a guarantor by move in any real path towards a solution,  the rebel statement said. Russia, which has emerged as the dominant player in Syria after a major military intervention over two years ago, received backing from Turkey and Iran for holding a Syrian national dialogue congress in the Russian city of Sochi on Jan. 29-30.  Russia is an aggressor country that has committed war crimes against Syrians... It stood with the regime militarily and defended its politically and over seven years preventing U.N. condemnation of (Syrian President Bashar) Assad s regime,  the statement said. Moscow says it targets militants but rebels and residents say the Russian air strikes conducted since a major aerial campaign over two years ago has caused hundreds of civilian casualties in indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas away from the frontline. Some rebels said they had not yet made up their mind. U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said that Russia s plan to convene the congress should be assessed by its ability to contribute to and support the U.N.-led Geneva talks on ending the war in Syria.

Catalan separatists take to the streets ahead of referendum,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Demonstrators calling for Catalan independence gathered in hundreds of towns across the region on Sunday following Madrid s actions last week to try to block a referendum on self rule that it considers illegal. Spanish police have arrested Catalan officials who were involved in organizing the Oct. 1 vote and they also seized electoral material, including ballot papers and ballot boxes. This led to several days of protests in Barcelona. But Carles Puigdemont, the head of the Catalan regional government, has said the referendum will go ahead. Several thousand protesters gathered in central Barcelona on Sunday chanting  We will vote!  and handing out ballot papers. The crowds began whistling and booing a police helicopter during speeches by the protest organizers, showing growing anger among the referendum supporters about the increased police presence. Between 3,000 and 4,000 state police officers from other regions of Spain have arrived or are on their way to Catalonia.  We feel occupied by the Spanish police,  56-year-old interior designer Nuria Gimenez said.  We ve been protesting for 10 years, we re not going to stop now with one week to go. We need to keep going until the end.  On Saturday, the state prosecutor in Catalonia told all local and national police forces they would be placed temporarily under a single chain of command and report directly to the interior ministry in Madrid. The Catalan government initially said it would refuse the order, though the head of the Catalan regional police, known as the Mossos d Esquadra, later said he would comply with prosecutors. Speaking to the crowd in Barcelona, president of the Catalan Parliament Carme Forcadell said that separatists must resist  provocations  by the central government.  They see violence in Catalonia. There has been none, nor will there be. We are a peaceful people and all we want is to exercise our rights,  Forcadell said.  Although polls show less than half of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want self-rule, most in the wealthy northeastern region want the chance to vote on the issue.

President Trump to attend Paris July 14 celebrations,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will travel to France for the Bastille Day military celebrations on July 14, President Emmanuel Macron’s office said on Wednesday, in a sign the allies are seeking to bolster ties despite differences over climate change. The French presidency and White House said Trump had accepted an invitation to make the visit, which will also commemorate the U.S. entry into World War One 100 years ago.  “The two leaders will further build on the strong counter-terrorism cooperation and economic partnership between the two countries,” the White House said in a statement.  Macron appears to be broadly aligning his foreign policy with U.S. priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with Russia. But the two leaders publicly clashed after Trump said he would pull out of a global accord on action to combat climate change. “Beyond our differences on some subjects such as climate, it shows the strength and the links in our transatlantic ties and the convergence of views on counter-terrorism and our joint commitment in war zones,” said a French diplomat. After the United States, France is the biggest contributor to the coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The July 14 festivities see thousands of men and women from France’s army, navy and air force march down the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris. The U.S. military will this year march with French forces.  On July 14, 1789, crowds stormed the Bastille prison, where opponents of the monarchy were held, at the start of the French Revolution. Plans by Trump to visit Britain have yet to be finalised despite an invitation by Prime Minister Theresa May when she met him in Washington in January. The prospect of a visit has met opposition in Britain, prompting fears of angry protests, also a possibility in France. “Donald Trump is violent and there’s no reason for him being here,” a far-left lawmaker and former French presidential candidate said on Wednesday. “He is not welcome.

Trump sued in Kentucky by three who say he incited crowd to violence,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Three people who claim they were assaulted at a Donald Trump rally in Louisville, Kentucky, last month have filed a lawsuit against the Republican presidential candidate, saying he “incited a riot.” Molly Shah, Kashiya Nwanguma and Henry Brousseau filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Jefferson Circuit Court in Louisville, claiming that Trump’s repeated calls of “get them out” at a rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center on March 1 was intended to direct his supporters to “use unwanted, harmful physical force to remove protesters, including the plaintiffs.” The lawsuit also names as defendants the Trump campaign and three individuals who the plaintiffs claim assaulted them at the rally. The three plaintiffs, all Louisville residents, claim they suffered physical injuries, emotional distress and humiliation, and are seeking unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit. “Peaceful protest is an American tradition, especially in the context of presidential politics,” Dan Canon, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told Reuters in a Twitter message. “But what you see all over the country, time and time again, is violence employed against protesters at Trump campaign events. These plaintiffs are saying ‘enough is enough,’”  The lawsuit said Trump stopped his 30-minute speech five times to point out protesters and, in most cases, told supporters to “get ‘em out of here,” according to the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign could not be reached for comment. The lawsuit claims that Trump “incited a riot as defined under the Kentucky penal code.” The individuals named as defendants are Matthew Heimbach, described in the complaint as a Trump supporter and Ohio resident who is “affiliated with the Traditionalist Worker Party, a recognized hate group”; Alvin Bamberger, 75, described as a Trump supporter and an Ohio resident; and an unknown female. According to the lawsuit, at the rally, Heimbach, who was wearing a Traditionalist Worker Party T-shirt, attacked Shah and Nwanguma. A spokesman for the Traditional Worker Party could not be reached. A website for the Traditionalist Worker Party describes it as a grassroots political organization that believes, among other things, that “European-American identity is under constant attack.” The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit organization that monitors groups it considers extremist, classifies the Traditionalist Worker Party as a white nationalist hate group. According to the lawsuit, Nwanguma was assaulted by numerous protesters at the rally, of whom Heimbach and Bamberger were the most aggressive. Video of Nwanguma, a 21-year-old college student, being repeatedly pushed at the convention went viral after the rally, the lawsuit said. Bamberger could not be reached immediately for comment. The lawsuit also claims that Shah was assaulted by Heimbach and that Brousseau was assaulted by the unknown female defendant. ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1,3015

His IQ, or at least his communication skills, are below that of your average 5th grader and in fewer than four months, he has racked up more scandals than any President in history, On the governing front, we ll he s been the anti-Obama there too. He s trying to overturn every single Obama accomplishment, including Michelle s efforts at ensuring that poor children receive at least some nutrition at school, which for Republicans, is a step too far.Now, the Trump administration is putting a stop to those evil healthy lunches. Agriculture Secretary Sunny Perdue is delaying requirements for schools to have reduced sodium in lunches and he is issuing waivers so schools won t have to serve whole grains. Yes, depriving children of healthy lunches is petty and petulant, but that s the way the Trump administration rolls, so Michelle Obama weighed in.Speaking at an annual health conference in Washington, D.C., Obama said more nutritious school lunches are important since millions of kids eat federally subsidized school breakfast and lunch. Without mentioning President Donald Trump, she said parents should stop and  think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. If we want to make this country great, our kids need to be healthy,  Obama said.  Not some, but all.

Judge blocks Kansas' attempt to cut Planned Parenthood from Medicaid,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Kansas Governor Sam Brownback’s efforts to remove Planned Parenthood, a U.S. women’s healthcare and abortion provider, from a government health insurance program for the poor in the state. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson issued the 54-page order for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, ruling the state could not cancel Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, or PPKM, and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, or PPSLR. “It is uncontroverted that PPKM and PPSLR serve hundreds of underprivileged women in the State of Kansas,” Robinson said in the order. “It is in the public interest to allow these individuals to be treated by the qualified provider of their choice, and to have that provider reimbursed under Medicaid pending a trial on the merits in this case.” The Republican governor ordered state officials to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates through the state Medicaid program in January, saying the state would not fund an industry that disrespected life. A spokeswoman for Brownback said in a statement on Tuesday: “The governor will continue the fight to make Kansas a pro-life state. We will review today’s preliminary ruling and move forward with the litigation.” The state sought to cut funding after the release of videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group that activists said showed that Planned Parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue. Neither of the Planned Parenthood affiliates involved in the case participates in fetal tissue donation or sale, court records show. “We are thrilled with the judge’s ruling. We felt strongly that we were going into this on the right side of the law,” said Laura McQuade, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, formerly Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri. The two organizations, along with three of their patients who are on Medicaid, sued the state in May, arguing Brownback’s order would break federal law and violate the U.S. Constitution. Planned Parenthood has denied taking any illegal payments, calling the videos distortions of fetal-tissue donations. The organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs, which are legal under U.S. law. Planned Parenthood said in May that at least two dozen states had cut or tried to slash funding to its clinics since the mid-2015 release of the undercover videos.

 WATCH: Wolf Blitzer Makes Republican Throw Temper Tantrum Over Trump’s Nazi Problem,"The media needs to keep grilling Republicans over Donald Trump s flirtation with Nazis, because it s clearly a sore spot.When RNC communications director Sean Spicer appeared on CNN with Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday night, he was apparently hoping for a softball interview.But Blitzer had other ideas and soon called out Trump for being quick to whine and condemn the diverse cast of  Hamilton  while being very slow to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists.Blitzer wanted to know why Trump won t just deliver a speech openly condemning these deplorable groups. Spicer responded by saying that,  At some point, you ve gotta take his position and move on! Spicer said that Trump merely mentioning a disavowal should be enough and that he has  made his position clear,  but the problem is that Trump hasn t made it clear. Every time he claims to disavow these groups he ends up blowing them a kiss by sharing their tweets or supporting a policy that they support. In fact, these groups have become so emboldened by Trump that hate crimes have spiked since Election Day.Nazis and white supremacists are celebrating in the streets because they think Trump is the second coming of Hitler and that it will be open season on minorities across the country.Blitzer asked why these groups still support Trump even though he  disavowed  them, and Spicer threw a hissy fit. I don t know!  he snapped.  That s really not my focus, figuring out why certain groups support him! Blitzer pointed out that Trump has failed to condemn these groups unlike his consistent attacks on diverse groups like the cast of  Hamilton  for just merely passing on a message to Mike Pence.And Blitzer s persistence cause Spicer to lose his shit. You ve asked me eight times, the same question! I ve told you what his position is. That s not his focus! His focus is making this country better for all Americans, creating a better country, creating a better education system for all Americans, rebuilding our inner cities. That s what his focus is. So I get that you guys all want to ask the same question over and over again and make him denounce it eight ways to Sunday, but it s not what he wants to talk about! Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks are at the 4:30 mark.The reason why these groups still support Trump is because his condemnation of them has been weak from the very beginning, so it seems like Trump is only saying the minimum to make it sound like he condemns them. What Trump needs to do is deliver a speech to the entire country making it clear once and for all that he strongly condemns these groups and that he does not share their views nor will he help them pursue their hateful agenda.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 23, 2016",0,2799
 Sandy Hook Mom SHREDS Megyn Kelly For Interviewing Conspiracy Nut Alex Jones (TWEETS),"Megyn Kelly may have departed Fox News for more legitimate pastures at NBC, but she s no less of a right-wing hack. If anything, she s openly doing Donald Trump s bidding from her new anchor chair. Case in point   Kelly decided to bring fringe conspiracy nut Alex Jones in for an interview. This is the same guy who says the mass shooting of more than 20 innocent small children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut is a government hoax that used child actors to fool the world in order to promote gun control.Well, the mother of one of the victims of that very same shooting took Kelly to the woodshed for legitimizing Jones. Nelba Marquez-Greene took to Twitter and ripped Kelly apart:Hey @megynkelly , let me know if you want to give his victims equal air time. Promoting this fool is bad news. Do not encourage his abuse. https://t.co/WTJjFuSSuG  Nelba M rquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017To give a man like this such a platform normalizes behavior that isn't normal.

Papua New Guinea court rejects bid to restore services to asylum-seeker camp,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea s Supreme Court rejected an application on Tuesday to restore water, electricity and food supplies to an  Australian-run detention center for asylum seekers where nearly 600 men have been barricaded for a week. The men in the remote Manus Island facility have defied attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea to close the camp, refusing to move to three transit centers despite having little food or drinking water. Dozens of them also need medical help, three asylum seekers said, in a stand-off that the United Nations has described as a  looming humanitarian crisis .  The men have repeatedly said they would not move to the transit camps because they feared PNG residents on the island may attack, or that the will be resettled elsewhere in PNG or another developing nation. The court rejected the challenge on behalf of one of the detainees because it said power, water and food were available at the three transit centers, Ben Lomai, a lawyer for the detainee who lodged the application, told Reuters. Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher for rights group Amnesty International, warned conditions could deteriorate  catastrophically .  The lives of these men, who are only asking for their rights to dignity and safety, are at serious risk,  Schuetze said in a statement. The men, who include asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Syria, were last given food on Oct. 29 and have been relying on sporadic aid from Manus island locals and rainwater. Several of the detainees told Reuters Papua New Guinea s navy had blocked access for islanders trying to deliver supplies in the past few days. Representatives for Papua New Guinea Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas did not respond immediately to a request for comment about the claim. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who has been detained on Manus island for more than four years, said 90 of the men were sick and required  urgent  medical treatment.  They have infection, stomach ache and diarrhea because of dirty water,  Boochani told Reuters. Despite the conditions, several of the men said they would continue to defy efforts to get them to leave, frustrating Australia s attempts to close one of two controversial detention centers it uses to detain asylum seekers who arrive by boat. The Manus island camp, and another on the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru, have been the cornerstones of Australia s controversial immigration policies, which has been strongly criticized by the United Nations and rights groups. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said before the court ruling on Tuesday the men were only refusing to move to the new transit centers on the encouragement of advocates.   There are alternative facilities available of a very high quality with food and all of the facilities,  Turnbull told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.  The relocation of the men is designed to give the United States time to complete vetting of candidates as part of a refugee swap deal that Australia hopes will see it no longer responsible for the detention of nearly 1,400 asylum seekers who have been classified as refugees. Turnbull negotiated the deal with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year. Under the deal, Australia will accept refugees from Central America.     ",worldnews,"November 7, 2017 ",1,3413
South Africa's Zuma rejects reports his office is drafting emergency laws,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma has rejected local news reports that his office has started drafting regulations for a state of emergency, the president s office said on Tuesday. Emergency laws were last deployed in parts of Africa s most industrialized economy in 1985 under former president P.W. Botha, the face of white South Africa as president at the height of the anti-apartheid struggle.   The Presidency rejects the media reports alleging that The Presidency has started composing draft regulations for a state of emergency and that President Jacob Zuma has appointed a team to draw up such regulations,  Zuma s office said in a statement.  The Presidency is not working on regulations for a state of emergency.    Emergency powers have not been used in South Africa since the country s 1994 transition to multi-racial democracy after decades of white apartheid rule. The Rapport newspaper had reported that Zuma had ordered that regulations for a state of emergency be prepared to be part of the State of Emergency Act passed in 1997. The newspaper said the detailed regulations that would outline what should happen during a state of emergency were never passed into law when the main legislation was enacted. It cited documents showing that Zuma had set up a team to make the draft regulations. According to Rapport  the draft regulations would ban anyone from writing  publishing or broadcasting threatening material and give security forces power to use as much force as necessary to restore law and order.

"Rubio warms to Trump, but won't be his vice president","WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Sunday ruled out becoming Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, but said he’d be “honored” to play some kind of a role in helping him win the White House. Rubio, who clashed bitterly with Trump in the brutal race for the Republican nomination, said his policy differences with the real estate mogul were too great for Rubio to join the ticket. “I wouldn’t be the right choice for him,” Rubio said in an extensive interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “Donald deserves to have a vice president - he’s earned the nomination - and he deserves to have a running mate that more fully embraces some of the things he stands for.” Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, ended his White House bid in March after an embarrassing loss in his home state. Trump, who has practically ensured he will emerge as the nominee from the Republican convention in July, derided Rubio as a lightweight and dubbed him “Little Marco.”  Rubio called the real estate mogul a con artist and quipped about his small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood. Rubio and Trump differed sharply on policy issues, with Trump eschewing the interventionist approach favored by Rubio and Rubio criticizing Trump’s call for temporarily banning the entry of Muslims into the United States. Ahead of the July 18-21 Republican convention, Trump has sought to unify the party behind him and gain the backing of other prominent party figures. Rubio said he expected to attend the convention and did not rule out a speaking role. He said he wanted to be helpful to Trump’s presidential run because he wants to see likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton defeated in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. “I don’t want Hillary Clinton to be president. If there’s something I can do to help that from happening and it’s helpful to the cause I’d most certainly be honored to be considered for that,” Rubio said. In another olive branch to Trump, Rubio said he regretted making the “small hands” remark about his former foe. “I actually told Donald at one of the debates. I forget which one - I apologized to him for that,” Rubio said. “I said ‘I’m sorry that I said that.’ It’s not who I am. And I shouldn’t have done it.” ",politicsNews,"May 29, 2016 ",1,2350
" Kid Rock Just Had His First Political Rally, And It Was Worse Than You’d Imagine (VIDEO)","Robert Ritchie, AKA Kid Rock, has shown quite a bit of interest in running for the Senate in Michigan over the last few months, which would pit him against incumbent Democrat Debbie Stabenow.

One of the first occured at a show on September 6 at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a performance that had already garnered it s share of criticism and protesters before it even began, due to the artist s history of using the Confederate flag as a prop, something Rock has tried to justify as  Southern pride,  despite the fact he hails from Detroit. Yes, this is a man who is considering running for office.Kid Rock opened the night s performance with a new track entitled  Greatest Show on Earth and then the entire arena went dark. A campaign banner was projected on a screen and a voice announced over the public address system  Ladies and gentleman, will you please welcome the next senator of the great state of Michigan, Kid motherf___ing Rock.  Red, white and blue lights came back on and Rock made his way on to the stage and settled behind a lectern with a parody of the presidential seal that read  United States of  Merica  while  Hail to the Chief  played in the background.What followed was completely surreal as Rock stood at the podium, flanked by two women resplendent in white business shirts and hot-pants, and rhymed his way through an offensive, expletive-laden speech that, in comparison, made Donald Trump seem as reserved as a kindergarten teacher during his presidential campaign and, really, was a speech only Kid Rock could deliver. Rock covered all of the hot topics over the following four minutes between periodic bursts of guitars and thrusting, touching on sensitive issues such as health care and racism, while also calling out single mothers that rely on government assistance and white supremacists. He even went as far as considering the possibility of being President, pondering the potential of being able to grab his own junk while addressing the nation!Watch the madness that was Kid Rock s rant unfold here, however, a word of warning, there is quite a bit of coarse language.

OBAMA SIDEKICK VALERIE JARRETT In Hot Water Over Speaking Fee At Broke Public University,"Remember when Valerie Jarrett signed with a Hollywood talent agency? Well, we think she thinks she s a BIG deal now. How do we know? She charges $30K to speak! Who would pay a penny to hear this commie speak?A college in her hometown would pay this except they re going broke!That s a whopper of a bill for a university in her hometown that s going broke. There was an outcry when is was discovered that she would speak and charge $30K. Someone came forward to donate the fee but wouldn t it have been a great move on her part to donate the money to the failing university?Valerie Jarrett found herself in hot water in her adopted hometown for agreeing to take a $30,000 speaking fee from a public university that s going broke, a new report said Tuesday.President Obama s longtime adviser and confidante eventually waived the fee for delivering a commencement address at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago after an outcry over the hefty payment, Politico reported.The university shut down over spring break and also announced unpaid furlough days for staffers, the most recent in a string of measures taken to fight financial woes caused by a lengthy partisan state budget debate.The Chicago Sun-Times first reported the details in Jarrett s contract, and that a private donor agreed to pay her fee once university leaders raised objections. While keenly aware of the financial challenges in Illinois, we were not aware of the specific issues facing Northeastern Illinois University or that a donor would be paying for the speaking fee,  Amy Brundage, a Jarrett spokeswoman, told Politico. Jarrett notified [University] President [Richard] Helldobler this morning that she will not be accepting a speaking fee for the commencement address. Jarrett looks forward to addressing the graduates and other members of the NEIU community next month. NEIU board members were not amused about the deal paying so much for a speaker at a time the school is cutting programs and struggling to survive.Read more: NYP",Government News,"Apr 11, 2017",0,2100

" MSNBC Reacts To Melissa Harris-Perry’s Letter, And Their Response Is Shameful","Just days after Melissa Harris-Perry wrote a scathing indictment of MSNBC s willful shift away from powerful and necessary opinions to that of just generic news, the network has responded.Perry wrote a letter that was released through one of her original producers of her show that explained what she was parting ways with the network. She wrote: Here is the reality: our show was taken without comment or discussion or notice in the midst of an election season. After four years of building an audience, developing a brand, and developing trust with our viewers, we were effectively and utterly silenced. Now, MSNBC would like me to appear for four inconsequential hours to read news that they deem relevant without returning to our team any of the editorial control and authority that makes MHP Show distinctive. She left the window open, however, to MSNBC if they wanted to pull their heads out of their asses, that she may return. She wrote at the end of her letter: While MSNBC may believe that I am worthless, I know better. I know who I am. I know why MHP Show is unique and valuable. I will not sell short myself or this show. I am not hungry for empty airtime. I care only about substantive, meaningful, and autonomous work. When we can do that, I will return not a moment earlier. I am deeply sorry for the ways that this decision makes life harder for all of you. You mean more to me than you can imagine. However, it looks as though MSNBC now wants absolutely nothing to do with her and has cut all ties because Harris-Perry had the audacity to do what she does best, voice her opinion. MSNBC executives have now said: She s a brilliant, intelligent but challenging and unpredictable personality There was no plan to cancel her. But adding: It s highly unlikely she will continue  [because her email] is destructive to our relationship. According to WaPo: This executive disputed Harris-Perry s assertion that MSNBC executives had not communicated with her, although he said Harris-Perry has never met Andrew Lack, the NBC News chairman who was rehired by the network last year after the controversy over Williams. The decision to preempt Harris-Perry s program for election-news coverage over the past several months was made by MSNBC s president, Phil Griffin. All in all, MSNBC is blaming Harris-Perry for her own departure. She wasn t willing to bend over backwards to fulfill a narrative set by a company desperate for ratings, and because she had the courage to stand up against it, she s getting punished for having a voice of her own. It s sad, really. Melissa Harris-Perry was a necessary and powerful progressive voice that often brought up subjects all too many others are afraid to bring up. She will be missed.Featured image: YouTube",News,"February 28, 2016",0,2836
Factbox: Women who have alleged inappropriate conduct by Trump,"(Reuters) - Several women have accused U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual advances and groping. Among his accusers are a Miss Utah beauty pageant winner, a businesswoman, a reporter and a receptionist. He has denied the accusations. In a 2005 video that emerged on Oct. 7, Trump boasted about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without their consent. In a U.S. presidential debate on Oct. 9, he said he was embarrassed by what he called locker-room talk but had not engaged in the conduct he described in the video.  Trump has called “absolutely false” allegations by several women of groping and other misconduct, reported by The New York Times and other media. He has called the women “sick,” and at Wednesday night’s final presidential debate, he alleged that the women were either controlled by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton’s campaign or seeking “their 10 minutes of fame.”  Following are some of the allegations against Trump:  Jill Harth Houraney, a former Trump beauty pageant business associate, filed a $125 million lawsuit in 1997 against Trump alleging that on Jan. 24, 1993, at Trump’s Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump “forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant subjected plaintiff to defendant’s unwanted sexual advances.” A Trump representative was quoted on Oct. 7 in The New York Times as saying, “Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth.” The lawsuit was dropped in May 1997. Temple Taggart McDowell, a former Miss Utah, was quoted by The New York Times in a report published on May 15 as saying that Trump “kissed me directly on the lips” when the two were introduced in 1997, when she was 21. Taggart told the Times, “I thought, ‘Oh my God, gross.’” The Times story said Trump disputed the report and added that Trump said “he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips.” Jessica Leeds, 74, recounted in an video interview posted on The New York Times website on Oct. 12 that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to New York in or around 1980 when she was a 38-year-old traveling businesswoman. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication. Rachel Crooks, formerly a receptionist at a real estate firm, told The New York Times in a report published on Oct. 12   that Trump “kissed me directly on the mouth” in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan when she was 22. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication. Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter, wrote a first-person account that described Trump kissing her without her consent in December 2005 at Trump’s Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, while she was working on an article about him and his third wife, Melania, for People magazine. In the account published by People on Oct. 12, Stoynoff said “he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.” In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump said the episode described did not happen. Mindy McGillivray was cited in an article published in The Palm Beach Post on Oct. 12 that while she was a 23-year-old   photographer’s assistant at a Jan. 24, 2003, event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump had grabbed her buttocks. The Palm Beach Post cited a Trump spokesperson as saying, “This allegation lacks any merit or veracity.” Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on Trump’s reality TV show “The Apprentice” in 2006, said at a news conference on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas that Trump tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him when she met him in 2007 to discuss a possible job. Zervos said she complied with a request to sit next to Trump, and, “He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast.” Trump at a rally in North Carolina this month denounced the allegations made by a series of women, calling them fabrications. Kristin Anderson, in a video posted on the website of The Washington Post on Oct. 14, said Trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded New York nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance, when she had never even met him. “He did touch my vagina through my underwear, absolutely,” Anderson said in the video interview. Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comments on the allegations at the time they were made public.   Yoga instructor Karena Virginia, at a news conference in New York City on Thursday, said Trump approached her outside the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1998. They had never met, and she was 27 years old, she said. She alleged that Trump commented on her legs and then touched her breast before she was able to get into a car and be driven away. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said the accusation was a publicity-seeking attack coordinated with Clinton, and added: “Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories.” ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1,4974
U.S. judge aims to quickly decide lawsuits over DACA,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday said he wanted to decide quickly lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s decision to end a program that shielded from deportation children brought to the United States illegally by their parents. President Donald Trump this month decided to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in March 2018. Since it was authorized in 2012 by President Barack Obama, the program has provided protection from deportation and the right to work legally to nearly 800,000 young people. Several states, organizations and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to protect DACA recipients known as Dreamers.  At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, U.S. District Judge William Alsup grouped four of those cases together, including a lawsuit filed by California’s attorney general and six individual Dreamers. Legal briefs for many of the issues could be finished by December, he said. “I don’t like the idea that we’re fiddling while Rome burns and then suddenly the program is expired,” Alsup said. The legal claims in all of the cases are similar: That the Trump administration did not follow proper administrative procedure in rescinding DACA, and that making enforcement promises to a group of people, only to revoke them, violates due process. The Trump administration has said it is ending DACA because Obama overstepped his constitutional authority when he bypassed Congress and created the DACA program unilaterally. Trump called on Congress to enact a law to protect DACA recipients and last week angered some of his fellow Republicans by negotiating with top congressional Democratic leaders on possible legislation.  During the 2016 presidential election, Trump ran on a hardline immigration platform, promising to end DACA and strengthen border protections to increase jobs for U.S. workers. Dreamers with work permits that expire before March can apply to renew them for another two years if they do so before Oct. 5. The Department of Homeland Security might extend that date. In court on Thursday, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate said the government still had not made a decision on the deadline.  Shumate also said the Trump administration has not changed Obama-era restrictions about when a Dreamer’s personal information can be shared with other agencies for immigration enforcement purposes.",politicsNews,"September 21, 2017 ",1,2453

Illinois abuse victim's lawsuit against ex-U.S. House speaker to proceed,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A sexual abuse victim will continue to try to collect $1.8 million from former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, the victim’s attorney said on Tuesday, after an Illinois judge denied Hastert’s motion to dismiss a breach-of-contract lawsuit.  The plaintiff, identified in court documents as James Doe, claims that Hastert agreed to pay him $3.5 million as compensation for decades of pain and suffering caused by Hastert’s sexual abuse. Hastert, 74, the longest-serving Republican U.S. House speaker in history, pleaded guilty last year to the crime of structuring, which involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection. Hastert has not been charged with or convicted of sex abuse due to the statute of limitations, but at his sentencing hearing in April, he admitted to sexual abuse of boys when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville, around 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Chicago.  Hastert was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison, followed by two years of probation and sex-offender treatment.  He is serving his sentence in the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota. Doe filed the lawsuit in Kendall County Circuit Court in northeastern Illinois in April, claiming Hastert owes him the unpaid portion of a $3.5 million deal they verbally agreed to in 2008.  “There is no public policy against an abuser agreeing to compensate his victim and the victim seeking to enforce that commitment to compensate him,” Kristi Browne, Doe’s attorney, said in a statement on Tuesday.  “We will proceed now to prove our claim by seeking documents from Mr. Hastert and others and taking his deposition.” Judge Robert Pilmer rejected Hastert’s motion to have the case dismissed on Monday and the decision was disclosed on  Tuesday, according to court documents. The plaintiff had established a basis for a “claim for contract,” Pilmer wrote in his order.  Hastert’s attorney did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Hastert’s attorney sought dismissal because the contract was not in writing, saying it would be void because Doe broke confidentiality by speaking about it, according to court documents  Doe said he was 14 when he was molested by Hastert, a trusted family friend, high school teacher and “beloved coach” of the state champion wrestling team in the town of Yorkville, Illinois, according to court documents. The next hearing in the contract case is scheduled for Jan. 18. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1,2553
" Here’s How Trump Is Going To F*CK Us Into WWIII, And It Doesn’t Actually Start In The Middle East","Has anybody ever wondered whether all these acts of war, including the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan, are just distractions from the growing Russia scandal? Considering the fact that he won t say whether he actually authorized the MOAB strike, it s not too far-fetched to wonder if this was to distract us from news that our intelligence community may have concrete information showing his campaign colluded with Russia during the election.But the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan may not be all. Trump is threatening North Korea, too, in a more direct way than saying,  See my giant penis bomb? You shouldn t mess with me. We already sent a strike force across the Pacific to intimidate Kim Jong Un, who s been shooting missiles into the Sea of Japan lately. North Korea is now talking about conducting a nuclear test within the next few days, and the Trump administration has threatened to hit them with Tomahawks if they do so.But that s not all   there may well be an attempt to get  boots on the ground  in North Korea as well:The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site.American heavy bombers are also positioned in Guam to attack North Korea should it be necessary, and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.The U.S. strike could include missiles and bombs, cyber and special operations on the ground.Because that s totally the way to cow a foreign power. North Korea has warned that if we launch a pre-emptive strike against them, they could launch a nuke at us. Hot air? Maybe. But it would be better for Trump to take it seriously than strut around with his penis peacock feathers on full display right up until they actually do it.If dropping the biggest non-nuclear bomb in our arsenal isn t enough to scare them, then nothing will be. If we launch missiles at North Korea in a pre-emptive strike for a nuclear test, we ve committed an act of war, and no matter how we justify it, we ve made ourselves a threat to the entire world by provoking a nuclear power.And North Korea may or may not retaliate directly against us. While they ve threatened to  hit the U.S. first,  with a nuke should we strike, they might decide to hit South Korea, or even Japan, in retaliation for such an attack. In fact, Japan is worried that North Korea could send missiles tipped with sarin gas warheads their way. Sarin gas is the gas that Assad used on his people last week.In other words, Trump s aggressive actions have consequences he doesn t seem to understand.

Turkish military says has begun reconnaissance in Syria's Idlib,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish armed forces began reconnaissance activities in Syria s Idlib province on Sunday, the military confirmed on Monday, before an expected military operation in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest. It said the move involved establishing observation points and that the military was conducting its duties in line with the rules of engagement agreed in the Astana process, referring to an agreement reached last month in the Kazakhstan capital. Turkey says it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed, aiming to implement a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands.

JUST DO IT! ALABAMA CONGRESSMAN Files One Sentence Bill To Repeal “Largest Welfare Plan By Republicans” [Video]," Effective as of December 31, 2017, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111 148) is repealed, and the provisions of law amended or repealed by such Act are restored or revived as if such Act had not been enacted. If the American people want to repeal Obamacare, this is their last, best chance during the 115th Congress,  Brooks said. Those Congressmen who are sincere about repealing Obamacare may prove it by signing the discharge petition. At a minimum, the discharge petition will, like the sun burning away the fog, show American voters who really wants to repeal Obamacare and who merely acts that way during election time,  he added.

Pentagon assesses readiness for transgender hires: memo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense is assessing its ability to recruit transgender people as soon as 1 July, according to a memo signed by a top Pentagon official and seen by Reuters. The Pentagon ended its ban on openly transgender people serving in the U.S. military last year under Defense Secretary Ash Carter. That repeal lowered one of the last barriers on who could serve in the military and came after a 2011 decision to end the U.S. military’s ban on openly gay and lesbian people. A Pentagon spokesperson verified the contents of the memo, but declined further comment on the document.  The memo instructed each military branch to examine their “readiness to begin assessing transgender applicants into military service on July 1, 2017.” In the memo, dated 8 May, Defense Secretary Robert Work instructed chiefs of each military branch and service secretaries to submit their reports by 31 May.

 Actress Salma Hayek Perfectly BURNS Trump For Confusing 9/11 With 7- Eleven (TWEET),"A tweet by actress Salma Hayek clearly demonstrates how ridiculous the Republican Party is for supporting Donald Trump.During a rally in Buffalo on Monday, the Republican front-runner didn t even notice a major slip of his tongue when he confused to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 to the convenience store known as 7-Eleven. I wrote this out, and it s very close to my heart,  Trump claimed.  Because I was down there and I watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11, down at the World Trade Center right after it came down. And I saw the greatest people I ve ever seen in action. Yeah, it s so close to his heart that he couldn t even be bothered to get the date of the attacks right. And he was in New York when he made the unforced error.Trump would end up being crucified on social media for the screw-up, but Salma Hayek won the Internet with her own hilarious reaction.

 This Kansas Republican Thought Touting ‘Profound’ Hitler Quote Was A Good Idea – It Wasn’t,"Republicans have a knack for making bad choices, but this one is a whopper. One Kansas Republican thought it would be a good idea to put a post on social media featuring a quote from Adolf Hitler that she deemed  profound. Speaker Pro Tem Peggy Mast, R-Emporia, who happens to also be the No. 3 Republican in the Kansas House, posted the offensive quote to her Facebook page.Great quote from Hitler in the video,  she wrote on Thursday morning, in a post that contained no video.  Please listen to it closely. His words are profound! Let s start using discernment. Christie Kriegshauser, House Speaker Ray Merrick s chief of staff, failed to follow Mast s line of thinking. Sorry, I m confused,  Kriegshauser wrote in response to her first post.  What video and how is there a great quote from Hitler? Although Mast did not return phone calls, she did take to Facebook yet again to, ahem, clarify what she meant by touting quotes from the leader of the Third Reich. She claimed that she  was not in any way agreeing with Hitler s words,  and was just trying to compare him to Planned Parenthood.About an hour later, she added a link to an article from JulieRoys.com, a Christian blog, to her Facebook page. The article contained a video of anti-abortion activist Gianna Jessen giving testimony to Congress regarding Planned Parenthood. In her testimony, Jessen quoted Hitler and argued that he used the same kind of propaganda as the women s health provider. The receptivity of the masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan,  Hitler said in the quote. Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, a group that fights against racism, was also unimpressed with Mast s post. There s nothing profound, and there s no room in American politics for the words or thought of Adolph Hitler,  Reiber said.In one of her Nazi-loving Facebook posts, Mast wrote:  To clarify the intent of my previous post: Planned Parenthood has learned well the same tactics and deception used by Hitler regarding innocent lives.   I was making a connection between the ideology he used and the arguments made by Planned Parenthood. In an email, Laura McQuade, president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes, wrote that Planned Parenthood  is a trusted health care provider for thousands of Kansans and we reject and condemn Representative Peggy Mast s offensive remarks. Thankfully, Mast is not running for re-election.Featured image via YouTube",News,"October 20, 2016",0,2810

Speaking to Channel 4 news, Khan felt Trump s out-of-context criticisms and continued attacks on Twitter meant that the U.K. should not  roll out the red carpet  for the president as  his policies go against everything we stand for. He added:  When you have a special relationship it is no different from when you have got a close mate. You stand with them in times of adversity but you call them out when they are wrong. There are many things about which Donald Trump is wrong.   Hollywood ReporterShouldn t London s government be more concerned with their current mayor s past than of President Trump s efforts to unify the world in the fight against extreme Islamic terrorism?In 2016, the now Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan was branded unfit to be London s Mayor after it emerged that he had described moderate Muslim groups as  Uncle Toms    a notorious racial slur used against black people to suggest that they are subservient to whites.The incendiary claim emerged in a 2009 interview with Iranian-backed Press TV, when Mr Khan was  minister for community cohesion , in charge of Government efforts to stamp out extremism.The revelation is a major blow for Mr Khan, who has faced a string of claims about his past dealings with Muslim extremists during the bitter campaign to succeed Boris Johnson.

Nah, I won t do that,  said Durant, the 2017 NBA Finals MVP.  I don t respect who s in office right now. Yesterday, Stephen Curry bragged about not visiting the White House.

Americans need to start turning off programs with controversial, race-obsessed hosts like Chris Hayes (who tweeted Curry s statement) and Trump-hating Jemele Hill who are more concerned about starting a race war in America than discussing sports.",politics,"Sep 23, 2017",0,2694
France invites U.S. to Dec. 13 summit on boosting fight against W.African militants,"ACCRA (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron fears Islamist militants have scored military and symbolic victories in West Africa while a regional military force has struggled to get off the ground, a French presidential source said on Thursday. To help get the new G5 Sahel force operating effectively, he said, France has invited the United States to a summit with the five participating countries as well as the African Union and European Union in Paris next month.  Thousands of U.N. peacekeepers, French troops and U.S. military trainers and drone operators have failed so far to stem a growing wave of jihadist violence, leading world powers to pin their hopes on the new G5 Sahel force. The G5 Sahel initiative - grouping Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger - faces an immense security challenge in a largely desert and weakly governed region and already faces questions over its financing and provision of equipment.  Emmanuel Macron believes that it s not going quickly enough and that the terrorists have registered military and symbolic victories, especially in Niger, and (that) it s urgent to reverse this trend,  the French official said in Ghana where Macron was winding up a three-day Africa trip.  The (objective) will be to accelerate the calendar for the support of the force, and the operational calendar.  The jihadist threat hit home again last month with an attack in Niger in which eight U.S. and Nigerien troops were killed, prompting American officials to forecast that U.S. involvement in the Sahel region would deepen. As well as the leaders of the G5 nations - all former French colonies - and the EU and African Union, the French presidential official said the United States had also been invited to the Dec. 13 summit. The G5 force is to eventually comprise 5,000 men from seven battalions and police the region in collaboration with 4,000 French troops deployed there since Paris intervened in 2013 to beat back an insurgency in northern Mali. It will also have to coordinate with MINUSMA, Mali s U.N. peacekeeping mission. MINUSMA has been frequently attacked in the north where Islamists have regained ground since 2013. A donor conference will be held in Brussels on Dec. 14 to raise funds for the Sahel force. Paris has also asked Saudi Arabia to help finance the force and representatives of the kingdom could also be in Paris on Dec. 13, the official said. ",worldnews,"November 30, 2017 ",1,2494

 Trump Gives PATHETIC Reason For Why He Sucked At Debate (TWEET),"If you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, you already know that Hillary Clinton pretty much wiped the floor with Donald Trump. Trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions. Let s just say that everyone noticed.Trump couldn t take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliation that is following the debate. While several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for Clinton, Trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would).The best excuse Trump has been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. The Associated Press has reported that after the debate, the GOP nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. And yet despite something being  wrong with it,  that mic seemed to work fine as he shouted over Hillary every few seconds. AP reported: Trump visited the media spin room after the Monday night debate and said,  They gave me a defective mic! He said he  wonder(s), was that on purpose? CBS s Sopan Deb also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into Trump s microphone conspiracy theory:TwitterTrump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! What a moron. The truth is that Trump didn t prepare for the debate like Clinton did   and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, it wouldn t have mattered much   he s completely unqualified for the White House. Last night, Hillary showed America that these two shouldn t even be up against each other. There is no comparison. Hillary looked like our next President, and Trump looked like a fraud and an imposter who should have never made it up on that stage.I wouldn t be surprised if Trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromised last night.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016",0,2173
U.S. calls for U.N. action against Iran over Yemen missile,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States accused Iran on Tuesday of supplying Yemen s Houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into Saudi Arabia in July and called for the United Nations to hold Tehran accountable for violating two U.N. Security Council resolutions.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said information released by Saudi Arabia showed the missile fired in July was an Iranian Qiam, which she described as  a type of weapon that had not been present in Yemen before the conflict.  Saudi-led forces, which back the government in neighboring Yemen, have been targeting the Iran-allied Houthis in a more than two-year war. Saudi Arabia s crown prince on Tuesday described Iran s supply of rockets to the Houthis as  direct military aggression  that could be an act of war. Haley said that by providing weapons to the Houthis, Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp s had violated two U.N. resolutions on Yemen and Iran. She said a missile shot down over Saudi Arabia on Saturday  may also be of Iranian origin.       We encourage the United Nations and international partners to take necessary action to hold the Iranian regime accountable for these violations,  Haley said. It was not immediately clear what action the United States was calling for.  Saudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi echoed Haley s call for U.N. action against Iran in a letter to the U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres later on Tuesday, seen by Reuters.  He said the missile fired on Saturday  may amount to a war crime  and that Saudi Arabia was  taking appropriate measures to respond to these terrorist acts.  Iran s U.N. Ambassador Gholamali Khoshroo also wrote to the Security Council and Guterres on Tuesday, rejecting the accusations by Saudi Arabia as  baseless and unfounded.   Iran calls for self-restraint and wisdom instead of provocation and threat that may bring further instability to this already volatile region,  Khoshroo wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters.  Under a U.N. resolution that enshrines the Iran nuclear deal with world powers, Tehran is prohibited from supplying, selling or transferring weapons outside the country unless approved in advance by the U.N. Security Council. A separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, two Houthi commanders, Yemen s former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, his son, and  those acting on their behalf or at their direction.  The United States could propose people or entities to be blacklisted by the Security Council s Yemen sanctions committee, a move that would need consensus approval by the 15-members.  Or it could put forward a new Security Council resolution to impose sanctions on Iran. To pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia. ",worldnews,"November 7, 2017 ",1,2932
"McCain vows to block proposed separation of NSA, cyber command","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Tuesday he would use his power to block the confirmation of a key cybersecurity official if necessary to prevent any Obama administration move to separate the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency. “I do not believe rushing to separate the ‘dual hat’ in the final months of an administration is appropriate, given the very serious challenges we face in cyberspace,” McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a hearing. “Dual hat” refers to one individual holding both positions. Current and former U.S. officials told Reuters in August that President Barack Obama’s administration was preparing to elevate the stature of the Department of Defense’s Cyber Command, including separating it from the NSA.  Officials argued that the focus of the NSA, a spy agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, is gathering intelligence, often favoring the monitoring of an enemy’s cyber activities.  Cyber Command’s mission is geared more to shutting down cyber attacks - and, if ordered, counter attacking. McCain said the two agencies must work closely together to protect U.S. national security and he would block any nominee if that person was not nominated both to run the NSA and lead Cyber Command. He also said he wanted the administration to provide his panel with detailed plans of its proposed reorganization. “This committee does not take well to being stonewalled while their colleagues in the administration leak information to the press,” McCain said. Admiral Mike Rogers, the current NSA director and head of Cyber Command, told the hearing that he did not think it was in the best U.S. national security interest at this point to separate the two functions.

Turkey issues detention orders for 53 soldiers over Gulen links: Anadolu,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish prosecutor has issued detention warrants for 53 active sergeants over alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric accused of orchestrating last year s attempted coup, state media said on Tuesday. Twenty of the suspects have so far been detained in the operation across 12 provinces, state run Anadolu Agency said. Thirty-three other soldiers were currently being sought, it said. The interior ministry said on Monday that nearly 700 people had been detained over the previous week on allegations of ties to what Ankara calls the  Gulenist Terror Group . Some 50,000 people have been arrested since the failed putsch in July and around 150,000 dismissed or suspended, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with the movement of U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied the charge and condemned the coup. Rights groups and some Western allies fear President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to stifle dissent. The government argues the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt, which killed 240 people on July 15, 2016. ",worldnews,"November 7, 2017 ",1,1263
" Cliven Bundy Takes Charge Of Remaining Oregon Militiamen, Says They Will Continue Occupation Indefinitely","With his son Ammon Bundy in jail with most of the the militants who had been occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, Cliven Bundy has decided to take matters into his own hands. In a letter addressed to the authorities responsible for the arrests of many of the militants and the death of one, Cliven Bundy says that the folks still occupying the refuge will fight to the death. The letter read, in part: This is notice that We the People of Harney County and also We the People of the citizens of the United States DO GIVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL RETAIN POSSESSION OF THE HARNEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER. Harney County Resource Center  is the name the militants have given to the refuge in place of its original name.The letter was posted to the Bundy Ranch Facebook page, in full:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Notice to Harney Co. Sheriff.Share share share ..Posted by Bundy Ranch on Monday, February 1, 2016This stunt shows that Bundy is even more of an idiot than his son, who had requested that the occupation end after the arrests and after the death of LaVoy Finicum. Bundy said to the media during an interview: What this is saying is that Cliven Bundy is taking control of things. If we don t retain it, then we ve lost everything that we ve done in the last two months. We re not gonna give up. This is not Ammon s message. This is my message   We ve made a decision to retain it   The feds are going to get out of there. Remove all federal and state policing agents out of Harney County. So, with his son in jail along with the majority of supporters jailed as well, Cliven sees fit to make demands of all authorities. He also says that he does not believe that Ammon really wanted the occupation to end, but said that he did under duress: That s what he said, but I never believed it. I don t think that s what s in his heart. He probably got his arm twisted. Ammon Bundy s statement, however, seems to run contrary to what his father wants: To those who remain at the refuge, I love you. Let us take this fight from here   Please stand down. Go home and hug your families. This fight is ours for now, in the courts. The four who are left are choosing to remain, demanding that they not be prosecuted despite the huge number of crimes they have obviously committed.Bundy and all involved in emboldening this ridiculousness all need to go to jail for a long, long time, their demands be damned.

 Iowa Racist: I Beat That Man Because I’m ‘Allergic To Black People’ (VIDEO),"With the rise of Donald Trump, America s racists are coming out of the woodwork in droves. They are also becoming increasingly violent. Yet another incident of racist violence comes to us from Iowa City, Iowa, where a man wearing a surgical mask attacked a black man. Authorities were called to the scene due to a fight, only to find out it was a racist attack.The attacker, Andy Benavidez, 47, told police that the attack was racially motivated. Benavidez hurled racist epithets at his victim, all the while physically assaulting him. The most bizarre part of all was, of course, the surgical mask, and the suspect informed police that the reason for his wearing it was so that he wouldn t be contaminated by black people germs.Benavidez is facing assault charges for his crime, and thanks to the fact that he has admitted that he did it because he is a flaming racist, a hate crime charge will be attached as well.This sort of thing will only get worse as people are given cause to spew their hatred and lash out in violence.

Obama claims victory after drop in U.S. jobless rate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said Americans should feel good about the economy after the latest jobs report on Friday showed the U.S. unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. Obama, in his eighth and final year in office, made a relatively rare and unexpected appearance in the White House briefing room to talk about how the economy had recovered under his watch. “We have recovered from the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, the worst in my lifetime and the lifetime of most of the people in this room,” Obama said, noting the unemployment rate was 10 percent in 2009, when he took office. “We’ve done it faster, stronger, better, more durably than just about any other advanced economy,” Obama said. The White House has griped that Obama does not get enough credit for turning the economy around, a complaint Obama joked about on Thursday during a visit from the Golden State Warriors basketball champions. “You defied the cynics, you accomplished big things, you racked up a great record, and you don’t get enough credit - I can’t imagine how that feels,” Obama said, drawing laughter. On Friday, he acknowledged that “there’s still anxiety and concern about the general direction of the economy,” noting the job losses, stock market plunges and free fall in the housing market in 2007-2008 were still fresh in Americans’ memories. Obama said “softness” in China, Europe and other economies presented challenges to U.S. exporters and he said it was important for the United States to “keep our foot to the accelerator” to further strengthen the economy. “We should feel good about the progress we’ve made, understanding that we have still got more work to do,” he said, noting the budget he will propose to Congress on Tuesday will have ideas for job creation and retraining. Obama slammed Republican candidates in the race to replace him in the Nov. 8 presidential election for “talking down” the economy. “I know that’s still inconvenient for Republican stump speeches as their doom-and-despair tour plays in New Hampshire,” Obama said, referring to the primary election in the state on Tuesday.

One commentator at Bild, which has run a campaign to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers, wrote:  No wonder many people are worried and unsettled. They ask:  Can the state protect me?  Politicians must take this insecurity seriously.  The report, coinciding with official data showing the number of people seeking refuge in Germany more than doubled in the two years until the end of 2016 to 1.6 million, comes amid warnings that courts are overburdened by the sheer volume of applications. Voters punished Merkel for her open-door policy in a September election, with her conservatives suffering heavy losses to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), and migration policy now tops the agenda in coalition talks. Her conservative bloc has tried to paper over internal divisions on migrant policy but is still at odds with the Free Democrats (FDP) and especially the Greens with whom they want to rule. Plans to discuss the issue on Thursday were delayed. Points of contention include to what extent family members should be allowed to join asylum seekers in Germany and putting limits on the number of people who arrive. The Statistics Office said the 1.6 million people seeking refuge by the end of last year was a 113 percent jump from 2014 and equivalent to 16 percent of Germany s foreign population. Included in the figures are people from abroad staying in Germany for humanitarian reasons, people still going through the asylum process, those granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status and failed asylum seekers who stay. More than half of the 1.6 million people had by the end of 2016 been granted permission to stay in Germany while some 158,000 were rejected asylum seekers, said the Office. Some 455,000 of the total were from Syria.  According to data requested by the Linke party and seen by Reuters, refugees made 321,837 aslyum applications in German courts in the year to June 30, five times the volume in the same period last year.  The administrative courts are so heavily burdened that the current staff can not deal with the work in a timely manner,  Erich Mueller-Fritzsche, a member of the Federation of German Administrative Judges, told Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper. Although the number of new arrivals to Germany has fallen sharply in the last 18 months and the government has stepped up deportations of rejected asylum seekers, many Germans, worried about security, say better controls are needed.  We need to know who is in our country and who has left,  said conservative Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, known for taking a tough line on migrants.  Last year, a failed asylum seeker from Tunisia killed 12 people when he drove a truck into a Berlin Christmas Market. On Tuesday, a 19-year old Syrian man was detained on suspicion of planning a bomb attack in Germany. The AfD, continuing to put pressure on politicians on the migrant issue, criticized the southern state of Baden Wuerttemberg for accepting 34,000 Syrian refugees.   Although the war in Syria is as good as over, the regional government does not mind the asylum authorities continuing to let Syrians stay here,  said the regional AfD in a statement.

HOW OBAMA IS FORCING POOREST AMERICANS To Fend For Themselves Against Dangerous Criminals Crossing Our Borders,"Is it any wonder Latino Americans are throwing their support behind Donald Trump?Concerned about strange people running through their neighborhood at night, several Hidalgo residents invited a CBS 4 News reporter to stop by   and witness the problem firsthand.Note: Hidalgo is not even listed on the Top 8 Most Dangerous Border Cities In AmericaGraciela Perez said she s concerned about the people who attempt to sneak through her neighborhood every night.Depending on the day, 30 to 50 people pass through the Hidalgo Viejo neighborhood, Perez said. Dogs start barking, waking many residents. We think they are undocumented immigrants and we re scared,  Perez said.  Honestly, we re scared because of what s going on in Mexico.  Via: Valley CentralThe number of arrests made at the border of people from Afghanistan and Pakistan is up significantly this year compared to last, the president of the National Border Patrol Council said when he testified during a House hearing on Tuesday.Brandon Judd, who has also served as a Border Patrol agent for nearly 20 years, also told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee s Subcommittee on National Security that he has witnessed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials fudge alien apprehension statistics by low-balling the number of  got aways    illegal border-crossers who enter the country but avoid being apprehended by border agents.Judd began by denying what he says is the Obama administration s claim that  the border is more secure today than it s ever been. As a Border Patrol Agent, I will tell you the exact opposite,  Judd said.The Obama administration fails  to give the American public key indicators such as the number of arrests of persons from countries with known terrorist ties or from countries that compete economically with our interests,  he added.To support his claim, Judd pointed to statistics showing that in all of fiscal year 2015, Border Patrol arrested five people from Afghanistan, 57 from Pakistan and 1,327 from China.But that number has surged this year, according to Judd. Already in the first five months of this fiscal year, the United States Border Patrol has arrested 18 from Afghanistan 79 from Pakistan and 619 from the Peoples Republic of China,  the union chief said. Those numbers should alarm everyone and we are seeing a similar trend from other key countries like Albania, Bangladesh and Brazil,  he continued.Judd also pointed to what he said is evidence that drug cartels  are winning. He said that during a visit to a station in the Del Rio Border Patrol sector in south Texas, resource-strapped agents were only able to arrest 47 percent of known border-crossers.He said that out of 157 known entries that week, 74 were arrested, 54 evaded arrest and entered the U.S., 17 evaded arrest and returned to Mexico, and 12 were still unaccounted for. That s a 47 percent arrest rate,  said Judd.  That s not very good. He also highlighted the gaps in border security by citing an email he received on Tuesday from a Border Patrol agent in Arizona pointing to a 10-mile stretch of the border that was unmanned for two days. Criminal cartels were able to go to the fence, cut a hole in the fence, drive two vehicles through that hole and escape. They were able then to put the fence back up and try to hide the cuts that were made,  Judd said. The scariest part of those vehicles entering the United States is we don t know what was in those vehicles,  he explained. And of the border-crossers who have not been apprehended, Judd said  we don t know where they were from. Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis 89% , who chairs the national security subcommittee, also asked Judd whether CBP  might be fudging  its apprehension data. Not only have I heard similar reports, I ve actually seen it,  Judd said, recalling a previous stint as an intelligence officer working at a station on the southern border.He said he received a note from a high-ranking watch commander ordering him to remove numbers from a  got-away  report.Via: Daily Caller ",politics,"Mar 24, 2016",0,4155
BOOM! KELLYANNE CONWAY Schools CNN’s Anderson Cooper On The Comey Firing [Video],"Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties.

 Billy Joel Just Publicly Humiliated The Donald–Oblivious Idiot Trump THANKS HIM For It (TWEETS),"Billy Joel made a fool of Donald Trump this weekend with a shoutout tribute to the orange man in front of a capacity crowd at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Trump made a fool of himself shortly thereafter by showing he has no clue what sarcasm is and thanking Joel for the kind gesture:Thank you @BillyJoel  many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG. Appreciate it- love your music!  Donald J.

The iconic song includes the lyrics:I am the entertainer And I know just where I stand Another serenader And another long-haired band Today I am your champion I may have won your hearts But I know the game, you ll forget my name And I won t be here in another year If I don t stay on the chartsI am the entertainer And I ve had to pay my price The things I did not know at first I learned by doin  twice Ah, but still they come to haunt me Still they want their say So I ve learned to dance with a hand in my pants I let  em rub my neck and I write  em a check And they go their merry wayI am the entertainer Been all around the world I ve played all kinds of palaces And laid all kinds of girls I can t remember faces I don t remember names Ah, but what the hell You know it s just as well  Cause after a while and a thousand miles It all becomes the sameIt s a song about the trials and tribulations of being in the business of entertaining people, you twit. Billy Joel just thanked you for keeping him entertained, not for inspiring him or making him believe you were good for anything else. The song is a testament to the futility of your existence because unlike Billy Joel, you have zero talent and nothing worthwhile to offer anyone.This wasn t the first time Joel has made the joke, either. Remember when Trump thought it was hilarious that  New York State Of Mind  was dedicated to Ted Cruz? He failed to recognize that Billy had also dedicated a song to him in Denver. Which song?

 WATCH: Conservative Activist Openly Declares That Contraception Should Be Illegal,"MSNBC host Joy Reid was SHOCKED when a conservative anti-choice activist openly stated that birth control should be banned.During a panel discussion on Saturday, Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life literally admitted that she wants a law that forces women to get pregnant if they want to have sex.The discussion began with Reid pointing out that contraception and mammogram costs will go up for women if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.Reid asked the panel if they agreed that contraception should be legal, and Hawkins not only disagreed, she spewed misinformation about two popular forms of contraception. I believe certain forms can be legal, yes,  Hawkins said.  I don t believe abortion causing contraception should be legal. When asked to specifically name a form of contraception she thinks should be outlawed, Hawkins mentioned  hormonal contraception  like IUDs.REID:  You think IUDs should be illegal? HAWKINS:  I don t think they should be legal. They put women at risk and they kill children. Except that IUDs are one of the safest forms of birth control, and they work by preventing sperm from joining with the egg.According to the Baby Center,Both types of IUDs work primarily by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The copper IUD releases copper into the uterus, which works as a spermicide. The others release a form of the hormone progestin into the uterus. The progestin thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm can t reach the egg.In other words, unless conservatives now believe that life begins BEFORE conception, they should have absolutely no problem with IUDs.But Hawkins also declared that birth control pills should be illegal as well.However, birth control pills also prevent conception by stopping sperm from reaching an egg.According to Columbia University,Birth control pills prevent pregnancy through several mechanisms, mainly by stopping ovulation. If no egg is released, there is nothing to be fertilized by sperm, and the woman cannot get pregnant.So once again, Hawkins is wrong. But she repeated her claims again after Reid asked her to clarify her remarks, and Hawkins confirmed once and for all that anti-choice conservatives want to ban birth control as well as abortion. In my ideal world, yes. But I don t think that s something we re working towards in the pro-life movement. In the pro-life movement we re working towards abolishing abortion. That s why we want Planned Parenthood s money to go to health centers which don t do contraception. By taking money away from Planned Parenthood, millions of women would have less access to birth control that would prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. We ve gotten some real clarity,  Reid commented at the end of the segment.  I think the American people have gotten quite a bit of clarity on what your movement wants to do. Here s the video via VidMe.And if conservatives like Hawkins get their way, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress will strip women of their reproductive rights. And women won t be marching in Washington in defense of their rights next time. They ll declare war on Washington.Featured image via screen capture ",News,"January 28, 2017",0,3226
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING CONSERVATIVES WANT TO HEAR THIS GUY SAY TODAY…," I m leaving the GOP and running as a Democrat!Unfortunately, it doesn t look like that s what we re going to hear from our amnesty loving RINO (Republican In Name Only) friend.Reporting from Washington Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina defense hawk, plans to enter the crowded Republican presidential primary field Monday with a campaign that probably won t deliver him to the White House, but will highlight the party s divide over national security.Graham lacks the big-money backing and name recognition that s likely to be needed to pull away from the party s increasingly unwieldy field.But for him, that may not matter.For the last several years, Graham, a former Air Force colonel and legal officer, has played a central role in a sometimes-bitter battle between the GOP s traditional defense advocates and newly emergent isolationist-leaning libertarians led by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also seeking the party s presidential nomination. The South Carolina senator did not originate the  wacko birds  label for Paul and his allies   that was coined by Graham s best friend in Congress, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)   but he might as well have.Last week Graham was caught on camera rolling his eyes as Paul objected to Senate efforts to continue the National Security Agency s once-secret collection of records of Americans  telephone calls.Paul returned the favor by releasing a video denouncing the NSA program. It ridiculed both Graham and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for their support of NSA surveillance, depicting Graham as trying to read Americans  emails while sitting in a 1997-era car.In an interview during the heat of the Senate debate, Paul also accused Graham, McCain and other Republicans who support arming insurgents in Syria of having contributed to the rise of Islamic State, also referred to as ISIS. ISIS exists and grew stronger because of the hawks in our party, who gave arms indiscriminately, and most of those arms were snatched up by ISIS,  he said.Graham said in an email to supporters that his  presidential announcement will be one of the biggest and most memorable moments of my life. As he approaches the military s mandatory retirement age and eyes the White House, Graham said last week he was retiring from the Air Force after nearly 30 years. He had continued to serve as a reserve officer, at times using his skills as a military lawyer to handle legal affairs in Iraq during breaks from the Senate.A Southern Baptist and conservative on social issues, Graham, who never married, is known as a deal-maker in Congress. In 2013, he led efforts with Democrats to reform immigration laws to allow a path to citizenship for those living illegally in the U.S.Graham, 59, was born in Seneca, S.C., and lived with his family behind their liquor store, restaurant and pool hall on Main Street in Central, S.C., where he plans to announce his campaign.His personal story has helped shape his policymaking. After his parents  death, he helped raise his younger sister and has championed the Social Security survivors  benefits they relied upon as young people.But it is his military service and alliance with McCain that have come to define much of Graham s work in Washington as the two tried to defend hawkish foreign and defense policies against attack from some in the party s new generation. Now, he ll try to bolster those policies on the presidential campaign trail.Via: Virginia Gazette",politics,"Jun 1, 2015",0,3506
Paul Ryan's challenges will not start until after Nov. 8 election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to cruise to re-election in his Wisconsin congressional district on Nov. 8, the day before his real political problems are likely to start. That is when Ryan will know the shape of the new House of Representatives. If, as some analysts foresee, it becomes even more conservative than it is now, Ryan’s difficulties in managing the lower chamber of Congress could worsen. For the highest-ranking elected U.S. Republican, that could spell trouble as the former vice presidential nominee looks ahead to a possible presidential run in 2020. Some staunch House conservatives, questioning Ryan’s commitment to them and their agenda, are looking less kindly on the idea of re-electing him as speaker early next year. But his real test, assuming he retains the speaker’s gavel, would be getting legislative results with a more conservative House. Compounding that could be the U.S. Senate switching to Democratic from Republican control and possibly a Democratic president, Hillary Clinton, if she beats Republican Donald Trump in the November election. “Next year, almost no matter what, is going to be a very tough one for Paul Ryan,” said political scientist Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute think tank. The 2016 election results could cast a shadow over Ryan’s presidential ambitions in 2020 and 2024, assuming he harbors them. “It may well be that he decides it’s just not worth it, partly given what he sees within his own party,” Ornstein said. Ryan’s aides were reluctant on Monday to discuss the possible challenges of the next Congress. “The focus over the next 57 days is defending and strengthening our House majority. We are in a good position,”  said Ryan’s political spokesman, Zack Roday. Republicans hold 246 of the 435 House seats, their biggest majority in decades. But analysts expect the party will lose seats in November, especially if Trump hurts fellow Republicans. House members serve two-year terms and most are easily re-elected. The political prediction newsletter “Sabato’s Crystal Ball” has tagged only 16 races as too close to call. Ten of those are currently held by moderates or pragmatists who have been fairly reliable supporters of legislation backed by Republican leaders including Ryan. Five of the 10 are retiring from the House. If Trump’s performance damages candidates down the ticket, moderates may bear the brunt. The result could be a smaller House Republican majority more dominated by politically secure conservatives of the sort who have in recent years defied Ryan on some legislation. “A shrinking GOP conference is no doubt going to be more conservative in the new Congress, raising the challenge for Speaker Ryan to form majorities with a slimmer and more conservative rank and file,” said Sarah Binder, professor of political science at George Washington University. If a number of moderates lose their seats, while most conservatives hold theirs, “then the House Freedom Caucus becomes more powerful,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of “Sabato’s Crystal Ball.” The Freedom Caucus is the House’s most conservative bloc, with about 40 members. It helped eject Ryan’s predecessor, John Boehner, a year ago, leading to Ryan’s election as speaker. The Freedom Caucus initially welcomed Ryan, a budget and fiscal policy specialist seen as more willing to listen to their agenda. But some Freedom Caucus members are unhappy with him since one of their members, Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, lost a primary election last month. Ryan could have done more to help Huelskamp, some critics said. “There was huge disappointment in that,” said Representative John Fleming, a Freedom Caucus member from Louisiana who is running for the U.S. Senate in November. The Huelskamp fallout has driven speculation that some conservatives who previously backed Ryan will oppose him when the House elects a new speaker in January, although none of them has said so publicly. “I don’t think most members feel yet that Ryan is undeserving of more time (as speaker), but frustration with the leadership is certainly growing,” said Dan Holler of Heritage Action, the political wing of the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank.

Saudi-led coalition wants Yemen weapons checks strengthened before main port reopens,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen said it will continue to block the main aid route into the country until it is satisfied its Houthi opponents cannot use it to bring in weapons. The coalition closed all air, land and sea access to Yemen last week following the interception of a missile fired toward the Saudi capital, saying it had to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. Aid agencies warned the move would worsen the humanitarian crisis in the country, where the war has left an estimated seven million people facing famine. Ports controlled by Yemen s exiled government would reopen soon, the coalition said on Sunday in a statement issued by the Saudi mission at the United Nations. However other ports, including Houthi-controlled Hodeidah   where some 80 percent of Yemen s food supplies enter   will remain closed until a U.N. verification regime is reviewed to ensure no weapons reach the Houthis, the statement said.  The coalition, in consultation and full agreement with the legitimate government, will begin steps related to re-opening of airports and ports in Yemen to allow the transport of humanitarian and commercial cargo,  the statement said. It said the first steps will start within 24 hours and will include the southern ports of Aden and Mukalla and the Red Sea port of al-Mokha, which are all controlled by Hadi s government. The coalition asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to send a delegation to Riyadh to  review current inspection measures to reinforce and introduce a more effective inspection and verification regime (UNVIM) aimed at facilitating the flow of humanitarian and commercial supplies and prevent smuggling of weapons, ammunition and missile parts...  Saudi Arabia has accused arch-foe Iran of supplying the ballistic missile which was shot down near Riyadh airport without causing any casualties. Iran has denied the accusation.  The United Nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition in the past for blocking aid access, especially to the north, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthis battling the Saudi-led coalition. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which pits the internationally recognized government, backed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, against the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

 WATCH Bill O’Reilly Go Off The Rails And Blame Obama For Literally EVERYTHING,"Okay, nobody can accuse Bill O Reilly of being a supporter of Obama, but his show tonight was off the charts. He decided it would be a good idea to remind his audience just how President Obama has made the world a really terrible place. To that end, he proceeded to use his show to blame Obama for absolutely everything wrong with the world right now.So just what is Obama responsible for? Let us count them alongside Media Matters for America:O Reilly says there s more, but his show is only so long so he probably thinks he can t list them. But he made some wild leaps of logic, like the following on terrorism and Brexit: Mr. Obama s failure to destroy Assad s air force in Syria, when he could have, after drawing that red line over poison gas, has directly led to millions of refugees storming into Europe. That crisis has profoundly damaged the region and perhaps even stimulated Great Britain leaving the European Union. Really? He s looking at a series of events and putting them together in what he must think is a totally logical way, without even trying to understand some of the underlying factors, like immigrants from Eastern Europe as well as a sense that Britain had lost its sovereignty. It s really a wonder that Billo the Clown thinks his show is all about telling the truth.The whole,  race relations are worse now under Obama,  thing is misleading, and reeks of  Oh, well, Obama s black and liberal and his political correctness is responsible for deteriorating race relations.  No, O Reilly and his ilk need to pull their collective heads out of their collective asses before speaking of things they know nothing about. Race relations were last this bad in 1992, after Rodney King, not the  60s, and while this has happened under Obama, he is not the cause of it.Frivolous lawsuits? O Reilly used the word  charlatans  when discussing that, so he s very likely talking about people suing governments for promoting Christianity, which is illegal under the First Amendment. Those aren t frivolous, but O Reilly and his white, Christian privilege are mired in a delusion from which there is no escape.If he s talking about regular frivolous lawsuits, then he s way off. Those have been around forever now.There s too much to really address all of it, but suffice it to say that O Reilly s pursuing a bit of a witch hunt against Obama while talking up Donald Trump. He should stick to what he s good at oh wait. That s nothing. Watch him lose his grip on reality below:Featured image by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for The Rumble 2012",News,"July 25, 2016",0,2630

Comoros lawmaker leading citizenship inquiry attacked,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Unknown attackers torched a car belonging to deputy head of the parliament of Comoros late on Sunday, the latest in a series of threats apparently aimed at derailing an investigation he is leading, the lawmaker said. Dhoulkamal Dhoihir, vice president of the National Assembly, is leading an inquiry into a plan to sell Comoros citizenship to stateless people in Gulf states. The scheme would earn Comoros, an island state off Africa s eastern coast, $200 million to $300 million, but it has been dogged by allegations of corruption. The incident comes a day before the commission Dhoihir heads is due to question two former presidents - Ikililou Dhoinine, who left office last year, and Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi, who launched the citizenship scheme in late 2008.  As I was finishing up my dinner I heard a loud noise and the car alarm go off. I opened the door and saw my car on fire. Everything was destroyed,  Dhoihir told Reuters on Monday.  It was definitely linked to my work. There are lots of people who don t want this information to come out,  he added. Abdoul-Kader Mahmoud, the director of the police, said the investigation was continuing, but officers had not yet identified the cause of the incident.  It could have been a technical problem, but we are not ruling out any explanation,  he told Reuters. Dhoirir said that he had faced threats via social media and a group of MPs have tried to shut down his commission of inquiry, which began work in the summer and is due to submit its report next month. Dhoirir said that the commission had requested extra security after coming under increased pressure as the investigation advanced. None was provided until Sunday night, after the fire, he said. Mahmoud denied commissioners had requested extra security before the incident but said officers had been dispatched to the residences of members of the commission.  We have taken the measures. We have sent more men to protect these people,  he said. Under President Azali Assoumani, the Comoros government has suspended the issuing of new citizenships until the commission completes its work.  This is a very serious incident. Those who risk being exposed are sending a very clear message,  a former top government official said. ",worldnews,"November 6, 2017 ",1,2320
 Conservatives Will HATE What Donald Trump Just Said About Planned Parenthood (VIDEO),"Donald Trump isn t exactly a stranger to making large groups of people angry   women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, and mainstream Republicans all despise The Donald. One group, however, has always strongly supported him   the Stupid Part of America   and he s about to lose them, too. Trump s popularity with conservatives has soared since he began screaming about a god he will never actually understand, baby parts, and other favorite talking points of theirs   but his recent remarks about Planned Parenthood may lose him a lot of support among the segment of the population who are dumb enough to fall for heavily-edited propaganda videos.At the insanely heated GOP debate, Ted Cruz managed to trick The Donald into defending Planned Parenthood. During one of the screaming matches between Trump and Cruz that have become rather commonplace, the Texas Senator accused the billionaire of supporting federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Eventually, he managed to goad Trump into supporting Planned Parenthood, though The Donald still spoke out against abortion. But let me say more blunt Donald you notice didn t agree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood and Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record he screams  Liar! Liar! Liar! ,  Cruz said, pointing out that Trump has, in the past, said Planned Parenthood does  wonderful things.  Trump replied: It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion. There are wonderful things having to do with women s health, but not when it comes to abortion. Planned Parenthood absolutely does do wonderful things. But unlike Trump s assertion, those wonderful things include giving women access to a safe, sanitary abortion if they choose to have one. Planned Parenthood also provides numerous irreplaceable services to women that have nothing at all to do with abortion, as well as informs women of alternatives to terminating a pregnancy   like adoption. In fact, only three percent of the organization s services are abortion-related.Unfortunately for Trump, this moment of honesty about Planned Parenthood will haunt him right up until election day   because conservatives simply don t care about women.Watch the exchange below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 14, 2016",0,2375

"Schwarzenegger fired, didn't quit 'Apprentice': Trump","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump disputed Arnold Schwarzenegger’s announcement about quitting as host of the reality show “The Celebrity Apprentice,” saying on Saturday that Schwarzenegger was leaving involuntarily after drawing few viewers. Schwarzenegger had announced on Friday that he would not return for a second season of the NBC show. He blamed Trump, an executive producer and former host of the show, for low ratings, describing the president’s involvement as “baggage.” Trump sees it differently. “Arnold Schwarzenegger isn’t voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me,” Trump wrote in a message on his personal Twitter account. “Sad end to great show.” The squabble then continued on Twitter. “You should think about hiring a new joke writer and a fact checker,” a message on Schwarzenegger’s Twitter account read, responding to Trump.  NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp on Friday, did not comment on Schwarzenegger’s decision not to return for another season, or on the show’s future.  Schwarzenegger, a movie star and former California governor, took over as host of “Celebrity Apprentice” last year. His first season premiered in January, and was watched by around 4 million to 5 million viewers. Trump faced criticism over potential conflicts of interests after winning the presidency last November when he said he would retain an executive producer credit on the show.  On at least one occasion, he has used part of a public appearance as president to scornfully discuss Schwarzenegger’s ratings. Trump was a celebrity businessman long before he became president, and hosted “The Apprentice” and “The Celebrity Apprentice” for 14 seasons, overseeing contestants competing in business challenges before deciding which ones to fire.

Kellyanne Conway 'inadvertently' plugged Ivanka products: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House told a government watchdog agency that Kellyanne Conway, a senior aide to President Donald Trump, acted “inadvertently” when she publicly endorsed the clothing and jewelry line of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, according to a letter the administration released on Wednesday. Conway came under criticism last month when she said on television that Americans should “go buy Ivanka’s stuff,” in comments that appeared to violate government ethics rules prohibiting the use of public office to endorse products or advance personal business gains. In a letter to a government ethics watchdog agency, White House Deputy Counsel Stefan Passantino said he met with Conway after her comments and that she committed to follow the rules in the future. The Office of Government Ethics has said the White House should consider taking disciplinary action against Conway. But there was no mention in Passantino’s letter of any disciplinary action. “We concluded that Ms. Conway acted inadvertently and is highly unlikely to do so again,” Passantino said in the letter to Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub.  “It is noted that Ms. Conway made the statement in question in a light, off-hand manner while attempting to stand up for a person she believed had been unfairly treated and did so without nefarious motive or intent to benefit personally,” the letter said.  Conway spoke about Ivanka Trump’s products after department store chain Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) said it was dropping the brand of the president’s older daughter. A day before her appearance on television, Trump complained on Twitter that Nordstrom had treated his daughter unfairly by dropping her line. Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ oversight panel, criticized the White House response, saying other federal employees would likely be suspended if they made similar comments endorsing products or services. Norman Eisen, a former ethics adviser to President Barack Obama, said each federal agency decides for itself how to handle such violations. He said he would have preferred a tougher response from Trump’s White House, but he said Passantino’s handling of the situation appeared reasonable. ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2017 ",1,2314
WEDDING CRASHERS: Hillary Tries To Explain Why She And Bill Attended Trump Wedding And Proves They Are First Class Grifters,"Who goes to a wedding and doesn t bring a gift?

Hillary admits she and Bill thought the wedding would be  fun .Grifters Opportunists The Clinton s That s who When Hillary Clinton and husband Bill attended Donald Trump s 2005 wedding, their presence was their present.Asked at a Monday night forum in Iowa what she got Trump for his wedding, Clinton responded with a slight smile,  Nothing. Nothing. He used to   he was basically a Democrat before he was a Republican,  she continued,  and he was, you know, somebody that we all knew in New York. And he was supportive of Democrats. He was supportive of a lot of the causes that I cared about and that people I knew cared about. Now he seems to have taken another road,  she concluded.At the GOP debate in Cleveland, Trump claimed Clinton had  no choice  but to attend his wedding. Trump married Melania Knauss, his third wife, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.In August, Clinton offered a different explanation for attending. I didn t know him that well. I mean I knew him, and I happened to be in Florida, and I thought it was going to be fun to go to this wedding, because it s always entertaining,  she said last year. It s all entertainment. I think he s having the time of his life, saying what he wants to say getting people excited both for and against him. It is generally accepted that guests invited to a wedding bring a gift, even when the groom is a real estate mogul.Advice columnist Miss Manners wrote in 2013,  You should not be attending a wedding if you do not care about the couple (either truly, or because they are relatives and you are supposed to care), and therefore wedding guests give wedding presents.

Zimbabwe's Mnangagwa drops education minister after public outcry,"(Reuters) - Zimbabwe s new president Emmerson Mnangagwa dropped his education minister, a day after reappointing him to a cabinet which gave top posts to senior military officials in what was widely seen as a reward for the army s role in the removal of his predecessor, Robert Mugabe. Mnangagwa made other changes to the cabinet that his chief secretary  Misheck Sibanda called  adjustments to ensure compliance with the Constitution and considerations of gender, demography and special needs .  Under the Zimbabwean constitution, ministers and their deputies have to be members of parliament, except five who can be chosen for their professional skills and competence. Mnangagwa had named as ministers seven people, including Major-General Sibusiso Moyo as foreign minister and Marshall Perrance Shiri to the sensitive land portfolio, who are not lawmakers.  He replaced primary and higher education minister Lazaraus Dokora with his deputy Paul Mavima. Dokora s reappointment had caused an outcry from Zimbabweans on social media and radio shows who slammed him for poor performance and undermining the country s education system. He also named ZANU-PF lawmaker Petronella Kagonye to the labor and social welfare portfolio, replacing university professor Clever Nyathi who was appointed special advisor in the president s office on national peace and reconciliation.  Chris Mutsvanga, leader of the powerful war veterans  association and who was named media, information and broadcast minister, has also been appointed special advisor to the president. Sworn in as president last Friday after 93-year-old Mugabe quit in the wake of a de facto military coup, Mnangagwa s cabinet drew criticisms from analysts and Zimbabweans who had expected a more broad-based lineup that marked a break from the Mugabe era.

Hamas chief in Gaza says Palestinian unity deal is collapsing,"GAZA (Reuters) - Palestinian Islamist group Hamas s leader in Gaza said on Thursday a reconciliation deal with President Mahmoud Abbas s Fatah faction was collapsing, just 10 weeks after the agreement was reached. The rivals signed a deal brokered by Cairo on Oct. 12 after Hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of the Gaza Strip, including its border crossings with Egypt and Israel, a decade after seizing control of the enclave in a civil war. The deal bridged a deep gulf between Abbas s Western-backed mainstream Fatah and Hamas, an Islamist movement designated a terrorist group by Western countries and Israel. But continued disputes have delayed its implementation.  Yehya Al-Sinwar, Hamas s chief in Gaza and a key architect of the unity agreement, offered a bleak outlook on Thursday, suggesting the deal could suffer a similar fate to numerous reconciliation attempts over the past decade.  The reconciliation project is falling apart. Only a blind man can t see that,  Sinwar said in comments published by pro-Hamas media. One of the latest disputes came earlier this month when Hamas, according to Fatah officials, missed a milestone to complete the handover of Gaza to Abbas s West Bank-based government. Hamas says it has given up all administrative control in Gaza. Rami Al-Hamdallah, the prime minister, said Hamas had not transferred moneys as agreed, while Hamas said Hamdallah s government had not paid salaries in Gaza as agreed. Sinwar in the past has said his group would not go back to governing Gaza and that he was committed to making the deal succeed. Fatah officials declined immediate comment.  Reconciliation is collapsing because some people want to get from it the relinquishing of arms and the closing of tunnels,  said Sinwar without elaborating, but in apparent reference to Fatah. During the last Gaza war, in 2014, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel s superior forces and threaten civilian communities near the frontier. Israel and the United States have called for Hamas to be disarmed as part of the pact between it and the Palestinian Authority, so that Israeli peace efforts with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which collapsed in 2014, can proceed. Hamas has rejected the demand. ",worldnews,"December 21, 2017 ",1,2322

Experts dispute Trump's assertion that U.S. nuclear arms capability is lagging,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While President Donald Trump has suggested that the United States must expand its nuclear arsenal, many experts say U.S. nuclear forces are unrivaled and will remain so as they undergo a modernization program that could cost more than $1 trillion. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trump said the United States has “fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.” He pledged to ensure that, “We’re going to be at the top of the pack.”  While Moscow currently deploys 200 more strategic nuclear warheads than the United States does, both countries are bound by the 2010 New START treaty to slash their deployed strategic warheads to no more than 1,550 each by February 2018, the lowest level in decades. The accord also limits their deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.         However, nuclear weapons experts say, the 30-year modernization program, which maintains many existing weapons and their computers, communications, electronics, and other systems, is more important than having as many warheads as Russia has. Trump “says we can’t fall behind. Fall behind who and how?” said Stephen Schwartz, an independent nuclear weapons expert.  “It is not clear to me, and it’s not clear to many of my colleagues” what the president is talking about when he pledges to expand U.S. nuclear weapons capacity, Schwartz said. Moreover, the U.S. advantage is based not on the numbers of warheads it can field compared to Russia, but on more advanced delivery systems.     Most of Moscow’s nuclear force - now being modernized, as well - is comprised of land-based ICBMs whose locations it discloses to Washington under arms control accords, said Schwartz, former publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists leading journal. The United States maintains an “invulnerable” fleet of nuclear-armed submarines beneath the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that are immune from detection, he said. In contrast, Russia’s accident-prone missile submarines rarely conduct their “deterrence patrols” far from their docks.    In a fiscal 2012 report to Congress, the Pentagon assessed that even if Russia broke out of the limits imposed by the New START treaty and deployed more nuclear weapons, it could not gain strategic advantage over the United States. “The Russian Federation, therefore, would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty,” the report said.   Trump “clearly needs to get a briefing on the capacity of U.S. nuclear forces,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, a leading arms control organization. The 30-year U.S. modernization program is intended to maintain the American advantage. It upgrades and extends the lives of every U.S. nuclear weapons system – intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range bombers and submarines – and their warheads. In addition, the Pentagon has drawn up plans to replace many systems with a new bomber, new ballistic missile submarine, and new missiles. Many lawmakers and experts are concerned about the price tag of the effort, given the high cost of repairing and modernizing the country’s conventional military forces and the budgetary demands of non-military programs. The costs of the modernization program  has been estimated at as much as $1 trillion over the next 30 years. But a report published this month by the Congressional Budget Office indicated that the overall cost is rising. Nuclear force plans set out by the Pentagon and the Energy Department – the caretaker of the U.S. nuclear arsenal – in their fiscal 2017 budget requests would cost an estimated $400 billion during only the 10-year period ending in fiscal 2026.

Ex president of Vatican hospital convicted of abuse of office,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The former president of a Vatican-owned hospital in Rome on Saturday was convicted of abuse of office for diverting nearly half a million dollars of funds to renovate a top cardinal s luxury apartment. The Vatican court, a three-judge panel, gave Giuseppe Profiti a one-year suspended sentence. The prosecution had asked for three years for the former head of the prestigious Bambino Gesu hospital. It also reduced the seriousness of the charge against Profiti to abuse of office from the initial embezzlement. Massimo Spina, the hospital s treasurer, was acquitted. Testimony at the trial, which began in July in the city-state s courtroom, again exposed lack of transparency in the financial handling of Vatican assets in Italy, where it owns numerous institutions and much real estate. Profiti and Spina were charged with spending 422,000 euros ($481,000) in 2013 and 2014 on refurbishing the large Vatican retirement home of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Holy See s former number two. His retirement apartment, which has a huge terrace and breath-taking view of the dome of St. Peter s Basilica, has become a symbol of the difficulty of the frugal-minded pope s efforts to rein in the luxury some Church leaders still enjoy. Bertone, 82, was the Vatican secretary of state, effectively the deputy pope, for most of the pontificate of former Pope Benedict and was one of the most powerful men in the Roman Catholic Church. He was removed from office in 2013, eight months after the election of Francis. The renovation started a few weeks later on the spacious property, which is next door to the Vatican guest house where the pope lives in a modest suite. Bertone hired the construction firm of a friend to do the reconstruction work, bypassing the customary bidding process, and made a down payment with his own money. The company eventually went bankrupt but the foundation that runs the hospital sent 422,000 euros to a London-based company affiliated with the construction firm. Neither Bertone nor the owner of the construction company were called to testify at the trial. When the Vatican confirmed last year that Profiti and Spina were under investigation, a lawyer for Bertone said the cardinal had never asked for or authorized payment for the restoration work from hospital funds. Profiti said the hospital used some of its funds to renovate Bertone s apartment because the cardinal had agreed that it could be used for fundraising. After the scandal was first revealed in a book, Bertone gave 150,000 euros of his own money to the Bambino Gesu to make amends for damage done to the hospital s image.

Hamida, her husband Nasir Ahmed and their two young sons were among 18 refugees on a small fishing boat crossing the Bay of Bengal to the Bangladesh village of Shah Porir Dwip.  As they neared the shore, the boat capsized and they were tossed into the murky water. Reuters photographer Mohammad Ponir Hossain was taking pictures of exhausted refugees on the beach when he heard an autorickshaw driver shouting that a boat had capsized.

The couple s other son survived the accident. Around 400,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in less than three weeks and people are still arriving, by land and sea, after attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a fierce counteroffensive by Myanmar s army.

 Aziz Ansari Just Told Trump To ‘Go F*ck Himself’ As Only He Can (TWEET),"In the aftermath of the Orlando shooting, there has been yet another unfounded uprising of hate and fear against the Muslim community. Donald Trump is even calling, once more, for a ban on all Muslim immigrants.With a lot to say on this matter is none other than comedian Aziz Ansari, whose parents just so happen to be Muslim immigrants. He wrote a piece for the New York Times, and called out Trump s hatred where it stands.In the intro to his article on Twitter, Ansari just flat-out told Trump to  go f*ck himself. Trump wants to ban Muslim immigrants like my parents. I wrote a piece for New York Times telling him to go fuck himself. Trump wants to ban Muslim immigrants like my parents. I wrote a piece for @NYTimes telling him to go fuck himself: https://t.co/MCDsQyz2jy  Aziz Ansari (@azizansari) June 24, 2016Within the article, which you can find in full here, Ansari wrote: Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. It s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense. He explains that he s the son of Muslim immigrants, and how his family is now told to be careful in how they worship. Also explaining, that as American citizens, that is absolutely awful. We have the freedom of religion in this nation, and everyone has a right to worship how they so choose on their own time.Ansari wrote that despite not being religious himself, even looking like you might be Muslim can make you a target of discrimination: There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else. He added: The vitriolic and hate-filled rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump isn t so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window. He has said that people in the American Muslim community  know who the bad ones are,  implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks. Not only is this wrongheaded; but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks. By Mr. Trump s logic, after the huge financial crisis of 2007-08, the best way to protect the American economy would have been to man white males. Is Ansari right in telling Trump to  go f*ck himself ?? Absolutely. Trump is personally attacking Ansari and his family and is just so absolutely wrong about the Muslim faith and community.Trump s tactic of divide and conquer, putting himself and his white pride fanatics against anyone who doesn t fit the mold of what he sees fit to live in the United States, isn t only bigoted, but just outright dangerous.Good on Ansari for speaking out and calling Trump out on his bigotry.Featured Photos by John Moore/Getty Images and Gary Gershoff/Getty Images for Peabody ",News,"June 24, 2016",0,2903
WOW! JEB BUSH Claims Roy Moore Should “Step Aside” On Same Day SIXTH Woman Accuses George HW Bush Of Sexual Assault: Groped Her When She “Was A Child”,"Monday on CNBC, former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL) said due to the sexual misconduct accusations leveled against former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, he should step aside in his campaign for the U.S. Senate.Bush said,  This is not a question of innocence or guilt like in a criminal proceeding, this is a question of what s right and what s wrong.

"Democrats to join Trump, Republicans in talks to avert government shutdown","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic leaders in Congress on Monday accepted an invitation to meet U.S. President Donald Trump and Republicans for talks to avert a government shutdown this week, even as the Democrats pressed demands on funding priorities and protecting young immigrants.   House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who canceled a meeting with Trump last week after he posted a disparaging note about them on Twitter, said on Monday they hoped the president would remain open-minded about reaching a deal with Democrats. “We need to reach a budget agreement that equally boosts funds for our military and key priorities here at home,” Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement. “There is a bipartisan path forward on all of these items.” The meeting was scheduled for Thursday, a day before funding for the federal government is due to run out. House Republicans over the weekend introduced a stopgap measure that would fund the government at current levels until Dec. 22 to give lawmakers time to reach a deal on a longer-term bill. Congress is expected to vote on the measure this week. Conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus asked House Republican leaders to extend the duration of the stopgap measure through Dec. 30 in exchange for their votes for the House to go to conference with the Senate on tax legislation, which moved Congress closer to a final bill for a major tax overhaul.  “There is a better chance of going to the 30th than the 22nd, but no commitment,” Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters. The House Republican leadership agreed to consider the Dec. 30 date and talk to the Senate leadership about it, a House Republican leadership aide said. Trump is scheduled to have lunch with Republican members of the Senate at the White House on Tuesday. Republicans have a majority in both the House and Senate. But they will need some Democratic support to get the spending bill past Senate procedural hurdles that require 60 votes, since there are only 52 Republicans in the 100-member chamber.  Schumer said on Monday that everyone should be working to avoid a shutdown, and he did not believe Republican congressional leaders wanted one.  “The only one at the moment who’s flirted with a shutdown is President Trump, who tweeted earlier this year that ‘we could use a good shutdown to fix the mess,’” Schumer said. The Republican bill will provide some short-term help for states that are running out of money to finance a health insurance program for lower-income children, Republican aides said. Schumer and Pelosi on Monday listed that program among their priorities, which also included the opioid crisis, pension plans, rural infrastructure and protection for young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, known as “Dreamers.” Those young immigrants must be taken care of now,  Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin declared on the Senate floor. He said Democrats had offered in return to toughen border security, a Republican priority. “How can we in good conscience pass a spending bill giving authority and resources to this administration to go out and arrest and deport these young people - and not address the underlying issue of their legality and future in the United States?” Durbin asked.

France gets serious over sexual harassment after Weinstein scandal: minister,"PARIS (Reuters) - The Harvey Weinstein scandal is forcing a rethink of attitudes toward sexual harassment in France, a country that cherishes its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, said the minister tasked with cracking down on violence against women. Movie producer Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they were raped. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. More than 300,000 accounts of sexual harassment or abuse have been published under the French #balancetonporc or #squealonyourpig hashtag on Twitter in the past week, though some conservatives say the new trend amounts to an attack on the French way of life in the name of U.S.-style puritanism.  We are really at a turning point, with the Weinstein affair as a trigger,  Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa told Reuters on Friday in an interview. France has often debated sexual harassment over the past decade following scandals involving French politicians. Six years ago, a sex scandal forced former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund, provoking a round of soul-searching in France about sexual abuse that goes undeclared or undetected in the upper echelons of power. A deputy of Macron s year-old Republic on the Move party (LREM), Christophe Arend, was accused by his ex-assistant and campaign manager of sexual harassment, the Franceinfo media outlet reported on Friday. The party said in a statement that Arend benefitted from a presumption of innocence until proven otherwise and that he had filed a complaint of  slanderous denunciation  against his accuser.  Any form of violence and harassment is intolerable. It is up to the justice (process) and it alone to shed light,  LREM said. Gender Equality Minister Schiappa said the Weinstein scandal could have a more durable impact in France because it had prompted women from all walks of life to denounce harassment and assault at work and in public places, not only in the corridors of power.  When it s about politicians, most people just slam politicians rather than seeing it as a wider issue,  said Schiappa, a 34-year-old blogger-turned-minister in President Emmanuel Macron s new government.  But when it s to do with cinema it has a wider impact, because ... people identify with actors and actresses,  she added, describing the wave of testimonies on social media as a  liberation . This week Schiappa kicked off nationwide consultations over a law due to be completed early next year that will include steps to fight sexual harassment on the streets as well as extend the statute of limitation for rape of minors. Not all French people approve of her plans or of the  #squealonyourpig trend on Twitter.  France is a country of men who love women  wrote pundits Berenice Levet and Guillaume Bigot in Le Figaro daily on Thursday.  It is not a country of Platonic love,  they said, warning against the import of what French conservatives have long denigrated as a killjoy  Anglo-Saxon  view of relationships between men and women. Responding to such criticism, Schioppa said:  There is some reluctance, some say we will kill the culture of the  French lover ... if we punish street harassment.   But it s the opposite. We want to preserve seduction, chivalry and  l amour   la francaise  by saying what is key is consent. Between consenting adults everything is allowed, we can seduce, talk, but if someone says  no , it s  no  and it s final,  she said. Much of the French debate focuses on plans to slap fines on harassment in the street and whether that is really feasible. Schiappa acknowledged it was hard to define, adding details would be decided through wide consultations in coming months.  For instance it s following a woman through several blocks or asking for her phone number 15 straight times,  said Schiappa, adding that she personally did not believe wolf-whistles should be characterized as sexual harassment.

 The Amount Of People Shot This Year So Far By TODDLERS Will Make Your Stomach Turn,"An analysis by the Washington Post has discovered that in the first four months of 2016, there have been 23 people in America that have been shot by toddlers. Our gun obsessed nation has gotten to the point where deadly weapons in the hands of children too young for kindergarten actually has a body count.Last year, a Washington Post analysis found that toddlers were finding guns and shooting people at a rate of about one a week. This year, that pace has accelerated. There have been at least 23 toddler-involved shootings since Jan. 1, compared with 18 over the same period last year.In the vast majority of cases, the children accidentally shoot themselves. That s happened 18 times this year, and in nine of those cases the children died of their wounds.Toddlers have shot other people five times this year.The most recent instance of this problem grabbing national headlines was when a two-year-old Milwaukee child got ahold of a gun carelessly placed on the backseat of a car and shot his mother, 26-year-old Patrice Price, killing her.Despite these horrific incidents, unacceptable in so much of the advanced, modern world but treated in America as if there s nothing to be done, the will to do anything about guns at the federal level is almost nonexistent.Intimidated by the NRA flexing its muscles to oppose pro-gun safety political candidates, Republicans and a few Democrats in Congress have refused to bring up legislation about guns. If any action has occurred, it has been in the states, and largely in states with a large Democratic majority in the northeast   which leaves citizens in the rest of the country unprotected thanks to some strategically placed campaign contributions.Recently the NRA s media arm, NRA News, went after Hillary Clinton because she has argued in favor of legislation that the gun lobby opposes. More of that sort of behavior is to be expected in the general election, but they did the same against President Obama in 2008 and 2012, obviously unsuccessfully.

Supreme Court choice based solely on qualifications: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama tapped appellate court judge Merrick Garland to fill an empty Supreme Court seat based solely on qualifications, the White House said on Wednesday. “The president was looking for the very best person for the job, and regardless of age, the president was focused on choosing somebody who has the proper temperament and the unquestioned legal credentials and a commitment to public service to do this job,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a regular news briefing when asked why Obama did not tap someone younger than the 63-year-old judge to help cement his legacy. “The president chose the person that he believes is the best person for the job,” Earnest said.

GOP MAJORITY SENATE FINALLY GETS IT RIGHT: Votes To Gut Obamacare And Defund Planned Parenthood,"The Democrats tried to attach a gun control amendment to the bill, but Republicans blocked those amendments. Of course, Obama says he ll veto the bill. What the majority of Americans want is of no consequence to the King The U.S. Senate approved a bill Thursday that would strip Obamacare of key tax-raising features and would also eliminate taxpayer-funding of abortion businesses, including Planned Parenthood. For years, the American people have been calling on Washington to build a bridge away from Obamacare,  said Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). For years, Democrats prevented the Senate from passing legislation to do so. The 52 to 47 vote also would strip taxpayer funding from Planned Parenthood for one year. This measures has been pushed by a renewed call to defund the abortion business since the release of videos exposing the organization s apparent practices of harvesting body parts of unborn babies and altering the position of babies during abortions in order to harvest their intact organs.Sens. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)challenged a repeal bill passed by the House for not going far enough. A conservative aide tells Breitbart News that Senate leadership is finally following their lead in keeping their promises to the American people who elected them.The measure, which passed 52-47 under the reconciliation budgetary process, will head to the House for a vote. The House passed a similar Obamacare repeal bill. The Senate and the House must soon approve identical bills before they can get to the president s desk.President Barack Obama, however, has already said he will veto the Senate bill.In the Senate, Democrats and several liberal Republicans tried but failed to gut the language that defunds Planned Parenthood from the bill.Family Research Council president Tony Perkins commended the U.S. Senate for approving the bill.  This is a huge victory for unborn children, their mothers, and for taxpayers,  Perkins said.  For the first time during the Obama presidency, both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have approved legislation that begins to end the forced partnership between taxpayers and Planned Parenthood. President Obama will now bear the moral responsibility for sending our tax dollars to a group that has engaged in the selling of baby body parts,  he continued.  Even if the President vetoes the bill, we ve still succeeded, because a Senate precedent has now been set for moving a similar measure forward when America finally has a President who understands the value of every person, born and unborn. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, also praised the Senate s approval of the legislation that would transfer taxpayer Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood to health care clinics that do not perform abortions.  It s an understatement to say that Planned Parenthood has shown itself unworthy of taxpayer support,  said Pavone.  The 325,000 lives it destroys every year are 325,000 reasons to redirect taxpayer funds to groups that provide health care without taking innocent lives. When there are legitimate health care providers that actually help women and their babies, it s a travesty to give one dime to Planned Parenthood,  he added.  The Senate is to be commended for standing up for women, their children, and taxpayers who object to subsidizing a billion-dollar abortion business. The bill would also end the individual mandate of Obamacare that requires most people to purchase health insurance, and strip the authority of the federal government to run health care exchanges.

Trump said the United States was ready to make a bilateral deal with any country in the Indo-Pacific region, but only on the basis of  mutual respect and mutual benefit . Although he was addressing a meeting alongside the summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders, he repeatedly referred to the Indo-Pacific region and mentioned the importance of India in his speech.

JUST IN: MUELLER’S “Right Hand Man” Represented IT Staffer Who Destroyed Hillary’s Blackberrys With A Hammer!,"You just can t make this stuff up Yet another key member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe appears to have deep ties to the Democratic Party.From PJ Media: Aaron Zebley served previously as Mueller s chief of staff at the FBI and as a senior counselor in the National Security Division at the Department of Justice. He also served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the National Security and Terrorism Unit in Alexandria, Virginia.Also, in 2015 when he was a lawyer, he represented Justin Cooper, the IT staffer who personally set up Hillary Clinton s unsecured server in her Chappaqua home, Fox News  Tucker Carlson revealed on his show Thursday.Cooper, it so happens, is also the aide who destroyed Clinton s old BlackBerries with a hammer.Watch the brilliant television ad Ted Cruz s team made during the election, that mocked Hillary Clinton and Justin Cooper for destroying evidence of her crimes, when they smashed her Blackberrys with a hammer:Documents obtained by Fox News show that Senate investigators grew frustrated with Zebley after being repeatedly stonewalled when they were trying to set up a meeting with Cooper. Mr. Zebley telephoned Homeland Security [Committee] staff to inform them that Cooper had chosen to cancel the interview,  the documents said.In a letter to Cooper, congressional investigators complained:  We are troubled by your attorney s [referring to Zebley] complete refusal to engage the committee in a discussion about how to further assuage your concerns. Let this sink in. The same attorney who played a defensive role for Hillary Clinton was tapped by Mueller in June to play an offensive role against Clinton opponent Trump.But Zebley isn t the only questionable hire. Out of a team of fifteen lawyers, nine of them have donated to Democratic candidates. None of them seem to have Republican leanings.Jeannie Rhee, who was hired by Mueller last summer to work on the probe, was the personal attorney of Ben Rhodes and also represented the Clinton Foundation, Fox News  Laura Ingraham reported on Wednesday.",left-news,"Dec 8, 2017",0,2169

 WATCH: Fox Host Smiles At The Thought Of An October Terrorist Attack That Would Help Trump,"A Fox host engaged in some seriously f*cked up wishful thinking on Tuesday and every American should be outraged.Bill O Reilly s original goon with a punchable face Jesse Watters smiled during an episode of The Five as he relished the idea of a terrorist attack in October that would scare voters into flocking to Donald Trump s campaign. If there s one more terror attack, maybe in October, this is gonna make Trump s plan look a lot more appealing,  Watters claimed.Yeah, that s right. A Trump-supporting Fox host just gave ISIS an idea for how they could seriously interfere with our democratic process. Watters literally talked about this evil October surprise as if it would be a good thing because it could help the Republican nominee beat Hillary Clinton in November.Fellow host Juan Williams was disgusted by Watters  remark and slammed him as  anti-American  for thinking of such a thing. Oh my god, what wishful thinking,  Williams responded.  Anti-American! That s unbelievable! Of course, Watters then played the victim. Why would you say that that s what I m thinking?  he asked.  How dare you? Williams demanded to know why Watters would put such a thought out into the world, especially since ISIS is likely watching. How dare you?  Watters whined again.  It s prudent political analysis,  he claimed. Oh that s what it was. I see,  Williams replied.  I thought it was desperation. No, I know about October surprises,  Watters arrogantly claimed.Here s the video via YouTube.This is about as despicable as it gets.Next month will be the 15th anniversary of the September 11th attacks in which nearly 3,000 Americans perished. And as ISIS continues to commit attacks around the world, Jesse Watters is thinking about how great it would be for Trump if only a terrorist attack could happen in this country specifically in October with the goal of affecting the outcome of the presidential election. It s one thing to talk about an October surprise, but Watters got specific and he smiled about it because he thinks it s an opportunity for Trump. This went beyond simple political analysis.Terrorist attacks kill people. They are bloody and violent. There is nothing funny or happy about a terrorist attack, especially at a time when Trump is calling for assassinating Hillary Clinton and claiming that the election is rigged. This election is tense enough as it is without Watters throwing the thought of a possible terrorist attack into the mix.Jesse Watters is sick and he should apologize to every American who has lost a loved one because of an act of terrorism. And he should apologize to America as a whole. Because what kind of American, what kind of human being smiles at the idea of a terrorist attack so that their political party can gain an advantage? This is unforgivable and Fox News should be ashamed for letting a prick like Watters step foot inside their studio.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 17, 2016",0,3012
" Former GOP Congressman TRASHES Paul Ryan: If Trump Were A Dem, You’d Impeach Him","Now that fired FBI Director James Comey has offered explosive testimony to the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate, Republicans are scrambling to defend Trump and try to make excuses for what could very well be obstruction of justice. Very few of them are willing to break ranks and criticize Trump, when they know damn well that if this were Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, they d be howling for impeachment posthaste. Well, there is one Republican who is willing to call them out on it: Former Congressman Bob Inglis.Rep. Inglis took to Twitter after a story was posted about House Speaker Paul Ryan claiming that he wouldn t impeach a Democrat if that person were to do the same things that Trump has engaged in. In a series of tweets, Inglis trashed Ryan for lying:.@SpeakerRyan you know this isn't true. You know that you would be inquiring into impeachment if this were a D. https://t.co/mBFn4aCGi4  Bob Inglis (@bobinglis) June 9, 2017.@SpeakerRyan, no, it isn't time to draft Articles of Impeachment. But it is time to pursue the Russia investigation with vigor.  Bob Inglis (@bobinglis) June 9, 2017.@SpeakerRyan and if the investigation leads to the Pres., his family or his campaign, so be it. Don't obstruct justice. Put country first.  Bob Inglis (@bobinglis) June 9, 2017Inglis is correct, of course. Elected Republicans are being craven, cowardly weasels right now. They are putting their party and their political futures ahead of their country while the nation and the world burn under Trump s criminal behavior, rank ignorance, and stunning incompetence. Further, if this were Hillary Clinton, they know they d be trying to find something   anything   to remove her from office. Hell, they d do that even if she didn t do anything wrong. In fact, House Oversight Chair Jason Chaffetz said that he had years of investigations lined up and waiting for Hillary when it seemed sure that she would win. They d be calling for her removal the second she took her hand off the Bible whether she did anything wrong or not. They ve admitted as much.In short, more elected Republicans need to grow a spine and admit the mistake they have made for the nation and the world, and do something about Donald Trump while we still have a nation left to save.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 11, 2017",0,2399
" Donald Trump Whines, Swears And Talks Cocktail Parties — In A Speech To Children","It s tough sometimes to imagine that Donald Trump has five children since it s clear from Monday s speech in front of 40,000 Boy Scouts and other attendees at the Boy Scouts Jamboree in West Virginia that he has absolutely no idea what kind of talk is appropriate for children.While most adults would take this opportunity to offer some pearls of adult wisdom or cheerlead the Boy Scouts toward their futures, Trump chose to deliver a tirade of Trumpisms.Like almost any time Trump has tried to string together more than a couple of words at a time, most of his speech was an inarticulate mess which consisted of his trademark whining, a wee bit of swearing and a pointless anecdote about a burned out rich guy at a cocktail party.In a string of what we might want to call Trump s greatest hits, toward the very beginning of his speech, he insulted President Obama and said he didn t want to talk about politics.  Who the hell wants to talk about politics when I m in front of the Boy Scouts?  Trump asked, but the answer, apparently, was Donald Trump. He talked about a lot of politics.Trump, to kids at Scout jamboree:  Who the hell wants to speak about politics when I m in front of the Boy Scouts?  https://t.co/Rz5Tko7WW8  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) July 24, 2017 By the way, just a question: Did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?  he asked as the crowd of scouts, scoutmasters, and various other adults gathered in West Virginia yelled the word  no.

Matchmaker Merkel seeks awkward three-way embrace,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened what promised to be marathon coalition talks on Friday, hoping to bring three opposing political camps into a stable government despite signs  there would be less money to paper over differences. Merkel said she was optimistic as she entered talks between her conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, despite an assessment by her own party that the next government would have less fiscal room than expected. The outcome of the talks is keenly awaited both at home and across Europe, with many fretting that the European Union could be rudderless with the bloc s longest-serving leader too busy to grapple with crucial issues like euro zone governance reform. Highlighting the challenge, a report by Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) found that there would be only 30 billion euros free for new projects over the next four years if parties stuck to their commitment to taking on no new debts. The shortfall will make all the more difficult the tricky three-way pact, dubbed a  Jamaica  coalition because the three parties  colors - black, yellow and green - match those of the Jamaican flag, which is untried at national level. Higher EU contributions as a result of Brexit and lower central bank profits might reduce spending room by some 15 billion euros, according to calculations seen by Reuters, an obstacle to the FDP s demands for tax cuts or the Greens  hope for environmental and infrastructure spending. The talks between Merkel s conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens are styled as  exploratory , but negotiators aim to get down to details of tax and budget policy in their first full meeting together.  There will be many differences,  she said on her arrival at the Berlin talks, adding:  There is readiness on my side to think about this creatively.  Party delegations each made five-minute presentations before breaking ahead of further discussions due on Tuesday. FDP chief Christian Lindner had earlier said that no matter how good the  atmosphere and seriousness  the parties were far apart on 85 percent of the material to be discussed. After, FDP secretary-general Nicola Beer said she continued to believe there was a  50:50  chance of a Jamaica coalition resulting. Merkel, weakened by a surging far-right in last month s national election, needs to make the awkward alliance fly as her previous  grand coalition  partners - the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) - say they want to rebuild in opposition after  their worst election result in more than half a century. Merkel has been able to steer Europe through its euro zone and refugee crises in part due to her dominance at home. Now that dominance is waning - her conservatives last month had their weakest election showing since 1949.  Voters have given these parties the task of governing,  wrote newspaper Die Welt.  These possible partners should not be giving the impression that they are inching warily toward each other like strangers in a crammed lift.  An Infratest Dimap poll for ARD showed 83 percent of Germans wanted the parties to find a compromise deal. Merkel, 63, has suffered two further setbacks since the national election: the CDU was defeated in a regional election in Lower Saxony on Sunday, and the party s premier in the eastern state of Saxony resigned on Wednesday, saying younger, fresher leadership was needed to revitalize the conservatives. Should the three party groups fail to form a coalition, some in their ranks fear this could lead to public disenchantment and fuel further support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered parliament for the first time last month. If she cannot clinch a three-way coalition pact, Merkel could try to form a minority government, or else call fresh elections - an unprecedented scenario. Alternatively, she could try to team up again with the SPD. The Social Democrats reject that option, though senior party official Thomas Oppermann has indicated they could reconsider on one condition: Merkel steps aside. ",worldnews,"October 20, 2017 ",1,4151
" BREAKING: GOP Chairman Grassley Has Had Enough, DEMANDS Trump Jr. Testimony","Donald Trump s White House is in chaos, and they are trying to cover it up. Their Russia problems are mounting by the hour, and they refuse to acknowledge that there are problems surrounding all of this. To them, it s  fake news,  or a  hoax.  However, the facts bear things out differently, and it seems that there are now cracks in the Congressional public leadership.Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, is fed up. He is now demanding that Donald Trump, Jr. and former 2016 Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort testify before his committee regarding the now infamous shady meeting between Donald Trump and the shady Russian lawyer who promised dirt on 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In fact, this information is due, well, NOW. This demand sends a few signals to team Trump   most notably that they should not fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller under any circumstances, despite the fact that it seems that this seems to be what Trump s White House is laying the groundwork, so to speak, to do as we speak.Here is the tweet regarding Grassley s warning:Also, anyone who thinks that Senator Grassley and the rest of the Senate are not serious about this only needs to look at the warning that has already been given: Trump Jr. and Manafort will either follow orders, or be served with subpoenas that force them to comply. If they refuse, they will be held in contempt of Congress, which carries with it serious jail time.Even the cruel, craven creatures within the GOP are sick of Donald Trump s corruption and his scandal-ridden White House. They are angry that he staged a hostile takeover of their party, first with birtherism and giving them a permanently racist label all while decimating all efforts that were made to pretend the Republican Party isn t a hotbed of racism, and while turning their worlds upside down, and with it, the nation. It seems that old-timers like Grassley, who are clearly sick of Trump s bullshit, just might be the ones who could save the republic.

TRUMP PROMISED TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST AND D.C. TREMBLED: “Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs” [VIDEO]," This wasn t a smooth-talking politician inviting us to climb aboard his fancy word ship for a voyage beyond the stars. He did not call upon the angels. Instead, he spoke in dark tones to the forgotten man. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,  Trump said.  Everyone is listening to you now. He began by punching the elites right in the mouth   the bipartisan Washington establishment sitting up there with him. For too long, a small group in our nation s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost,  Trump said.Trump s campaign was nothing if not audacious, but to see him say such things in front of the Capitol, right to the establishment s face as those sitting behind him wore those tight smiles, was beyond audacious. It was Jacksonian.You could feel Washington trembling. But you could also feel the establishment wise men   like Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the K Street boys who buy them all with campaign checks, Democrats and Republicans   smirking and telling themselves a Washington truth:Fresh presidents talk a lot about change, and finally, when they re not fresh anymore, the presidents leave town, humbled, while the insiders remain.It was that beginning that was astonishing, his declaration of war on the establishment, especially as they all sat there with him, with former Presidents Carter and Bush and Clinton and Obama looking on, outgoing first lady Michelle Obama frowning, Hillary Clinton icy and distant.Bush bobbed his head and smiled as if in pain. Bill Clinton s eyes were two frozen blue grapes, locked in a thousand-yard stare. But what he was looking at inside his own head, I wouldn t ever want to know. We ve defended other nations  borders while refusing to defend our own,  Trump said,  and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.   The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. The Bush Republicans and neoconservatives and European elites won t like his  America First  message one bit.Predictably, the left hated his speech. They love the working-class hero in the abstract, unless working-class heroes dare to support Trump. Then the left mocks them. The culture clash between liberal commentators and Trump voters has gotten so petty that I ve even seen Trump voters mocked as fools for spelling mistakes.They re not fools. They re not deplorable. They re hardworking Americans, people who sent their children to our wars, people who were pushed aside by our politics, slapped down by our economy and abused by Democrats, Republicans and the very elites who formed the establishment.They were once the forgotten.

"Obama to make historic trip to Cuba in coming weeks, official says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will visit Cuba in the coming weeks, a senior administration official said on Wednesday, making a historic trip in the final year of his presidency that will mark a turning point in U.S. relations with a long-time Cold War foe. The White House plans to announce the visit on Thursday. The Cuba stop will be part of a broader trip to Latin America. The visit to Havana by Obama would cap what administration officials see as one of his legacy foreign policy achievements: normalizing relations with Cuba and taking steps toward expanded commercial relations after a 54-year freeze.  Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro shocked the world in December 2014 by announcing the former adversaries would move to normalize relations. The Republican majority in Congress has defied Obama’s call to rescind the five-decade-old embargo, so he has used his executive authority to relax trade and travel restrictions. Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both sons of Cuban immigrants, have been sharply critical of his opening to Cuba in the absence of political change there. A visit by Obama to Havana in late March would correspond with the finalization of a peace deal for Colombia that was encouraged and sponsored by Castro. The Colombian government and the FARC rebel group are expected to finalize a peace deal by March 23 in Havana that would end a 50-year civil war in the South American nation. Obama said in a December interview with Yahoo News that he hoped to visit Cuba in 2016 but only if enough progress had been made in bilateral relations and he was able to meet political dissidents as part of an effort to “nudge the Cuban government in a new direction.”  A Cuban foreign ministry official said in reaction to the December interview that Obama was welcome to visit Cuba but not  meddle in its internal affairs. It was not immediately clear what detailed arrangements would be made for the trip or how diplomats from the two nations proposed to bridge that divide as part of the plans. Washington and Havana restored diplomatic ties in July but commerce remains limited by the U.S. trade embargo, which includes a ban on American tourism to the island. On Tuesday, American and Cuban officials signed an arrangement to restore scheduled air services between the two countries after half a century.  Rubio wasted no time in criticizing the reported plans for the trip. Asked at a CNN town hall event in South Carolina whether he would visit Cuba, Rubio replied: “Not if it’s not a free Cuba.” At the same event, Cruz also criticized Obama’s move, saying he would not go to Cuba “as long as the Castros are in power.” “What Obama has shown to our enemies is weakness and appeasement,” Cruz said, lumping together Obama’s steps toward improving U.S. relations with Cuba and Iran. “I think it’s a real mistake. I think the president instead ought to be pushing for a free Cuba,” he said. Instead, he will go and “essentially act as an apologist.” The last and only sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba was Calvin Coolidge in 1928. ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1,3172
Maine governor orders partial shutdown with budget in limbo,"(Reuters) - A budget impasse between Maine Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers triggered a shutdown of nonessential state services on Saturday, after the conservative Republican threatened to veto a bipartisan compromise reached by lawmakers. LePage has insisted on a budget with deeper spending cuts than those contemplated by lawmakers and has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes. “This is about the future of Maine. The Maine people are taxed enough. I will not tax them anymore and in my budget overall taxes were decreased,” LePage said in a statement announcing the partial shutdown, the first in the state since 1991. The governor’s order for a partial closure of state government went into effect at 12:01 a.m. local time after negotiations stalled over a $7.055 billion, two-year budget. A six-member bipartisan budget committee with lawmakers from the House and Senate had reached a deal on a proposed budget late on Thursday night, but LePage signaled he would veto the package because it included some tax increases. The Republican-controlled Senate passed the package by a 34-1 vote on Friday, and later in the day the Democratic-controlled House approved it by an 87-60 vote. But the margin of approval fell short of the two-thirds threshold needed to override LePage’s threatened veto. Even if two-thirds of the House voted for approval, state law gives the two-term governor up to 10 days to respond to the legislation, allowing for a partial shutdown during that time.  State police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue will continue to operate during the current shutdown, LePage has said. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Lawmakers met in the state capital Augusta on Saturday, but they had no formal counterproposal from the governor to consider, said Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon. “Right now we are in a very fluid situation where we don’t have anything in front of us,” Casale said by telephone. The stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure that voters approved in November to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. But it contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, Casale said, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million. ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2017 ",1,2440
Russia accuses CNN International of violating Russian media law,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s communications regulator on Friday accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating Russian media law and said it had summoned the broadcaster s representatives in connection with the matter. The Russian foreign ministry accused Washington on Thursday of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S operations of Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, and warned that Moscow could take tit-for-tat measures. President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of Russia s Security Council on Friday that Russian media outlets working abroad were facing growing and unacceptable pressure, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in a statement on its website that it would look at warning CNN about the alleged violations, which it said also breached the terms of its broadcast license. It did not say what breaches of Russian laws the U.S. broadcaster had made, adding it would continue its  systematic monitoring  of foreign mass media outlets registered in Russia. Asked if the regulator s move was politically motivated, Roskomnadzor head Alexander Zharov, was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying:  I don t work in a political agency. I work in a regulatory service.   Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday the U.S. authorities were demanding that Russian state-controlled broadcaster Russia Today (RT) be registered as a  foreign agent  in the United States. She said that move endangered the safety of the channel s staff, because it included an obligation to disclose their personal data.  In the atmosphere of a witch hunt unfolding in the United States, this may present a real threat,  she said. Putin, meeting permanent members of his Security Council,  touched upon the issue of ongoing and at times growing pressure on Russian mass media outlets in some foreign countries , Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  It was stressed that such pressure on Russian media is unacceptable,  he added. He did not name the countries where the Kremlin was concerned Russian media were coming under pressure.    The Foreign Ministry s Zakharova said any move made against Russian media working in the United States  will get a tit-for-tat response .  And who it falls on, this should be easy for Washington to work out. The clock is ticking,  she said at a weekly briefing on Thursday. ",worldnews,"September 29, 2017 ",1,2448
Little-known Republican becomes Trump liaison in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the U.S. Congress, says he talks to Donald Trump often, but the president-elect has tapped a little-known lawmaker from western New York to be his eyes and ears among congressional Republicans. In the latest example of how much Trump values personal loyalty, the billionaire businessman has effectively designated Representative Chris Collins to be the White House transition team’s congressional liaison.  Collins, 66, has been in Congress less than four years. He has no House leadership role. He chairs no committees. He was previously county executive for Erie County, New York. But Collins was the first lawmaker on Capitol Hill to endorse Trump’s presidential bid. He co-chaired Trump’s U.S. House Leadership Committee during the campaign. Collins said Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, announced the news about his role to fellow Republicans at a Tuesday caucus meeting. Ryan’s office had no immediate comment. Collins said he suggested the role to Trump the day after the Nov. 8 elections. “I said I’m going to stay in Congress. But I think I can be a bit of a liaison, if you will, of members, kind of making sure the administration knows exactly what’s going on,” he told reporters. Trump later mentioned the idea to Ryan, who asked Collins to do the job, according to Collins. Collins seconded Ryan’s renomination to the speakership on Tuesday, calling the gesture “a sign of Trump’s support for Mr. Ryan”. Analysts called the move unusual. “A new president generally relies on the leadership,” said Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. “But it’s not a role with a great deal of power and it’s not the same as being a conduit once Trump is president and working on policy.”   Collins’ official role is to serve as a conduit to the transition team for lawmakers who want to convey concerns or ideas for legislation and staffing. An aide said Collins has not participated in legislative discussions between House and Senate Republican leaders and the Trump team. Ryan told reporters on Tuesday that he and Trump are “on the same page, we’re working hand in glove.”  But the two have not always seen eye to eye. Ryan was slow to endorse Trump for president and once described his comments about a judge of Mexican heritage as “the textbook definition of racism”. Trump has slammed Ryan as “a very weak and ineffective leader.” ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1,2482
"U.N. seeks report from Myanmar on rapes, deaths of Rohingya women","GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations women s rights panel called on Myanmar on Tuesday to report within six months on rapes and sexual violence against Rohingya women and girls by its security forces in northern Rakhine state and measures taken to punish soldiers. The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) also asked authorities to provide details on women and girls killed in the violence since the army crackdown began in late August. The campaign, which followed attacks on police posts by Rohingya insurgents, has driven more than 600,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh and left their villages burned to the ground. The rare request for an  exceptional report  from a country was only the panel s fourth since 1982.  We request an exceptional report from a state when a situation of grave, massive and systematic violations occur and these issues are relevant to mandate of the Committee,  panel member Nahla Haidar told Reuters.  The exceptional report is also like a red flag,  she said. The move aimed to help Myanmar authorities  get out of the tunnel of this recent conflict which has really set back Myanmar which was going on the right foot to democratisation , she said.  The U.N. watchdog panel, composed of 23 independent experts, set a six-month deadline for the government to submit the report to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.  The Committee requested information concerning cases of sexual violence, including rape, against Rohingya women and girls by State security forces; and to provide details on the number of women and girls who have been killed or have died due to other non-natural causes during the latest outbreak of violence,  it said in a statement. Haider said:  Essentially it s rape, sexual violence which amounts to torture in certain cases for girls and women. And gang-raping also was documented...And yes, torture - rapes used as a systematic weapon of war . The experts requested information on  investigations, arrests, prosecutions, convictions and sentences or disciplinary measures imposed on perpetrators, including members of the armed forces, found guilty of such crimes.  Specifically, they sought information on the battalions that have undertaken the  clearance operations  in northern Rakhine state since August 25  and under whose command . They asked whether instructions have been given or are being issued to all branches of state security forces that torture, sexual violence and expulsions are banned  and that those responsible will be prosecuted and punished . The panel said it wanted to know how many Rohingya women and girls are being detained by security forces.  Pope Francis on Tuesday urged the leaders of majority-Buddhist Myanmar, mired in a crisis over the fate of Muslim Rohingya people, to commit themselves to justice, human rights and respect for  each ethnic group and its identity .

More Democratic senators oppose Trump's U.S. Supreme Court pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democrats on Friday stepped closer to having enough votes to block a confirmation vote on President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee with three more Democratic senators coming out against Neil Gorsuch for the lifetime job as a justice. Democrats are attempting use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster that requires 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote in the 100-seat U.S. Senate. Senate Republicans are hoping to vote on April 7 to confirm the conservative appeals court judge nominated by the Republican president in January.  Democratic Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii came out against Gorsuch on Friday and backed a filibuster. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. But if Democrats can muster 41 votes, they would be able to sustain the filibuster. As of Friday afternoon, 36 Democrats had indicated their support for such a move. Two Democrats have said they support Gorsuch. Another two have voiced opposition to Gorsuch but have not made clear whether they would support a filibuster to block a confirmation vote.  Seven Democrats and one independent, Angus King of Maine, who usually votes with them, have not yet announced their position. If Democrats amass enough support to block a confirmation vote, it would force Republican Senate leaders to try to change the chamber’s long-standing rules and allow confirmation by a simple majority, a move backed by Trump that is sometimes called the “nuclear option.” If confirmed by the Senate to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Gorsuch would reinstate the nine-seat high court’s conservative majority at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House. McCaskill said in a statement she could not support Gorsuch because a study of his legal opinions revealed “a rigid ideology that always puts the little guy under the boot of corporations.” McCaskill is up for re-election next year in a state Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. Blumenthal, a member of the Judiciary Committee that held a four-day confirmation hearing last week and will vote on sending the nomination to the Senate floor on Monday, said in a statement Gorsuch has not been forthcoming with senators about his views on key issues, leaving his core beliefs little known.  “Instead he has evaded real answers at every turn,” Blumenthal said. “We must assume that Judge Gorsuch has passed the Trump litmus test - a pro-life, pro-gun, conservative judge.” Blumenthal said Gorsuch’s refusal to “distance himself from right-wing groups” raised questions about whether he may be “an acolyte of hard-right special interests.” Schatz said Gorsuch’s record as a judge was troubling and he had not shown he would challenge executive overreach.  “His refusal to answer questions on long-decided cases or condemn attacks on the judiciary during the hearing demonstrates that he is outside of the legal mainstream,” Schatz said.     Their statements came one day after Gorsuch won his first Democratic support, giving Republicans who control the chamber two of the eight Democratic votes they need to break a filibuster. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Democrats who face re-election in states that voted for Trump last year, said they would vote for Gorsuch. Trump made the appointment of conservative jurists to the Supreme Court a key promise during the 2016 presidential election. Republicans have defended Gorsuch as well qualified to be a Supreme Court justice and praised his performance during the confirmation hearings.  If the filibuster is beaten, the confirmation vote itself would require a simple majority. Some Democrats have accused Republicans of “stealing” a Supreme Court seat last year when the Senate refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, appellate judge Merrick Garland.

 WATCH: Al Sharpton Catches John McCain Acting Exactly Like Donald Trump Toward Immigrants,"Senator John McCain just got outed as a hypocrite with a damning video that shows him acting just like Donald Trump   even though he blames the presumptive GOP nominee for hurting him among Hispanic voters.Last week, the Arizona Republican complained to private donors that Donald Trump s rhetoric against Hispanics is making his re-election bid difficult. I do not take my primary opponent lightly,  McCain said. He continued: But have no doubt that if it is Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona   with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote   I have no doubt that this may be the race of my life. People are angry. They re upset. They feel that there s this disconnect and all of that and frankly there s an element of nativism in it as well, as you know. McCain is all of a sudden worried about the Hispanic vote because Trump has accused Hispanic immigrants of being rapists and murderers, all while promising to build an expensive wall along the entire southern border to keep immigrants out of the United States.But as it turns out, McCain is apparently pretending that he is totally different from Trump.Because in 2010, McCain used the exact same rhetoric in a campaign ad that makes it clear that he should blame himself for any troubles with Hispanic voters he will experience in November.MSNBC host Al Sharpton caught McCain being a hypocrite, so he played the video during an interview with McCain s Democratic challenger Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick.In the ad, McCain is walking along the border with a local sheriff.  Drug and human smuggling, home invasions, murder,  he says. The sheriff uses the term  illegals  to describe desperate undocumented immigrants fleeing violence in their countries of origin for a better life in America. John McCain then concludes by calling to  complete the dang fence. Here s the video via YouTube. Blaming immigrants for murder, for home invasions, vowing to, quote, complete the fence. I mean, this is John NcCain,  Sharpton said. Is there that much difference that you see there between what he s saying and what Trump is saying about building a wall?  he asked Kirkpatrick.Kirkpatrick agreed, saying that John McCain changed his position again as he often does  depending on who he is talking to. He s not a straight shooter,  she continued.  He s not a maverick. He doesn t stand for anything. Here s the video via YouTube.Looks like John McCain has some explaining to do.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 9, 2016",0,2564
Democrats plot uphill fight against some Trump nominations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats plan to fight some of President-elect Donald Trump’s choices for top administration jobs, but history and the party’s minority status in the chamber are not on their side. A simple majority of 51 votes is needed in the 100-member Senate to confirm nominations. Louisiana will select its newest senator on Saturday. If the Republicans, as expected, hold on to the seat, they will control at least 52 seats in the chamber next year. Senate Republicans said on Thursday they were confident of winning Cabinet confirmations early next year. Nonetheless, some Democrats said they hoped to persuade a few Republicans to help them block a Trump nominee or two, following the Republican Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, when a newly installed Senate starts reviewing his nominations. That could be just brave talk from Democrats. The Senate has rejected only nine of 719 Cabinet nominations in U.S. history, not counting nominees who have withdrawn when facing certain defeat, according to congressional records. The last rejection was in 1989, when the Senate blocked Republican President George H.W. Bush’s nomination of Senator John Tower to be defense secretary. In 2013, Democratic President Barack Obama had trouble getting Chuck Hagel confirmed as defense secretary, but he ultimately prevailed. This time around, Democrats said their top targets included  U.S. Representative Tom Price as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Former New York investment banker and hedge fund investor Steven Mnuchin, tapped by Trump to become Treasury secretary, is also drawing the ire of Democrats, who will be in the minority in both the new Senate and House of Representatives in 2017. Trump’s path toward Senate confirmations of nominees will be easier than the one faced by most of his predecessors. In 2013, Senate Democrats, frustrated by Republicans blocking Obama’s choices for federal judges, used their majority status at the time to eliminate “filibusters” against executive and judicial branch nominations, except the Supreme Court. That meant only 51 votes were needed for confirmations, rather than 60. Pruitt is a climate change skeptic who has participated in lawsuits trying to stop the EPA from carrying out clean-air regulations. As a nominee, he will embody “the fossil fuel and anti-clean air and clean water movement. ... I like those odds,” Democratic Senator Edward Markey said of the fight ahead. In 2009, when in the House, Markey was a leader in the fight for legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who was an ally at the time in that failed battle, said in a brief interview that while he did not know Pruitt: “I appreciate his passion for fighting back against things he thought were an overreach” by federal agencies. Price is high on the Democrats’ target list, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide, who asked not to be identified,  Defending Medicare, the federal healthcare program for the elderly, is a top priority of congressional Democrats. Price supports limiting some Medicare benefits. He also opposes government funding for women’s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood. That could help Democrats win support for blocking Price from moderate Republicans such as Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski, the senior aide said. A spokeswoman for Murkowski said she had not expressed an opinion on the Price nomination. Collins and her aides were not immediately available for comment. A second senior Senate Democratic aide said some Republicans up for re-election in 2018 could be uncomfortable voting for Price because of his Medicare stance. But Graham said Price “has been the heart and soul of the Republican alternative to Obamacare. I can’t imagine any Republican voting against him.” Republican Senator Jeff Sessions has been chosen by Trump to be attorney general. Democrats plan to highlight his hardline stances on illegal immigration, as well as remind colleagues that a Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations that he had made racist remarks, which he denied. If the debate stokes strong opposition to Sessions,   Republicans might have to scramble to win his confirmation. That could especially be true if the Alabama lawmaker follows a long-held practice of senators of merely voting “present” on their own confirmations, meaning Democrats would be one vote closer to defeating him.

I sort of jumped.  I haven t had an abortion,  I told her. I wanted to make it really clear to her that as much as I was going out and fighting for other women s options, I myself had never had an abortion.And I realized then that even I was carrying within myself stigma around this issue. Even I, the woman who cares as much as anybody about a woman s right to choose, felt it was important that people know I was unblemished in this department. So many people I love   my mother, my best friends   have had to have abortions for all kinds of reasons,  Dunham said.  I feel so proud of them for their bravery, for their self-knowledge, and it was a really important moment for me then to realize I had internalized some of what society was throwing at us and I had to put it in the garbage.

 Republicans Just Granted Themselves Special Status In Their Latest Healthcare Bill,"If you have a pre-existing condition, Obamacare currently protects you from being turned down for insurance on the basis of that condition. Republicans want to take that away because insuring sick people just eats too much profit, and healthcare is a privilege, not a right anyway. The latest iteration of their ridiculous healthcare plan will allow states to decide whether insurers have to cover people with pre-existing conditions, because of course it does, but it also contains a brand-new amendment that s patently disgusting.It carves an exemption out for members of Congress and their staffs. Insurers would still be required to provide coverage for them regardless of pre-existing conditions. Vox confirmed it last night: A spokesperson for Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) who authored this amendment confirmed this was the case: members of Congress and their staff would get the guarantee of keeping these Obamacare regulations. But don t Republicans hate Obamacare? Well, their relationship with Obamacare is actually considerably more complex than we tend to give it credit for. Contrary to popular belief, we taxpayers don t subsidize Congress  health insurance the way many people think. In fact, we never did. Until 2013, they were covered under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, which is a health insurance marketplace where they (and every other federal employee) purchase health insurance with all the same bullshit as everyone else, and have their premiums taken out of their paychecks.The Office of Personnel Management contributes to each employee s premium, but where private sector employers cover an average of 83 percent of their employees  premiums (or 72 percent for family plans), OPM covers 72 to 75 percent, whichever is less depending on a variety of factors, across the board.In 2013, all of Congress was kicked off of FEHB thanks to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). He proposed an amendment to the ACA that would require all members of Congress to purchase health insurance through the exchanges, and for their staffs under the small business provision.So that s what they ve been doing for health insurance for the last four years. Where their own lives are concerned, Obamacare s popular provisions are good things. Where the rest of the country is concerned, though, well, we all know how they feel about the rest of us. The prohibition on denying insurance due to pre-existing conditions is one of the most popular provisions and they want to gut it.For everyone but themselves.Can they get any more obvious about where their true priorities lie?Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 26, 2017",0,2715

"Nothing should change, says Britain in bid for post-Brexit security pact","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain proposed a new post-Brexit security treaty with the European Union on Monday, seeking to maintain and intensify cooperation to thwart  ever-growing and increasingly cross-border threats . In its sixth policy paper setting out Britain s vision for ties with the EU after it quits the bloc in March 2019, the government said it wanted to keep the benefits of EU security cooperation, arguing it was in both parties  interests to do so. The proposal comes days after a blast on a packed commuter underground train injured 30 people in west London, Britain s fifth major attack this year.   We already have a deep level of collaboration with the EU on security matters and it is in both our interests to find ways to maintain it,  Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.  A new security treaty with the EU would be underpinned by our shared principles, and should make sure our partnership has the agility to respond to the ever-changing threats we face.  The paper said an entirely new form of agreement on security was necessary because there was no satisfactory precedent for security cooperation between the EU and non-EU states, and that relying on existing models would diminish British and EU defenses. Britain has published a series of  future partnership  policy papers to try to nudge talks with the EU forward, after they have stalled over the divorce settlement, especially over the so-called Brexit bill. Security cooperation is seen by government officials as one of their strongest arguments to gain leverage in the complicated talks to unravel more than 40 years of union. Seeking to ram that point home, Monday s paper simultaneously stressed Britain s importance to EU security, and the need for continued cooperation to respond to future threats as they evolve. Interior minister Amber Rudd said Britain was one of the leading EU contributors to a range of measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol.  Recent events in the UK and across Europe have shown the criminal and terrorist threats we face are varied and increasingly international. The long-standing collaboration we have with our European partners allows us to jointly address these threats and keep our citizens safe,  she said.  As we prepare to leave the EU it is therefore vital that we agree a new way to ensure continued security, law enforcement and criminal justice cooperation,  Rudd said. The document did not rule out Britain seeking membership of police agency Europol and other bodies, or using the European Arrest Warrant which provides fast-track extradition. Its focus, however, was finding a way to keep the  operational capabilities  provided by those instruments. ",worldnews,"September 18, 2017 ",1,2827

South Africa's Ramaphosa gets most nominations ahead of ANC leadership vote,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has received the most nominations for leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) ahead of a party vote this month, voting data from the country s nine provinces show. Ramaphosa is one of two frontrunners in a closely watched contest to take over from President Jacob Zuma as ANC leader at a party conference starting on Dec. 16. Whoever becomes ANC leader will most likely be the next president of South Africa, owing to the ruling party s electoral dominance. Ramaphosa received 1,862 nominations by ANC branches, whereas his main rival for ANC leader, former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, received 1,309 endorsements. Reuters compiled the number of nominations for each candidate based on voting data released by provincial ANC structures. ANC officials in the provinces of Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal were the last to release their nominations totals on Monday. Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader and millionaire businessman, is seen as more market-friendly than Dlamini-Zuma, who was previously married to Zuma. Signs that Ramaphosa has been doing well in the nominations by ANC branches have boosted the rand currency in recent weeks. However, Dlamini-Zuma could still win the race for ANC leader as analysts say the outcome in December could be swayed by inducements and pressure on conference delegates.  Delegates are not bound to vote for the candidate that was nominated by their ANC branch. ",worldnews,"December 4, 2017 ",1,1572

Peru's Congress prepares to oust President Kuczynski,"LIMA (Reuters) - President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski s chances of surviving the political crisis gripping Peru faded on Friday after Congress passed a motion to start  presidential vacancy  procedures with enough votes to unseat him within a week. The opposition-controlled Congress voted 93-17 on Friday to seek his removal from office over graft allegations, which he denies. Eighty-seven votes will be needed to oust him in a session scheduled for Dec. 21, when he will be asked to defend himself. A Brazilian construction company at the center of Latin America s biggest graft scandal disclosed this week payments totaling $4.8 million to companies owned by Kuczynski or a close friend, triggering calls for him to resign. Kuczynski had previously denied any links to the Brazilian company, Odebrecht, and said on Thursday there was nothing improper about the payments. Flanked by his Cabinet, Kuczynski vowed not to resign in a defiant message to the nation. However, Kuczynski was aware his chances of surviving the scandal were slim, said a government source who asked not be identified. By resisting calls to step down, he hopes to clear his name and defend due process as the Odebrecht graft investigation widens, the source said.  This is a national disgrace,  said opposition lawmaker Lourdes Alcorta.  The less harmful option for Peru would be his resignation. He s forcing us to impeach him.  Odebrecht has rocked politics in Latin America since agreeing a year ago to provide details on bribery schemes across the region - landing elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic and nearly toppling a president in Brazil. Two former presidents in Peru, Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, have been ensnared in the Odebrecht probe over alleged payments they deny. Humala was jailed pending trial in July and authorities are seeking Toledo s extradition from the United States. Opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, whom Kuczynski unexpectedly defeated in last year s presidential election, is also under investigation and denies wrongdoing. If Kuczynski is forced out, he would be replaced by First Vice President Martin Vizcarra, a former governor of a copper-rich mining region and Peru s current ambassador to Canada. Kuczynski was once lauded by many as a brilliant technocrat who would help uproot widespread corruption in Peru. But his 16 months in office have been marked by clashes with the right-wing opposition party that controls Congress. Kuczynski said late on Thursday he was the owner, but not the manager, of a company paid by Odebrecht while he held senior government posts. He also acknowledged providing financial services for an Odebrecht project as a consultant for a friend s firm when he did not hold public office. The opposition slammed the explanation as too little, too late.  It s really unfortunate that President Kuczynski has put the country in this situation,  said congresswoman Cecilia Chacon.

 GOP Sent Armed Agents To Harass Clinton Aide And Used Your Tax Dollars To Do It,"Republicans in Congress used tax dollars to send armed agents to harass a former aide to Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the never-ending fishing expedition into Clinton s emails.Bryan Pagliano was a tech aide who helped to set up the server for Clinton s emails, and has made top Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee angry because he is asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuses to testify.It is unclear why they need his testimony. The FBI and Department of Justice have already determined that Clinton s use of the email server does not warrant prosecution.But Republicans on the committee decided to flex their muscle anyways:But when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoenaed Pagliano last week, his lawyers said he would again assert his Fifth Amendment rights. They added that he was willing to meet with the committee in private to make that assertion, but was unwilling to do so under the glare of television cameras in a public event.That prompted Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) to dispatch the armed marshals with a fresh subpoena last Friday, Chaffetz revealed in Thursday s hearing. To clear up any ambiguity created by Mr. Pagliano s six lawyers about whether they would confirm service of the prior subpoenas   which they refused to do   we had the U.S. marshals personally serve him,  Chaffetz said.The political stunt was slammed by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) who said,  This served no purpose but to harass and intimidate Mr. Pagliano. The chairman ordered this action in secret, without even notifying Democratic committee members of his plan.  No consultation, no debate, no vote. Republicans have sought to use their control of congress as a government funded super PAC to attack Clinton. In addition to her emails, Republicans have created multiple committees investigating the attack on U.S. personnel in Benghazi. All of these committees have cleared Clinton and President Obama of wrongdoing, but the GOP leadership insists on wasting more and more money on these cases.And it is all financed by taxpayers.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 24, 2016",0,2238

Critics urge WHO to reverse choice of Mugabe as goodwill envoy,"GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) should overturn its decision to appoint Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador, global health leaders said on Saturday, describing the move as unjustifiable and wrong. Britain said Mugabe s appointment was  surprising and disappointing  and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO s global work. The United States, which has imposed sanctions on Mugabe for alleged human rights violations, said it was  disappointed.   This appointment clearly contradicts the United Nations  ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity,  a U.S. State Department spokesperson said.   This selection underscores why the United States continues to push for U.N. reform and leadership actions that uphold our shared U.N. ideals.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday. The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister. In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as  a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide health care to all . The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO s first African director-general, added:  Today I am also honored to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.  But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was  shocked and deeply concerned  to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe s  long track record of human rights violations . Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was  deeply disappointing and wrong  and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.  Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,  Farrar said.  Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,  he said. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency s work.   Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,  he said by e-mail.  Human rights activists also criticized the move.  Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as  sickening .  The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa   and its health system   into a basket-case,  he said. He noted that Mugabe himself had traveled to Singapore for medical treatment three times this year rather than in his homeland. ",worldnews,"October 21, 2017 ",1,3226
 Rosie O’Donnell Writes Powerful Poem That Perfectly Sums Up Donald Trump (TWEET),"If anyone knows what it s like to be attacked by the likes of Donald Trump, it s Rosie O Donnell. The bitter feud between the two goes back years, and it should have been made clear then how much of a cruel and creepy misogynist he truly is.

However, it s really no different than he s always been if we looked past his celebrity to actually watch and listen.In a poem she posted to her website, Rosie O Donnell wrote about Donald Trump. The piece really encapsulates everything that is the real estate mogul and failed businessman.

Former Fox News chief Ailes is not advising Trump: campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman ousted last month after sexual harassment allegations, is not advising Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before the presidential debates in the fall, the campaign said on Tuesday. “He is not advising Mr. Trump or helping with debate prep. They are longtime friends but he has no formal or informal role in the campaign,” the campaign said.  Earlier, the New York Times had reported that Ailes was advising Trump ahead of the Sept. 26 first presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in a role that could stretch beyond the initial Long Island, New York debate.  Ailes resigned from his post as chairman and chief executive of Fox News Channel last month, ending his 20-year reign over the conservative cable news channel, after Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson sued the 76-year-old claiming sexual harassment.  Trump has spoken highly of Ailes in the past, calling him “a great guy” in a tweet last month.  ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1,1047

Argentina intensifies search for missing submarine with 44 crew,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An Argentine submarine with 44 crew on board was missing in the South Atlantic two days after its last communication, prompting the navy to step up its search efforts late on Friday in difficult, stormy conditions.  The ARA San Juan was in the southern Argentine sea 432 km (268 miles) from the Patagonian coast when it sent its last signal on Wednesday, naval spokesman Enrique Balbi said.  The emergency operation was formally upgraded to a search-and-rescue procedure on Friday evening after no visual or radar contact was made with the submarine, Balbi said.   Detection has been difficult despite the quantity of boats and aircraft  involved in the search, Balbi said, noting that heavy winds and high waves were complicating efforts.   Obviously, the number of hours that have passed - two days in which there has been no communication - is of note.  The navy believes the submarine, which left Ushuaia en route to the coastal city of Mar del Plata in Buenos Aires province, had communication difficulties that may have been caused by an electrical outage, Balbi said. Navy protocol would call for the submarine to come to the surface once communication was lost.   We expect that it is on the surface,  Balbi said.  The German-built submarine, which uses diesel-electric propulsion, was inaugurated in 1983, making it the newest of the three submarines in the navy s fleet, according to the navy. President Mauricio Macri said the government was in contact with the crew s families.  We share their concern and that of all Argentines,  he wrote on Twitter.  We are committed to using all national and international resources necessary to find the ARA San Juan submarine as soon as possible.  Argentina accepted an offer from the United States for a NASA P-3 explorer aircraft, which had been stationed in the southern city of Ushuaia and was preparing to depart to Antarctica, to fly over the search area, Balbi said. A Hercules C-130 from the Argentine Air Force was also flying over the operational area. Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Britain and South Africa had also formally offered assistance.

"As Germans clip Merkel's wings, Brussels braces for turbulence","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Cheers from Angela Merkel s conservative allies in Brussels at her re-election on Sunday belie wider unease at how the German chancellor will deal with an awkward new coalition and a surge in support for the far-right.  With Angela Merkel, Germany remains the strong and reliable partner in Europe,  tweeted Manfred Weber, a Merkel ally who leads the biggest party bloc in the European Parliament. But one source in the European People s Party saw trouble ahead in her need to replace her battered Social Democrat  grand coalition  partners with an alliance of both the left-leaning Greens and the resurgent, economically hawkish liberals of the FDP.  Things worked very smoothly with the socialists,  the EPP source said.  Now, you don t know what s going to happen.  The broad expectation is for a  Jamaica  coalition   the country s flag comprises the three parties  colors. Martin Selmayr, German chief-of-staff to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, sent a tweet consisting only of three flags: Jamaica s green, yellow and black flanked by two blue EU banners   a reflection of hope in Brussels of continued EU commitment from Berlin that some fear may now be problematic. One casualty of Merkel s weakness may be a rapid move to deepen integration of the euro zone along lines that new French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to outline on Tuesday. Those plans, as with reform proposals floated this month by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, may run into increased scepticism in Berlin, where many are wary of what they see as more demands for German bailouts of states like Greece. Resistance may come both from Merkel s Christian Democrats, spooked by the surge on their right flank, where Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered parliament as the third biggest party, and from the Free Democrats (FDP), whose leader Christian Lindner ruled out Germany contributing to a shared euro zone budget. The liberal leader in the European Parliament, committed federalist and former Belgian premier Guy Verhofstadt, said he hoped for a  pro-European  coalition to push EU integration. The FDP leader in the EU legislature, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, said it was  an open-minded, pro-European party . The European Greens  German co-chair Reinhard Butikofer said his party wanted to strengthen the European Union,  making use of the window of opportunity that exists ... between Paris, Brussels and Berlin . He was referring to a keynote speech by Juncker 10 days ago in which the EU chief executive said anti-EU populists were in retreat and called for deeper EU integration. But Guntram Wolff, the German director of the Brussels think-tank Bruegel, questioned Juncker s thinking. He forecast a rightward shift in Germany due to the AfD and resistance from the FDP that would stymie Macron and Juncker s grand visions.  Populism definitely not dead,  Wolff tweeted.  Juncker speech completely miscalculated the situation.  ",worldnews,"September 24, 2017 ",1,3042

Cambodian PM leaves for China to seek more aid,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, facing Western donor pressure over a crackdown on critics ahead of 2018 elections, will seek more aid and investment from China during a visit this week, his aide said on Wednesday. China is already Cambodia s biggest donor and its support has bolstered Hun Sen in the face of criticism of what his opponents say amounts to the destruction of democracy. The aide, Sry Thamrong, said Hun Sen would attend a special summit from Thursday to Sunday held by the ruling Communist Party on a theme espoused by Chinese President Xi Jinping on turning the world for the better and without interference.  The aim of Hun Sen s meetings to discuss aid and investment with Xi and Chinese investors is to create more jobs in Cambodia, he said.  Especially, we need more bridges on the Mekong River, we also need many more roads, trains, sky train,  Sry Thamrong told reporters at the international airport in Phnom Penh, the capital, before the departure.  These are the things we need in the future.   China has supported Cambodia s crackdown, making no criticism of the government, which is one of Beijing s most important allies in Southeast Asia after more than three decades in power.     The supreme court this month banned the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) at the government s request. That followed the arrest of its leader Kem Sokha for plotting to take power with American help. The United States has stopped election funding ahead of next year s general election and threatened further concrete steps. The European Union has raised a potential threat to Cambodia s duty free access. Washington is working on a review of its ties with Cambodia after the dissolution of the CNRP, William Heidt, the U.S. ambassador to Cambodia said.   That is something we are taking very seriously, having a very serious review of our policies towards Cambodia,  he told broadcaster Voice of America in an interview on Wednesday.

 WHOOPS: Right-Wing Spy Caught By Democratic Senate Campaign,"A right-wing activist secretly spying on a Democratic senate campaign was exposed. The caper was exposed by quick thinking volunteers working for Russ Feingold s U.S. Senate campaign in Wisconsin who were suspicious of a blonde woman with a pickup truck that apparently gave them a fake name. Via The Huffington Post:The woman, who identified herself as Allison Moss, told Feingold staffers that she had been active in College Democrats at the University of Minnesota and wanted to get involved in the campaign. She also signed a nondisclosure agreement with the campaign under the same name.But after a Feingold staffer began pressing Moss on some of her past work, her backstory started unraveling. The staffer said someone on the campaign had gone to the University of Minnesota and remembered Moss as a member of the College Republicans. Moss denied being involved. They also asked her whether she worked for the right-wing group Campus Reform and whether she gave a false name on her nondisclosure agreement.The Huffington Post goes on to report that in audio of a question and answer session with the woman she  was nervous and evasive, giving answers that certainly aren t typical of the usual enthusiastic political volunteer. The outlet said the woman actually appears to be Allison Maass, a correspondent for the right-wing site Campus Reform, which has been the source of a steady stream of right-wing stories about  liberal  college life.Maas also reportedly was caught earlier in the year in an attempt to entrap volunteers for Hillary Clinton presidential campaign in a scheme that would have claimed the campaign was accepting illegal donations.Campus Reform is part of the Leadership Institute, the right wing incubator that trains conservative activists, including video hoaxster James O Keefe who worked with the Breitbart site and Fox News to attack the community service group ACORN. O Keefe s techniques were also used in order to attack Planned Parenthood with deceptively edited videos that claimed the organization sold  baby parts.

Putin turned Russia election hacks in Trump's favor: U.S. officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin supervised his intelligence agencies’ hacking of the U.S. presidential election and turned it from a general attempt to discredit American democracy to an effort to help Donald Trump, three U.S. officials said on Thursday. U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia tried to influence the election by hacking people and institutions, including Democratic Party bodies, has angered President-elect Trump, who says he won the Nov. 8 vote fairly. Russian officials have denied accusations of interference in the U.S. election. Separately, a senior White House official said on Thursday that Putin was likely to have been aware of the cyber attacks but he fell short of accusing the Russian president.       “I don’t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,” Ben Rhodes, the White House’s deputy national security adviser, told MSNBC. “When you’re talking about a significant cyber intrusion like this, we’re talking about the highest levels of government.” The U.S. officials - who have knowledge of intelligence information on the matter - said on the condition of anonymity that the hacking of U.S. political groups and figures had a more general focus at first. “This began merely as an effort to show that American democracy is no more credible than Putin’s version is,” one of the officials said. “It gradually evolved from that to publicizing (Hillary) Clinton’s shortcomings and ignoring the products of hacking Republican institutions, which the Russians also did,” the official said. By the fall, the official said, it became an effort to help Trump’s campaign because “Putin believed he would be much friendlier to Russia, especially on the matter of economic sanctions” than Democratic rival Clinton. Democratic President Barack Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio that the United States will take action against Russia. “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action and we will,” he said according to excerpts of the Thursday interview released by NPR. “At a time and a place of our own choosing. Some of it may be ... explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. ... Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it,” Obama said. NBC reported earlier that U.S. intelligence officials have “a high level of confidence” Putin was personally involved in the Russian cyber campaign against the United States. Hacked emails of Democratic operatives and Clinton aides were leaked during the presidential campaign, and at times dominated the news agenda. The U.S. officials said Russia also hacked Republicans but did little to nothing with the information they found.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state TV channel Rossiya-24 that he was “dumbstruck” by the NBC report of Putin’s alleged involvement. “I think this is just silly, and the futility of the attempt to convince somebody of this is absolutely obvious,” he said. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has brushed off reports of Russian hacking of U.S. political institutions.         “If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter on Thursday. In fact, the U.S. government did formally accuse Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against U.S. political organizations in October - one month ahead of the election. Obama last week ordered a review by the U.S. intelligence agencies about foreign interference in the 2016 election. Asked on Thursday about the hacks, Secretary of State John Kerry described how Obama had been considering the evidence ahead of the October announcement. “The president made the decision based on the input that was carefully, carefully vetted by the intelligence community ... that he did have an obligation to go out to the country and give a warning. And he did so,” Kerry said at a news briefing.              The three U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters said the fact that Putin oversaw a hacking operation was not surprising and is standard operating procedure in Russia. “If anything, given his background as a KGB officer, Putin has a much tighter grip on all Russian intelligence operations, civilian and military, foreign and domestic, than any democratic leader does,” one official said. The reports of Russian hacking have raised concerns among both political parties in Congress, with top Republicans breaking with Trump to call for closer scrutiny. Some Republican lawmakers have also questioned Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, who has close business ties to the Russian government.

 It Looks Like The Trump Campaign Just Got This Reporter Arrested,"While Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of being crooked and freedom hating, a member of the press was arrested at a his Houston rally after simply inquiring about press credentials.Alex Thompson of Vice News was arrested at the Omni Westside hotel for  trespassing.  Thompson, inquiring as to whether or not his pending press credentials had been approved or denied, entered the hotel lobby to ask members of Trump s communications staff what the final say was.According to Vice News:A man who identified himself as a hotel manager then asked Thompson to leave and warned that he would be arrested if he did not. Roughly two minutes later, without further warning and while Thompson was waiting for a member of Trump s staff to clarify his access to the event, he was arrested by Houston Police, handcuffed, and escorted outside. Thompson spoke with his editors while handcuffed and said that he was never given any opportunity to explain himself to police.And just like that, a reporter was arrested for requesting an answer to his ability to report on the rally, which is his constitutional right.Ryan McCarthy, editor-in-chief of Vice, tweeted:Our reporter @AlxThomp was arrested today outside a Trump event   for doing his job https://t.co/kS2PG5Igyc  Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) September 17, 2016Of course the Trump campaign denied any knowing or involvement of the incident, saying,  The campaign was not involved in this incident or aware of the details surrounding it. The event organizers were responsible for today s media presence and requested the campaign limit attendance to the traveling pool. Thompson was released on bond overnight, and the Houston police claimed that he issued an ultimatum: arrest him or leave him alone, because he is not leaving until he gets an answer, as he   a member of the press   is entitled to.Vice has hinted that their lawyers are working on getting the charges dropped.Given Trump and his campaign s hostility to the media (which includes threatening to sue the New York Times, tightening libel laws, and calling CNN panelists a bunch of losers), could having a reporter arrested seem too far out there? The answer is no.Whether or not Trump or anyone in his campaign made the call is not know. But we do know this much: the campaign had his credentials pending; he inquired but to no avail; he inquired again, and was arrested for  trespassing,  even though the event was public.Trump is no friend of the press, or the freedom of the press to report on the asinine and ridiculous things he and his supporters cough up.

 South Dakota Republican Rigs Upcoming Election For Herself By Personally Purging Democratic Voters,"This is a clear case of election-rigging.South Dakota Secretary of State Shantel Krebs is running for Congress in 2018. But rather than win the votes of the people fair and square, Krebs is using her current position to stack the odds in her favor.The Dakota Free Press pointed out that Krebs has purged thousands of voters from the rolls in the last threes months.The September 1, 2017, South Dakota voter registration tally shows 11,762 voters 2.14% of the August 1 total removed from Active status and 11,450 newly Inactive voters. This one-month purge restocks the Inactive pool, which the Secretary of State has whittled down over the last 18 months from a March 2016 peak of 54,708 to an August 2017 low of 30,619. Inactives now total 42,069 Thus, in three months, the Secretary of State managed to scrub 3.06% of the names on the voter rolls.Considering how close elections can be in this country, three percent is a big deal and could easily be enough to guarantee a victory for Krebs in November 2018.In fact, Democratic voters were targeted most by Krebs, which makes it all the more clear that she is rigging the election to help herself. In all, 2.63 percent of Democratic voters were purged from the rolls. If Democratic voters are kept from voting, her opponent doesn t stand a chance against her.And that s probably the whole point.This is voter suppression in its ugliest form. No candidate for office should have unfettered access to the voter rolls. As Secretary of State, Krebs is supposed to make sure elections are fair. But because she is going to be a congressional candidate in 2018, it appears she has thrown fairness out the window because winning is more important to her. When she pulls up the list of voters whom the state hasn t heard from for a while, it wouldn t be hard to sort that list by party and start with the Democrats first,  the Dakota Free Press noted.That means Krebs has a conflict of interest and she should be forced to resign.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 5, 2017",0,2116
"Protesters storm Philippines mining event, demand halt to extraction","MANILA (Reuters) - Around 300 protesters clashed with security on Wednesday at a Manila hotel where an annual mining conference was being held, demanding that mineral extraction be halted due to the environmental destruction caused.  The rally comes a day after President Rodrigo Duterte declared he s supporting a ban on open-pit mining in the Southeast Asian nation, a move that could constrict supply from the world s top nickel ore exporter.  Words are not enough, he must act on it,  lawyer Aaron Pedrosa of Sanlakas (One Force), an activist political group that was among the protesters, told reporters.   We are here to express our opposition to mining in our country and the failure of mining companies to rehabilitate mining areas,  Pedrosa said.  Anti-mining protests are a fixture at mining industry events in the Philippines. Some of the protesters, clad in business suits, managed to get past hotel security and into the lobby where they held up placards denouncing mining. Outside the hotel, other protesters, including those from tribal communities, chanted and held streamers saying  Stop Mining Plunder  and  No to Large-Scale Mining . The hotel was locked down for at least an hour.  Mining is a contentious issue in largely underexplored Philippines following past examples of environmental mismanagement. In 1996, for instance, a tailings leak at Canadian-owned Marcopper Mining Corp s copper mine in Marinduque contaminated rivers. The sector contributes less than 1 percent to the economy, with only 3 percent of the 9 million hectares identified by the state as having high mineral reserves being mined, according to government data.  Last month, lawmakers allied with Duterte filed a bill seeking to ban mining in watershed areas and exports of unprocessed ores. The bill would also require miners to get legislative approval before operating. The move comes after a 10-month mining crackdown led by former Environment Secretary Regina Lopez, who ordered the closure or suspension of 26 of the country s 41 mines and banned open-pit mining.  Lopez failed to be confirmed in her post by lawmakers and was replaced in May by Roy Cimatu, a former soldier who has so far not reversed any of her previous measures.  Gerard Brimo, president of top Philippine nickel ore producer Nickel Asia Corp, said the industry would like to show Duterte old mines that have been rehabilitated, including open pits. Open-pit extraction is allowed under a Philippine mining law and is widely used in the country where most ore is near the surface and low grade.  If you want minerals and metals ... that s the reality. That s the case in the Philippines as it is all over the world. But the other reality is that it can be rehabilitated.

Missing Argentine submarine highlights years of military underfunding,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The search for an Argentine submarine missing in the South Atlantic for more than a week has highlighted the dwindling resources and lack of training faced by the armed forces since the end of a military dictatorship in the early 1980s.  As South America s second-largest economy has lurched from one crisis to the next in recent decades, military funding has not been a priority for cash-strapped governments, and an incident like the disappearance of the ARA San Juan was a problem in the making, military and political analysts said.    Human rights violations perpetrated by the dictatorship broke the bond between society and the armed forces,  said Andrei Serbin Pont, research director at the CRIES think tank in Buenos Aires. He said a rethinking of the military s role in society was long overdue.   The majority of Argentines don t really care about the armed forces, therefore politicians aren t particularly interested in maintaining any sort of military policy or defense policy,  he said. Since the loss of the Falklands War to Britain in 1982 and the fall of the dictatorship the following year, military spending has fallen from 2.16 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to a low of 0.87 percent in 2011, according to World Bank data.  While it inched up to 0.96 percent of GDP last year, spending remains well behind neighboring Brazil and Chile, which spent 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent of GDP on their militaries, respectively, the data show. It is too early to determine the cause of the disappearance of the ARA San Juan, and an intense search and rescue effort continued on Wednesday. But Argentina s submarine fleet has been among the areas of the military most plagued by a lack of funds.  In 2014, the fleet spent a total of just 19 hours submerged, versus the 190 days needed  for the fulfillment of operational and training needs,  according to a May 2016 report by specialist publication Jane s Sentinel.   The fact that you had so little use of the submarines was an indication that clearly they were a problem waiting to happen,  said Evan Ellis, a research professor focusing on Latin America at the U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute. President Mauricio Macri pledged to improve the 26,000-strong armed forces  capabilities during his campaign in 2015. His administration s 2016  State of the State  report noted that 70 percent of the Defense Ministry s budget was spent on wages and pensions, rather than investment.  The conditions in which they work are practically impossible. I m talking about all the armed forces,  Elisa Carrio, a key member of Macri s Let s Change coalition, said in a recent television interview.  But since taking office in December 2015, Macri has not markedly improved the financing situation. The 2018 budget calls for a 14 percent increase in funding for the Defense Ministry, below inflation expected at 15.7 percent. In March, then-Defense Minister Julio Martinez told Reuters Argentina lacked money to buy aircraft or replace an aging fleet. The German-built ARA San Juan was launched in 1983 and underwent a local upgrade beginning in 2008 which included the replacement of its four diesel engines and its electric propeller engines, according to Jane s Sentinel. Shortly before giving its last location on Nov. 15, the submarine reported an electrical outage. Concerns about the state of the vessel surfaced when video was published by newspaper Perfil of a tense meeting between Macri and relatives of some of the 44 crew members.  Does someone have to die for things to change? Could you not have invested in this before?  one sailor s wife was recorded telling Macri. Macri said the ship s level of maintenance, not its age, was what mattered, and that authorities were convinced the submarine was in good condition. Argentine news media have reported that the search has sparked friction between the navy and the defense ministry, with civilian authorities concerned that the military has not been forthcoming with information. Navy officials have denied this. A ministry source, who was not authorized to speak publicly,  told Reuters the ministry has opened an investigation into the incident and has not ruled out criminal charges once the search operation is complete.

 Happy 4th Of July! American Income Inequality Hits Historic High,"As people head out to celebrate America s independence, some people have more to celebrate than others. A LOT more.Even as the economy recovers from the financial collapse engineered by the rich, those same people managed to reap almost all the rewards, leaving the rest of us to scramble for the scraps. And while the rich whine about how persecuted they are, a new study shows that income inequality in America is at an all time high with no signs of slowing down.How bad is it? Very:While the past two years have been good for the majority of Americans  income growth, they still haven t fully recovered from the recession. For the bottom 99 percent, incomes fell 11.6 percent during the height of the recession from 2007 to 2009. Afterward, they grew just 7.6 percent between 2009 and 2015   not enough to make up for the downturn. Incomes for the 99 percent have only recovered about 60 percent of what they lost.But the rich are doing great. The incomes of the 1 percent grew 37 percent between 2009 and 2015. They captured more than half of all the income growth in the country over that period, leaving just 48 percent to spread out among the bottom 99 percent of families.The Washington Post writes about a study of income inequality throughout the entirety of America s existence and the two researchers found that today s inequality is the worst it s ever been and steadily getting worse. Even when the country was first founded and most people lived on farms, the rich were not far separated from the poor. In fact, even the  Gilded Age  which saw obscene amounts of wealth concentrated in the hands of the few was not as obscene as it is now. Here s the chart they used:(Excerpted from Unequal Gains: American Growth and Inequality since 1700. Courtesy of Princeton University Press)If you ll notice, the sharp upturn of income inequality started in the 1970s when unions started to dwindle and corporations started to increase worker productivity while refusing to share the profits from it. You ll also notice that the sharpest climb came after the 2008 financial crisis.This hoarding of wealth is what has lead to the 1% attempting to completely co-opt our system of government by buying politicians outright. The bad news is that this is going to get much worse before it gets better. The good news is that the rich always lose these fights in the end. The British lost when they tried to bleed the colonies dry. The southern slave holders lost when they tried to maintain their control over their  property.  The Robber Barons lost when they tried to turn America into their own personal playground. And the current crop of greedy, soulless 1%ers will lose this time as well.Soon-to-be Hillary Clinton may not go after the rich with both barrels blazing, but she, like Obama before her, will lay the foundation for the 99% to take our country back. By quietly rebuilding the government institutions and courts the GOP crippled, we re going to have the tools we need to wrest control away from the corporations and stop the decline of the middle class and the suffering of the poor.So light those fireworks, America! We re almost ready to declare our independence from the 1%!Featured image via Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images",News,"July 4, 2016",0,3307
U.S. aims to trim its U.N. peacekeeping bill after Trump's calls to slash,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States wants to cut $1 billion from the total United Nations peacekeeping budget for the year from July 1 to shave over 10 percent off Washington’s share of the bill following calls by President Donald Trump for U.S. funding to be slashed. The proposal by the largest U.N. contributor is an opening bid in negotiations by the 193-member General Assembly budget committee, which has to agree funding for 13 peacekeeping missions and a logistics support office by the end of June. Reuters reviewed a document compiling the peacekeeping budget proposals by states and regional groups. The U.S. proposal of an annual budget of $6.99 billion was the lowest made - nearly $1 billion less than U.N. chief Antonio Guterres’ proposal and almost $570 million less than the recommendation by the world body’s budget advisory experts. Under the U.S. proposal, Washington would have to pay $1.99 billion compared with $2.25 billion for the current year. While Trump has described U.S. funding for the United Nations as “peanuts” compared to its “important work,” he complains its share of the peacekeeping bill, currently 28.5 percent, is “unfair.” In his 2018 budget proposal he requested Congress approve only $1.2 billion for U.N. peacekeeping.  This is $1 billion less than the U.S. peacekeeping bill for the 12 months to June 30, 2017, when the total peacekeeping budget was $7.9 billion. Washington currently owes $417 million for peacekeeping, U.N. officials said. Ultimately the U.S. Congress sets the federal government budget and will decide how much money is made available for U.N. peacekeeping. Republicans, who control both houses, and Democrats have said they do not support drastic cuts proposed by Trump. Under the U.S. proposal to the U.N. budget committee, the largest cuts would be made to some of the most expensive operations in Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali and Sudan’s Darfur, according to the document seen by Reuters. The 193 U.N. member states are working to negotiate a compromise by the end of the month between the U.S. proposal, at the low end of the scale, and the highest suggestion of $7.72 billion by the African Group, according to the document. Trump also wants to enforce a 25 percent cap on the U.S. contribution to U.N. peacekeeping. The U.N. General Assembly is due to negotiate next year new levels of contributions by countries for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The United States also pays 22 percent of the $5.4 billion U.N. core budget. Guterres has pledged to make U.N. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.

Obama to sign bill to battle heroin addiction,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will sign legislation passed by Congress aimed at combating a nationwide epidemic of heroin and other opioid addictions, the White House said on Wednesday. After months of wrangling, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday, 92-2, to pass the bill that has also been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. The measure aims to help communities develop treatment and overdose programs at a time when fewer than half the estimated 2.2 million Americans who need help for opioid abuse are receiving it, according to the U.S. Centers for Human and Health Services. The White House said in a statement the bill “falls far short” of the necessary funding, but Obama would sign it “because some action is better than none.” Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a leading proponent of the legislation, said that it marked “the first time that we’ve treated addiction like the disease that it is, which will help put an end to the stigma that has surrounded addiction for too long.” While its passage marked a rare bipartisan effort in this election year, Democrats complained that it does not provide  enough resources to effectively address the drug problem. “This bill is like a Hollywood movie set - something that appears real on the surface but has no substance and no life behind its facade,” said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat. U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record high in 2014, propelled by abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 28,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2014. At least half, HHS said, of those deaths involved a prescription opioid. Among the common prescription drugs are oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl that are used for pain treatment. Heroin-related deaths have also increased sharply, more than tripling since 2010. In 2014, more than 10,500 people died from heroin, the agency said. The bill authorizes $181 million a year for new programs it creates. Democrats said that with disagreements in Congress over next year’s funding for HHS, it was uncertain whether the money contained in the bipartisan bill actually would be delivered.  They called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, to back up this legislation with $600 million in immediate emergency funds. Obama has requested $920 million for opioid treatment programs over two years. The bill, if enacted into law, also would provide new training for emergency personnel in administering drugs to reverse opioid overdoses and help communities purchase those drugs.

China says resurfacing tensions on Korean peninsula regrettable,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that after two months of relative calm on the Korean peninsula, the resurfacing of tensions was regrettable.  Wang, speaking to reporters at a joint briefing with his  Mongolian counterpart, said that China has an open attitude on solutions to the North Korean nuclear issue, but that parties should be consultative. In late November, North Korea tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile yet, putting the continental United States within range and increasing pressure on U.S. President Donald Trump to deal with the nuclear-armed nation. North Korea s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country called Trump  insane  on Sunday and said air drills between the United States and the South would  push the already acute situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war .

" Three-Year-Old Dies After Finding Loaded Gun, Shooting Herself (VIDEO)","A three-year-old South Carolina girl died on Saturday, after a days-long battle for her life. According to WACH, the toddler got her hands on a loaded gun, accidentally shooting herself on Monday. On Saturday, the Lexington County Sheriff s Department posted a public tweet, informing the public that the little girl had lost her battle for life.Police say they are conducting an investigation into how the toddler got the gun in the first place. The identity of the family has not yet been made public. At this time no one has been charged in connection with the toddler s death.The toddler s death follows the July 20th shooting death of seven-year-old Thomas William Paisie III. The first-grader accidentally shot himself while handling a loaded gun at the home of his grandfather in Jones County, Georgia. According to The Telegraph, two adults were in the home when the seven-year-old came across the unsecured gun. Neither of the adults was in the room with the child. They heard the sound of a shot and then came in and found the child injured and immediately called 911,  Jones County Sheriff s Officer Kenny Gleaton said.  Unfortunately, the victim had passed away at the scene.  Gleaton went on to say: I would urge people, if they are going to choose to have firearms in their homes, I just encourage them to be responsible and store them safely and separately from ammunition. Keep them under lock and key at all times when not in use. While we hear a lot about  responsible gun owners,  from the NRA, it seems nearly every day in the U.S. we read about a child killed in an accidental shooting. These needless deaths happen because a parent or relative failed to keep a deadly weapon out of the hands of someone too young to understand what can happen.According to the Gun Violence Archive, an organization which tracks shootings across the United States, more than 2,000 children have been injured or killed by guns so far in 2016. Many of these deaths were  accidental shootings,  like those that killed two children this week. No matter what the NRA says, there s nothing responsible about a nation that allows its children to die needlessly, year after year, because some  adult  believes owning a gun is their God-given right. We can do better than this.Here s more on this story from WACH. Featured image via wikipedia cc 2.0",News,"July 24, 2016",0,2415

Democrats aim to turn anti-Trump sentiment into votes in Virginia,"WOODBRIDGE, Va. (Reuters) - Legislative candidate Jennifer Carroll Foy’s first bid for office puts her on the front lines of a Virginia statewide election being watched for early hints on how voters feel about President Donald Trump. Citing Trump’s victory as a tipping point that pushed her to run, the 35-year-old public defender is one of 49 Democrats vying for Republican-held seats in the state’s House of Delegates, up from 29 two years ago. The races will test whether Democrats can convert Virginians’ unfavorable opinion of the Republican president in polls into votes and start clawing back some of the almost 1,000 legislative seats lost nationwide under Democratic President Barack Obama. Foy, long frustrated by her state legislature’s attitude toward women’s rights, is seeking a suburban Washington seat in one of the 17 Republican-controlled districts that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton last year. “Trump was just confirmation that we’re regressing and not progressing,” Foy told Reuters. “Enough is enough. If it’s not me (to run), then who? If it’s not now, then when?” Republicans hold a 66-34 advantage in the lower house of the Virginia legislature. Stephen Farnsworth, a political analyst at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, expects Democrats will make significant gains, especially by focusing on suburban districts. But a takeover of the chamber would require a collapse of Trump supporters, he told Reuters. “A Democratic majority in the House of Delegates is going to require a tidal wave,” Farnsworth said. The national mood has made Virginia Democrats hopeful. Opposition to Trump has galvanized hundreds of thousands of Americans and fueled huge turnouts at street protests since the  New York real estate developer’s January inauguration.  A poll by the Washington Post and George Mason University’s Schar School out May 22 showed 59 percent of Virginia voters disapproved of Trump’s performance, compared with 36 percent who approved. “We’ve got two things going for us in this upcoming election, and that’s going to keep energy high,” said David Toscano, Democratic leader in the Virginia House. “Voting for somebody, and also voting against somebody.” Mark Walter, president of the national Republican State Leadership Committee, said his party was watching Virginia but that it was difficult to tell how voter feelings about Trump would affect the races.  In New Jersey, the only other state holding statewide elections this fall, Democrats already control both chambers. The Virginia Republican Party is unfazed by the surge of challengers. Republicans had $6.5 million for House races by the end of March, compared with the Democrats’ $2.8 million, according to the most recent numbers from the state elections department.     “We’re doing what we’ve always done,” Chairman John Whitbeck said in an interview with Reuters. “Raise a lot of money, knock on a lot of doors and win a lot of seats.”     Toscano, the House Democratic leader, said his party’s candidates would use congressional Republicans’ efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature domestic legacy, as a campaign issue, as well as Trump’s brief hiring freeze for most federal workers. The party also will cite Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe’s legacy of adding thousands of new jobs and billions in capital investment as a selling point, Toscano said.  McAuliffe cannot run again due to term limits, but the edge fellow Democrats have in the race to replace him is expected to give the party’s House hopefuls a boost. Democrats consider the 2nd District, home to sprawling housing subdivisions, strip malls and the Quantico Marine base, one of the party’s best bets to pick up a seat.     Clinton won the district by 21 points in November, helping her win a state that was once reliably Republican in presidential elections. Foy and fellow Democrat Josh King will compete in the June 13 primary. The winner will face Republican Laquan Austion in November for the seat being vacated by the Republican incumbent, who is not seeking re-election. All three candidates say voters are more concerned about local issues, such as traffic jams, education and pollution from power plant coal ash, than Trump. “Obviously, the Trump effect is in the air, but we’re focusing the energy into what we can do locally,” said King, 36, a deputy sheriff who narrowly lost the 2015 election for the seat.

OOPS! Emails Prove Woman Who Accused Trump Of Sexual Assault In The 1990’s Is A Phony…Tried to Get A Job On Trump’s Campaign That Would Require Her To Be Close To Him,"Just a few months before reports of her sexual assault lawsuit against Donald Trump rocked the campaign, cosmetics executive Jill Harth lobbied to be the then-candidate s make-up artist.On Monday, The Hill detailed the story of Harth s repeated efforts to become Trump s campaign makeup artist and to pitch her new male cosmetics product line,  Made Man.  Her solicitations, in both emails and in person, came a few months before her 1997 lawsuit was brought to light, along with several other sexual misconduct allegations against the candidate. The Hill learned of her appeals to Trump in an interview with Harth in December about her friendship with celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom; Trump s lawyers then provided the emails. The Hill followed up with Harth, who defended both her attempts to work with the man she accused of sexual assault and her current call for him to be impeached.In 1997, Harth sued Trump for allegedly pushing her up against a wall and trying to get his hands up her dress during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in 1993. She eventually withdrew the lawsuit as part of a settlement over Trump allegedly pulling out of a business deal. But as The Hill notes, the tone of her emails to Trump in 2015 was  starkly different  than the tone of her 1997 lawsuit and the interviews she gave about it in 2016.The Hill provides some examples of the emails Harth personally sent to Trump between the summer of 2015 and early 2016: Hi Donald, you are doing a tremendous job of shaking things up in the United States. I am definitely on Team Trump as so many others are,  Jill Harth wrote the future president in an Oct. 1, 2015, email sent to him through his New York company s headquarters. I can t watch television without seeing you or hearing your name everywhere! It s a good thing for sure but PLEASE let me do your makeup for a television interview, a debate, a photo session, anything!  Harth wrote. It kills me to see you looking too orange and with white circles under the eyes. I will get your skin looking smoother and even toned,  she added, boasting she would  sculpt your face  to look good on high-definition television sets.The Hill also notes that Harth is one of the accusers who financially benefited from her work with Bloom on the allegations: the attorney set up a GoFundMe page for Harth that paid off her mortgage and an email revealed that Harth s sales soared after Bloom appeared on TV to discuss her allegations.  Daily WireBIG PAYDAYS FOR TRUMP ACCUSERS:According to FOX News, Legal powerhouse Lisa Bloom tried to line up big paydays for women who were willing to accuse President Trump of sexual misconduct during the final months of last year s election, according to an explosive report.Proud to call Attorney @LisaBloom my friend. She is very warm, smart, caring, & REAL. Watch her interview on  The View . You ll see what I mean. She even mentions me. pic.twitter.com/rAW9CvxGYn  Jill Harth (@jillharth) November 11, 2017The Hill reported Friday that Bloom worked with campaign donors and tabloid media outlets to arrange compensation for the alleged victims and a commission for herself, offering to sell their stories. In one case, Bloom reportedly arranged for a donor to pay off one Trump accuser s mortgage and attempted to score a six-figure payment for another woman. The former ultimately declined to come forward after being offered $750,000, the clients told The Hill. ",left-news,"Dec 20, 2017",0,3584
Russian ex-minister Ulyukayev: I am victim of 'monstrous set up',"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Former Russian economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev, accused of taking a $2 million bribe from Rosneft chief executive Igor Sechin, told a court on Thursday he was the victim of  a monstrous and cruel provocation.  State prosecutors said the bribe was given last year on Nov. 14 in exchange for Ulyukayev approving the sale of state-controlled oil company Bashneft to Rosneft. Ulyukayev denies the charges. He says he thought the bag holding the bribe was a gift of expensive alcohol.  A monstrous and cruel provocation was carried out against me,  Ulyukayev told the court in his final statement before it hands down a verdict on Dec. 15.  This trial has aroused public interest similar to that of  a circus,  he added.  The charges are absurd, the evidence is absurd, and at its base lies the cruelty and impunity of the provocateur.  Rosneft head Sechin, a witness in the trial and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has not appeared in court, citing work commitments. Russian prosecutors earlier this month sought a sentence of 10 years in jail for Ulyukayev. ",worldnews,"December 7, 2017 ",1,1151

 Trump Supporter Caught In Racist Meltdown While Waiting For Coffee (VIDEO),"It s been more than a week since the election of Donald Trump and his supporters have been teaching us a big lesson   namely that they re really bad winners and that their sense of entitlement to nearly everything just escalated because their orange candidate won a few more swing states.At a Starbucks near the University of Miami, a man who thought his coffee was taking just a little too long went on a racist rant that shows exactly the type of attitude of entitlement that Trump supporters are sporting now. Fortunately, it was all caught on video by another Starbucks customer, Jorge de C rdenas.The Starbucks was crowded, as many are at any given point during any given day. The white Trump (complete with Trump-like hair and a tall, leggy blonde companion who would surely win the approval of the President Elect) voter, though, thought he deserved to get his coffee faster than the others, and if he didn t, it had to be because Starbucks employees, some of whom happen to have dark skin, hate white people.The man was, by his standards, anyway, waiting too long in line, so he started screaming  Trump!  at an African-American employee. Then he claimed that there was  anti-white discrimination  and that s why he was waiting.He said it was  anti-white discrimination,'  C rdenas says,  so he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said,  Fuck you, bitch.  That s when I started filming.

Russia's Medvedev says the world shouldn't be dominated by one currency,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Russia and China were considering linking their national payment system, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday, as he called for a more balanced global finance structure. Noting the rise of China s Unionpay system and Beijing s efforts to internationalize its currency, the yuan, Medvedev told a press conference in Beijing that Russia was developing its own payment system, known as Karta Mir.  At the present moment it is being discussed whether Karta Mir should be linked to Chinese payment systems,  he said, while standing alongside Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. That would have  good prospects  and  avoid those problems that sometimes arise when you use American payment systems , Medvedev said, mentioning Visa and Mastercard without elaborating. Russia started to create the Karta Mir system after Western sanctions were imposed on the country in 2014, during the Ukraine crisis. The system is now widely accepted in Russia. After new U.S. sanctions were imposed, Moscow promised to intensify work to cut dependence on Western payment systems further. Among other things, it wants to create more domestic financial services such as its own ratings agency.  I think that the more financial instruments there are in the modern world, the more stable the global financial system will be,  Medvedev said. Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to clients of one Russian bank after Washington imposed sanctions over Moscow s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and support of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Around 14 million Mir cards, which translates as  World  or  Peace , have been issued in Russia, according to the Russian National System of Payment Cards (NSPK), or about 10 percent of the country s population.  NSPK was established in 2014 and is 100 percent owned by the central bank. More than 380 banks working in Russia accept the cards, which are issued by 120 banks. Practically all trade and service points, including cafes, shops, restaurants and petrol stations, accept them.  Mir cards are also welcome in sanctions-hit Crimea where Western banks are banned from operating. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",1,2224

NFL DENIES Dallas Cowboys’ Request To Honor Slain Police Officers…IGNORES NFL Player Who Posted Pic Of Cop’s Neck Being Slit On Social Media,"The NFL was able to take a stand when it comes to the Cowboys attempt to honoring slain police officers in their hometown, but when an NFL player posts an  ISIS type execution of a police officer on social media, they can t seem to find their voice to express their disapproval The NFL has denied the Dallas Cowboys  request to wear the  Arm-in-Arm  decal on their helmets for Saturday s preseason opener against the Los Angeles Rams.The Cowboys had unveiled the decal at an emotional start to their first padded practice of training camp, when they walked arm-in-arm on the field with Dallas police officials, including police chief David Brown, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings and the families of the police officers slain in the line of duty last month.The Cowboys, who wear the decal on their helmets during training camp, knew they would not be able to wear the decal for the regular season but had hoped to wear it in the preseason. We certainly understand the position the league takes on this, but it won t diminish our support for that concept of unity and supporting our police force and what they do to make our lives better on a daily basis,  coach Jason Garrett said.  That arm-in-arm image is something that we really believe in. You heard me talk about it a couple weeks back. What we re trying to do as a football team is build a team that s close. We talk a lot about unity and having each other s backs, and certainly they embody that. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has this to say about the decal controversy:Tight end Jason Witten spearheaded the idea of the players honoring the police and the families. While a little disappointed, Witten believes the gesture at the start of camp can have a long-lasting impact. What s really important is what we tried to do, and that s to unite that community, our community, and show that support for those families and really honor the leadership of our city,  Witten said.  I think that decal not being on the helmet is not going to stop that. It s going to continue to do that not only now but in the future as we move forward. As players and an organization that is something we re going to continue to support.    ESPNWe reported about Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell s Instagram post on July 11, 2016.

The running back deleted the post and the Browns demanded he publicly apologize, which he did.But Stephen Loomis, President of Cleveland Police Patrolmen s Association, thinks the  store-bought apology  isn t enough.  He needs to go to Dallas, help the families who lost their loved ones last week, write them a check, look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology. Loomis says Crowell s post was as  offensive as putting a picture of historical African-American men being hung from a tree in the 60s.  He adds that if Crowell doesn t go to Dallas and make a donation,  I will pull Cleveland officers, sheriffs, state troopers out of First Energy Stadium this season if he doesn t make it right. As for Crowell admitting he was wrong and acted out of rage   Loomis says,  You re a grown ass man, and you claim you were too emotional to know it was wrong? Think we ll accept your apology? Kiss my ass.    TMZ ",left-news,"Aug 11, 2016",0,4105
"Russia says close to Syria deal with Turkey, Iran","ASTANA (Reuters) - Russia, Turkey and Iran are close to finalizing an agreement on creating four de-escalation zones in Syria, a senior Russian negotiator said on Thursday. The three sides are discussing details of the agreement at meetings in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, Alexander Lavrentyev, who leads the Russian delegation, told reporters.  Our main task at this international meeting on Syria is to finalize and establish four de-escalation zones,  Lavrentyev said.  We are very close to reaching an agreement on creating these four zones.  The meetings, which also involve representatives of the Damascus government and some rebel factions, will continue on Friday. Lavrentyev said the agreement was likely to include provisions on the deployment of monitors - such as military police servicemen - in the four zones and, more specifically, on their borders. The previous round of Syrian peace talks in Astana in July ended with no agreement after Turkey raised objections. Russia and Iran, which back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s government, and Turkey, which supports some of the rebels, have been holding talks in Kazakhstan since January and the meeting this week is their sixth.

"BLACK LAWYER, Editor Of Legal Website Writes: Black Jurors Should Automatically Vote To Free Any Black Person Accused Of Murdering, Committing Crime Against A White Person Regardless Of Evidence","Elie Mystal, an editor and contributor to the law blog Above The Law, posted a December 7 article urging all black Americans who end up on juries to engage in  jury nullification  by automatically voting to acquit all blacks accused of crimes, especially that of murder, against white victims and to do so no matter how much evidence is brought to bear against the suspect.Mystal justified this lawlessness by claiming that  African-Americans live in a world where the police can murder us and get away with it. There is no justice for black people. And yet violently revolting against the system will get us nowhere,  he added.This, Mystal says, is reason enough to work against the legal system in all areas.

"REPORT: ANTI-TRUMP, Open-Borders Clooney’s No Longer Feel Secure In England…Moving Back To U.S","Actor and immigration activist George Clooney will move to Los Angeles with his wife Amal and newborn twins Ella and Alexander due to security concerns at his England estate, according to a report.Life & Style magazine reported last week that the 56-year-old Oscar-winner will move his newly-expanded family to his mansion in Studio City, California, after deeming his 17th century mansion in Sonning, England to be not sufficiently safe for them. As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement,  an unnamed Clooney  insider  told the magazine.  His mansion in Studio City [Calif.] was deemed the most secure, and it s within minutes of an LAPD station. He doesn t feel like Amal and the twins are safe living in the English countryside,  the source told Life & Style.  He s determined to move his family to LA, where he feels much more secure. The report comes as England has been rocked by terrorist attacks in recent months, including the terrorist bombing of a concert by pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in June that claimed the lives of 22 people, many of them young children.In May, British government officials disclosed that 23,000 known jihadi terrorists are believed to be residing in Britain, far more than the 3,000 that had initially been reported.The move for the Clooneys comes as both George and Amal have been among the most vocal and active celebrity advocates for open borders and the free flow of refugees between countries.In February of last year, the actor met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and praised the German leader s acceptance of refugees from Syria and other countries. The same month, Clooney told Sky News in an interview that the United States is not doing  enough  to help Syrian refugees, and that 10,000 refugees per year was too low a figure to be admitting into the country.In an April 2016 interview with the BBC, Amal Clooney criticized then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s plans to build a security wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, telling the outlet that the plan does not represent  U.S. values. George has also been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling The Guardian in a March 2016 interview that he believes Trump to be a  xenophobic fascist  and an  opportunist.  He previously described Trump s immigration policy proposals as  idiotic  and  intolerant.   Breitbart In July, 2016, it was reported that the Clooney s were considering moving from their mansion in Italy after a massive makeshift refugee camp was established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

 Bizarre Late Night Statement Proves Deputy AG Is Just Another Water Carrier For Trump,"Donald Trump s administration and White House is the leakiest in living memory. This is because even his own staff knows that he is incompetent, intemperate, childish, narcissistic, and completely unfit for the office he holds. Despite the fact that they all know this, the sycophants around him just keep on doing his bidding   and they keep leaking. These leaks seem to be worrying Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   or rather, likely Trump s open rage with regards to them has forced Rosenstein s hand.Instead of defending the integrity of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as Trump and his minions have spent the last few days attacking this decorated public servant, Rosenstein instead decided to issue a bizarre statement late Thursday night that shows that he, too, is now shilling for Trump. The statement attacks the credibility of anonymous sources, saying:Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous  officials,  particularly when they do not identify the country   let alone the branch of agency of government   with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations. The Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations.Fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pointed out that Rosenstein should be defending Special Counsel Mueller instead of shilling for Trump:Where is Rod Rosenstein's overdue statement responding to the President's repeated attacks on his appointment of Robert Mueller? pic.twitter.com/y7dwtWTQ4G  Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) June 16, 2017This is beyond strange. The Department of Justice is not supposed to be politicized, but still the people therein serve at the pleasure of the president. More than likely, Trump ordered Rosenstein to do this, since so many damning stories about the Russia investigation are coming out on an almost hourly basis. Trump is reportedly completely obsessed with the Russia story, and still hasn t let go of the idea of somehow getting rid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In fact, the only reason Mueller is still there is because White House aides talked Trump off the ledge when he was about to order his firing.Conservative commentator Bill Kristol has an excellent theory as to what is going on with Rosenstein s behavior, and it s terrible for the nation:The Rosenstein statement suggests there must be a heck of a Trump story coming based on alleged information from anonymous foreign officials  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 16, 2017In the Age of Trump, the independence of the Department of Justice is definitely shot, and this proves it. While it was clear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a part of Trump s campaign and one of his staunchest supporters was nothing but a Trump shill, we had all hoped that Sessions  recusal from the Russia investigation and Rosenstein s taking over would give the whole situation a bit more credibility, but no.All I can say is thank goodness for Robert Mueller. Hopefully, firing him would be a bridge too far   even for Congressional Republicans.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",0,3270
" Trump Convention Delegate Just Indicted On Serious Federal Charges, Including Child Abuse","The Trump presidential campaign has already faced a rocky road to the nomination, including the now-defused threat of a contested convention, as well as widespread rejection of the nominee from the party elite (he has had the support of the rank-and-file).Now a stomach-turning criminal charge has surfaced.A Donald Trump delegate headed to the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland has instead been indicted on serious charges.A Donald Trump delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention has been indicted in Maryland on federal charges that include using a minor to make child pornography, illegal possession of a machine gun and illegal transport of explosives.Caleb Andrew Bailey, 30, from Waldorf, Maryland, was indicted late Wednesday, according to a release from the Department of Justice.Bailey was listed on the Maryland Secretary of State website as an elected Trump delegate to the party meeting.The Justice Department said he allegedly tried to send ammunition and weapons through the mail to someone in Wisconsin. When they searched his home they found a machine gun. In the indictment that came down, the Department said Bailey  attempted to use and did use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct to produce child pornography. Previously, the Trump campaign had enlisted the support of a white supremacist as a delegate in California. William Johnson is the head of the white nationalist American Freedom Party and financed pro-Trump robocalls during the primaries.While the Trump campaign first claimed they had enlisted Johnson s support due to a  database error,  they had to rely on him to voluntarily step down since the deadline had already passed for him to be withdrawn.The Huffington Post reported that the Trump campaign had not responded to them about the allegations against Bailey in Maryland, and it was unclear what they would do about his status as a Trump representative at the convention.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 19, 2016",0,2060

BREAKING: HILLARY CAUGHT MOCKING Bernie Sanders Supporters In Leaked Audio…Donors Laugh [Audio],"We all know by now that Hillary Clinton will morph into whatever she needs to be to win votes to get back to the White House. Here s EXHIBIT 1 on just how far she ll go While speaking to a group of donors last February, Hillary mocked Bernie Sanders supporters and admitted the  free college  and  free healthcare are just a ploy to win the votes of millennials The Intercept had this to say about Clinton s flip flopping:Clinton has been inconsistent in the past about espousing political labels. She has at times touted herself as stalwart liberal. For instance, she said last July:  I take a backseat to no one when you look at my record in standing up and fighting for progressive values.  But a few months later, she told a group in Ohio:  You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty. AUDIO OF CLINTON MOCKING BERNIE SUPPORTERSCLINTON: Some are new to politics completely. They re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents  basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don t see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said,  You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance.  So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you re feeling like you re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn t pay a lot, and doesn t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic. We want them to set big goals. But to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals.",politics,"Sep 30, 2016",0,2162
"Bulgarian, Macedonian Orthodox Churches edge closer despite thorny history","SOFIA (Reuters) - The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has taken a step towards possible eventual recognition of Macedonia s Orthodox Church, a rapprochement that echoes a warming of relations between the governments of the two Balkan neighbors. However, the move is unlikely to be welcomed by other Orthodox Churches such as those of Serbia and Greece, in a region where religious identity is often closely tied up with nationalist passions and politics. The Macedonian Orthodox Church was formed when the country was part of communist Yugoslavia but has never been recognized by other Orthodox churches due to a long-standing dispute over its independence from the Serbian Orthodox Church, with which it was previously formally united. This month, however, the Macedonian Church sent an official request to Bulgaria s 1,100-year-old Orthodox Church asking it to become its symbolic  mother  church. Bulgaria has close linguistic, cultural and historic ties with Macedonia. In a statement on Monday the Bulgarian Orthodox Church said that  aware of its sacred duty... (it was) taking all necessary steps to establish the canonical status of the Macedonian Church .  We must accept the outstretched hand of Macedonia,  Bulgaria s Orthodox Patriarch Neofit said.  This is the least (we can do) because they are our brothers.  The move comes three months after the prime ministers of Bulgaria and Macedonia signed a friendship treaty in a move designed to end years of diplomatic wrangling and boost Macedonia s European integration. The Bulgarian Church s Holy Synod, its top executive body, will consult with other Eastern Orthodox churches, including those of Russia and Greece and Serbia, before announcing its final decision, it said. The Eastern Orthodox Church is the second largest Christian denomination worldwide with more than 250 million members, but unlike the Roman Catholic Church it has no supreme leader comparable to the Pope but instead is composed mainly of de facto national churches, each led by a patriarch. There was no immediate response on Monday from the Orthodox Church in Serbia, Greece or elsewhere to the Bulgarian move, but they are unlikely to be positive. Greece is locked in a long-running dispute with Macedonia over the country s name, which is also the name of a northern Greek province, and Athens has blocked the Skopje government s attempts to join the European Union and NATO. Russia s Orthodox Church, by far the biggest worldwide, is unlikely to do anything that might compromise Moscow s strong ties with Serbia. Moscow is also opposed to Macedonia s plans to join NATO and the EU. But Bulgaria s Orthodox Church could unilaterally recognize Macedonia s Church, a move sure to cheer Bulgarian nationalists.  The Bulgarian Church must recognize the Macedonian (Church),  Bulgarian Defence Minister Krasimir Karakachanov, co-leader of the United Patriots party, a junior partner in the centre-right coalition government in Sofia, said on Monday.  The two brotherly churches speak without a translator and use the same church books,  he added, alluding to the close linguistic links.  Bulgarian nationalists regard the Macedonian language as a dialect of Bulgarian. ",worldnews,"November 27, 2017 ",1,3273

 Ivanka Trump’s Rabbi Decides Not Speak At RNC For A Very Good Reason,"With the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio just days away, presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump s list of speakers just got shorter. Many Republicans are opting out of attending the event with the exception of an underwear model, Gov. Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie and Ben Carson. And now, Ivanka Trump s Rabbi has decided not to attend.Politico obtained an email from Rabbi Haskel Lookstein to his congregation in which he explained after a backlash that he accepted an invitation from Trump s daughter to deliver the convocation in Cleveland  out of respect for her and our relationship. But that s all changed now and he explained to his congregation why he had a change of heart.Politico reports: Unfortunately, when my name appeared on a list of speakers at the convention, without the context of the invocation I had been invited to present, the whole matter turned from rabbinic to political, something which was never intended,  wrote Lookstein, who also served as the principal of the prominent Orthodox Jewish school Ramaz.But there may be more to it than that   like the backlash that ensued when it was revealed that Lookstein was to speak at the convention.Earlier on Friday, the Jerusalem Post reported that 600 Ramaz alumni had written Lookstein a letter, condemning his decision to speak at the convention.  This is the single action history will remember you by, and history will not be kind,  it read.Lookstein noted in the email the prayer he intended to deliver at the convention, which reads, in part: We thank you for our constitutional government that has created and fostered the American ideals of democracy, freedom, justice and equality for all, regardless of race, religion or national origin. Almighty God: We know that we are living in very dangerous times, when all of these blessings are threatened from without, by forces of terror and unimaginable brutality, and from within, by those who sow the seeds of bigotry, hatred and violence, putting our lives and our way of life at risk. He was seriously going to say that at the divisive GOP candidate s convention. With Ted Cruz, Huckabee and Trump in the room, he was going to speak against bigotry? Wow. That would have gone as well as Ted Nugent speaking at the Democratic Convention. That is, if we even believe the Rabbi s excuse. The letter penned by 600 Ramaz alumni likely had something to do with Lookstein s decision.The Donald is having a very bad day. Tim Tebow released a video in which he strongly denies a story circulated by Trump s presidential campaign that he will be a speaker at the Republican Convention. Many GOP leaders as well as rising stars in the party are opting out of speaking at the event. However, Trump does have his family members penciled in to offer praise for the hotel magnate.

EPA head seeks to avoid settlements with green groups,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a directive to his agency on Monday seeking to end the practice of settling lawsuits with environmental groups behind closed doors, saying the groups have had too much influence on regulation. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who sued the agency he now runs more than a dozen times in his former job as attorney general of oil producing Oklahoma, has long railed against the so-called practice of “sue and settle.” The EPA under former President Barack Obama quietly settled lawsuits from environmental groups with little input from regulated entities, such as power plants, and state governments, he argues.  The directive seeks to make EPA more transparent about lawsuits by reaching out to states and industry that could be affected by settlements, forbidding the practice of entering into settlements that exceed the authority of courts, and excluding attorney’s fees and litigation costs when settling with groups.  Most lawsuits by green groups on the agency seek to push the agency to speed up regulation on issues such as climate and air and water pollution, studies have shown.  “The days of regulation through litigation are over,” Pruitt said. “We will no longer go behind closed doors and use consent decrees and settlement agreements to resolve lawsuits filed against the agency.” Pruitt’s order was supported by conservative groups. Daren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said sue and settle has led to “egregious antics” that have “effectively handed over the setting of agency priorities to environmental pressure groups,” and has led to rushed rulemaking by the agency.    But Pat Parenteau, an environmental law professor at the Vermont Law School, said Pruitt’s directive would be “counterproductive” and costly because in the end courts could fine the agency if it does not meet compliance dates for issuing regulations. “He can fight it if he wants as long as he wants, and spend as much money as he wants,” Parenteau said. “But in the end if you’ve missed a statutory deadline, you are going to be ordered (by a court) to comply and then you are going to be ordered to pay fees.”  ",politicsNews,"October 16, 2017 ",1,2292
 Learn The FACTS About What The FBI Is Saying Concerning Hillary’s Emails; Trump LYING (DETAILS),"The media everywhere seems to be jumping on the new revelation of Hillary Clinton s emails without actually reading what was written by FBI Director James Comey.While Donald Trump, alongside pretty much every mainstream media branch, is saying that the FBI is  reopening  the investigation, that s not at all what was written.Comey, doing his due diligence and informing Congress that new emails had been discovered, sent the following letter: In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. Note the word  supplement. He continued: In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that they FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to out investigation. In other words, they are looking at them to determine if they should include them in the previous investigation. Which is solidified with this next point: Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. In other words, Comey is being completely transparent as the emails are looked at, but he never said the investigation is being reopened. Rather, the additional emails that were found are being assessed to see if they need to be subject to further scrutiny.In addition:BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server.

GREED! It s simply greed and thinking they are above the law. The elitists like the Clintons need to be taken down because they put Americans last and their own greed first.

U.S. approves license for Ukraine to buy small arms from U.S. firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved an export license for Ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from U.S. manufacturers, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Wednesday. Department records show Ukraine has bought small amounts of those types of weapons for several years, both before and after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukraine s Crimean peninsula. The department notified Congress of the decision on Dec. 13, Nauert said, adding that the U.S. government was not selling the weapons directly to the Kiev government but was allowing Ukraine to buy from U.S. manufacturers.   Under the previous two administrations, the U.S. government has approved export licenses to Ukraine, so this is nothing new,  Nauert said. The license covers weapons in categories such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms up to, and including, .50 caliber weapons. It also includes combat shotguns, silencers, military scopes, and flash suppressors, as well as parts. Nauert said the U.S. government had not directly provided lethal defensive equipment to Ukraine, nor had it ruled out doing so. U.S. exporters can apply for direct commercial sales licenses at any time and those are reviewed by the State Department on a case-by-case basis, she said. ",worldnews,"December 21, 2017 ",1,1339
Trump says 'only one thing will work' with North Korea,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said “only one thing will work” in dealing with North Korea after previous administrations had talked to Pyongyang without results. “Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid,” Trump said in a tweet. “...Hasn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, making fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!” Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind. The president has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang’s nuclear threats. Earlier this week, during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the “calm before the storm.” Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said: “You’ll find out.” Speaking to reporters on Saturday ahead of a trip to North Carolina, Trump said he had nothing more to clarify. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders referred to Iran and North Korea the following day when asked about Trump’s “calm before the storm” comments. Asked on Saturday about Trump’s tweet, Sanders said she had nothing to add to the president’s comments. The Pentagon referred a question for clarification to the White House and said the Defense Department’s job was to “present the president military options and carry out orders.” Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government. Trump said on Saturday that he had a good relationship with his secretary of state despite some disagreements. “We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes I’d like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that we have a very good relationship,” he said. A Russian lawmaker on Friday was quoted saying North Korea was preparing to test a long-range missile that it believes can reach the west coast of the United States. Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, was part of a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang from Oct. 2-6, according to Russian RIA news agency. North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs have driven up tensions in the region and around the world in recent months, particularly after it conducted a test explosion of what it said was a hydrogen bomb.

Trump wins Scottish golf course privacy rights case,"LONDON (Reuters) - A grandmother who had sued a luxury Scottish golf resort founded by U.S. President Donald Trump for breaching her privacy by photographing her urinating on the course, lost her case on Wednesday. Rohan Beyts, a long-term opponent of the Trump International Golf Links (TIGL) on the northeastern coast of Scotland, had sought 3,000 pounds ($3,745) in damages at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court over the incident last year which she said had left her shocked and upset. She claimed that by filming her, staff had breached data protection laws. Beyts, 62, who said she had a bladder condition at the time, told the court she had tried to hide from sight after urgently needing to go to the toilet while walking on the course. Four days later she was visited by police who charged her for public urination, media reports said. At the time, the club was not registered under UK data protection laws and staff had used photographs taken of Beyts on their mobile phones as part of a police complaint against her which was later dropped, British media reports said. While Sheriff Donald Corke ruled she should not have been filmed, he said any distress was not a result of the company’s failure to register under the data Protection Act. TIGL said in a statement Beyts had come onto the course looking for trouble and the case was “nothing more than a poor attempt at self-publicity in an effort to garner support for her anti-Trump, anti-business propaganda”.   “Rohan Beyts is a shameless activist with a history of antagonistic behavior,” it added. “Members of our green-keeping staff were flabbergasted at what they witnessed and reported the incident to the police. It should have come as no surprise to her that she was charged for publicly urinating on golf course land.” Beyts told reporters after the ruling: “It was never about the compensation. I wasn’t interested in money. “I was only interested in clearing my name when the Trump Organization representative spoke of me committing a deliberate and shameful act within a few feet of the clubhouse in full view of staff and guests. That was not the case.”  ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2017 ",1,2177
TRIGGERED? POLICE OFFICER Kicked Out Of Event For Wearing Uniform,"The city s first transgender police officer was kept out of an event at the San Diego LGBT Community Center because she was wearing her uniform.The Transgender Day of Awareness, an annual event to honor those who lost their lives to anti-transgender violence, was held Nov. 17 in the Hillcrest neighborhood. Officer Christine Garcia, who transitioned last year, helped plan the event and was part of the Police Department security detail that watched over a commemorative march down University Avenue. After the march, when Garcia tried to enter the event as a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, she was asked to leave because her uniform could upset others in attendance. When leaders at the center learned what had happened, they apologized to Garcia and San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman.  We do not wish to ever make any community member feel unwelcome   these officers are valued members of our community,  Delores Jacobs, chief executive officer of the LGBT center, said in a statement. Jacobs said the occurrence was a misunderstanding of the center s existing policy of inclusion, which seeks to acknowledge the concerns that members of the community may have without excluding others. Leaders have reviewed the policy with its staff since the event.  While we need to support those that are uncomfortable and honor their reactions to valid and understandable difficult previous experiences, we also need to explain that  our LGBTQ San Diego police liaisons are a valued part of our community,  Jacobs wrote. Longtime LGBTQ activist, City Commissioner Nicole Murray-Ramirez, said the incident was an outrage.  Any officer, be they gay or straight, should be welcomed into our community center in uniform,  he said.  They protect our community and neighborhoods and make San Diego a better place.Read more: San Diego Tribune",left-news,"Nov 24, 2016",0,1939
 WATCH: CNN Host RIPS Kellyanne Conway A New One For Not Taking Russian Hack Seriously,"Kellyanne Conway is not taking Russian interference in our political process seriously, so CNN host Kate Bolduan called her out for it.During an interview on Thursday night, Bolduan asked Conway about Donald Trump s reaction to President Obama slapping sanctioned against Russia, including the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, in retaliation for hacking the DNC and meddling in the election on Trump s behalf.Trump insisted that we move on and blamed computers instead of the Russians for the attack because  computers have complicated our lives greatly. Conway, as usual, brushed off the question and began whining about the New York Times and Hillary Clinton all while once again claiming that Trump won a huge victory. She also accused President Obama of hitting the Russians with sanctions as a political maneuver against Trump.Let s not forget that Clinton won the popular vote and Trump electoral win is one of the smallest margins of victory in the last 100 years.But while President Obama s actions against Russia may make it harder for Trump to kiss Putin s ass, it s hardly politically motivated. The CIA and 17 other intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered in our election, and there needed to be consequences because Trump sure as hell was not going to do anything about it himself.Conway, however, continued her obsession with talking about Hillary Clinton to dodge Bolduan s questions and whined about people questioning Trump s legitimacy, which forced Bolduan to call Conway out for not taking the Russian hacking seriously. This is serious,  Bolduan said.  This is about a foreign country hacking into the United States electoral process. Regardless, it doesn t even have to do with the result, even. It is more that they tried to and did. Conway replied by blaming the DNC for the hack instead of the Russians who did the hacking and then proceeded to accuse the intelligence community of trying to interfere with the election results.Here s the video via YouTube:It sure sounds like there will be a lot of friction between Trump s team and the intelligence community, and frankly, they should tell Trump he s on his own.

WATCH: LITTLE HOUSE ON PRAIRIE ACTRESS Runs For Congress…Thinks It’s Okay For Grown Men To Rape 13 Year Old Girls (If Mom’s Home),"America has proven time and time again that liberals in Hollywood can say just about anything. The vile comments actress Melissa Gilbert made about child rape while hosting The View sound more like something a member of ISIS would make, than someone who is running for Congress. It s interesting how the oh-so-easily-offended Left is never offended when one of their own makes a highly controversial comment, but  if the same remarks were made by a conservative, they would be on a 24/7 news loop. Melissa Gilbert, the actress who brought Laura Ingalls Wilder to life in  Little House on the Prairie,  made some comments on a TV show in 2009 that are coming back to haunt her.And they should. Gilbert moved to Michigan from California and is running for Congress in the 8th District, challenging Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Rochester.But running for office opens the door to past skeletons.As a guest host of  The View  seven years ago, Gilbert and the other hosts discussed the arrest of famous movie director and producer Roman Polanski in Switzerland for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl three decades earlier. Polanski had pleaded guilty of assaulting Samantha Geimer in 1977, but fled the U.S. before he was sentenced.Hollywood is loyal to its own, and on the show, Gilbert downplayed Polanski s crime, saying that  it s gray area when momma is in the building,  in reference to reports that Geimer s mother was at the house when the rape occurred.Gilbert went on to say that  the punishment at this point may be excessive.

U.S. House may consider bill to fund government for a week: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representative could move soon to consider a bill to fund the government for a week to avoid a shutdown at midnight on Friday and buy time to strike a deal for a long-term funding plan, a House Republican source said on Wednesday. A one-week bill would give lawmakers “a little breathing room” to complete negotiations on broader legislation, the source said. Democrats have said they would support a weeklong extension only if a deal on a longer-term plan was close to completion, and a senior House Republican suggested that was the case. “We could get there today, we are not very far away,” Representative Tom Cole, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters.

 Meet The Woman Who Took Down Evangelical Pedophile Josh Duggar,"By now, everyone is aware of what took down the Duggar family, of TLC s 19 Kids and Counting fame. It was the explosive revelations that one of the most famous members of the reality television family, Josh, was a pedophile. He had molested his own sisters, as well as other girls in the house. It led to the cancelling of the show, and to the family leaving public life in disgrace. However, no one ever knew who was responsible for it   but now we do.A woman by the name of Sherri Townsend is the one who tipped off InTouch Magazine to the true and sick nature of what was going on in the Duggar clan. They weren t just some weird family who were part of a right-wing religious cult and exploiting their insane beliefs for piles of cash. No   they were a family of child abusers, and Townsend set out to prove it. Prove it she did, and there was the end of the Duggars  reality show goldmine and public promotion of their sick religious cult.Townsend says, via Facebook, of what she did: I m going confess/admit to y all something that I did a couple of years ago that not very many people know was me.I told a reporter from InTouch magazine about Josh Duggar s molestation/pedophilia of his sisters and others, which broke the story and ultimately caused his resignation as the head of the Family Research Council and got his family s hypocrisy-filled show cancelled. Townsend goes on to say that it was a special on so-called  conversion therapy  pushed by anti-LGBTQ religious nuts like the Duggars that got her to reveal who she is: Sitting here sick to my stomach from watching last night s 20/20 expose on conversion therapy camps, I can see that hateful religious bigotry is still alive and well and that the dangerous hate group, the Family Research Council, has doubled down on promoting their brand of bigotry causing terrible harm to countless people. THEY NEED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN. That group is true evil!!! Bringing them down will now be added to my list of causes!!! Good on Sherri Townsend. At the height of his fame, Josh Duggar was working for the anti-gay hate group the Family Research Council, and he and his family were the ultimate right-wing paragons of hate and so-called Christianity. Now, they are pariahs and a national disgrace, as they always should have been.Sherri Townsend, you are one brave woman. Thank you for exposing this hypocrisy, abuse of children, and religious cultism for what it is, and taking these despicable people down.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 15, 2017",0,2558
"Trump backs Middle East peace, even if not tied to two-state solution","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump supports the goal of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, even if it does not involve the two-state solution, a senior White House official said on Tuesday. Speaking a day before Trump holds a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the official said peace was the ultimate goal.  “Whether that comes in the form of a two–state solution if that’s what the parties want, or something else,” the official said, adding that Trump would not try to “dictate” a solution. Failure by a U.S. president to explicitly back a two-state solution would upend decades of U.S. policy embraced by Republican and Democratic administrations. It has long been the bedrock U.S. position for resolving the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has been at the core of international peace efforts. Any sign of a softening of U.S. support for eventual Palestinian statehood could also anger the Muslim world, including Sunni Arab allies, which the Trump administration needs in the fight against Islamic State and to back efforts against Shi’ite Iran. Trump considers Middle East peace a “high priority,” the White House official said. The president has given his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the job of negotiating a peace deal. “We would want to work on it very quickly,” the official said. Trump’s choice for U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, will not be involved in the president’s discussions with Netanyahu on Wednesday, the official said. Friedman advocates settlement building and has questioned the two-state solution.  The White House said earlier this month that Israel’s building of new settlements or expansion of existing ones in occupied territories may not be helpful in achieving peace. The statement was a shift in tone for Trump, who signaled during the campaign that he could be more accommodating toward settlement projects than his predecessor, Barack Obama.

 Obama Just Threw MAJOR Shade At Trump During Last National Security Speech (VIDEO),"During President Obama s final National Security speech as president, he took a moment to let President-Elect Trump know that it s imperative citizens are able to criticize authority without fearing they ll get in trouble.It was clearly a remark aimed at Trump because of the president-elect s inability to be able to take criticism and will often lash out in some way shape or form against whoever dare to speak up against him or have a different opinion.President Obama said: freedom can never be taken for granted. Each of us has a responsibility to sustain it. The universal right to speak your mind   protest against authority. To live in a society that s open and free. That can criticize a president without retribution. If Trump actually wants to be president, he s going to have to learn how to handle criticism, and he s going to have to learn fast. He s not only going to get criticized by both sides of the aisle, but by the public at large and the rest of the world. He needs to be able to handle that and not do anything to threaten our national security nor the freedom of American citizens to speak their mind.President Obama has been one of our most criticized national leaders in a long time, and he, more than most, knows that you must keep a level head, and he clearly wants Trump to learn how to do that too.Watch President Obama throw major shade at Trump here:Obama says the US is a country where citizens have a right to  protest against authority  and criticize a  president without retribution  pic.twitter.com/8XQAw0BdAt  Brianna Sacks (@bri_sacks) December 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"December 6, 2016",0,1714

Supreme Court allows broad Trump refugee ban,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump to broadly implement a ban on refugees entering the country from around the world. The justices granted a request from the Trump administration to block a federal appeals court decision that, according to the Justice Department, would have allowed up to 24,000 additional refugees to enter the United States than would otherwise have been eligible. The Supreme Court ruling gives Trump a partial victory as the high court prepares for a key October hearing on the constitutionality of Trump’s controversial executive order, which banned travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and limited refugee admissions.  The March 6 order suspended travel for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the Republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks and allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures. The order took effect in late June, following a Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings.  In a ruling last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents would be exempt from the travel ban. The Justice Department opted not to appeal that part of the 9th Circuit decision. However, the 9th Circuit also ruled that Trump’s refugee policy was too broad, and the court allowed entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency.  The Justice Department appealed, and the full Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with the administration in a one-sentence order. Naureen Shah, Amnesty International USA’s senior director of campaigns, said the refugee ban is inherently cruel. “The Supreme Court today has dealt yet another devastating blow to vulnerable people who were on the cusp of obtaining safety for themselves and their families,” she said. “They continue to be subjected to unimaginable violence and fear while their lives are in limbo.” Earlier on Tuesday the state of Hawaii, which challenged the policy, said in a court filing that the U.S. government could still “bar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country.” All the 9th Circuit ruling did is “protect vulnerable refugees and the American entities that have been eagerly preparing to welcome them to our shores,” Hawaii’s lawyers added. Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said he respected the Supreme Court’s decision and is preparing for the hearing there on Oct. 10.  ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2017 ",1,2655
Trump stars and spars with Republican lawmakers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump endured some blunt exchanges when he met Republican members of Congress on Thursday but several lawmakers, including past critics, emerged with encouraging words about their presumptive White House nominee. Republican aides cited good attendance from both houses of Congress at the two closed-door meetings, even though some lawmakers made a point of staying away, citing previous commitments. The New York businessman-turned-politician has sought in speeches and meetings in recent weeks to unite the party behind his unorthodox candidacy and to reassure Republican leaders about his conservative credentials. In a Miami speech on Friday, Trump will say the economic policies of Democrats like President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the party’s presumptive nominee, have harmed minorities, said Steve Moore, a Trump economic policy adviser.   Trump drew 41 of 54 Republican senators to the U.S. Senate meeting where he called out three senators who had been critical of his candidacy, according to Republican aides familiar with the meeting. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the meetings with lawmakers were positive and productive, adding characterizations of discord “attributed to unnamed sources, are wholly inaccurate.”   Trump also met privately with Senator Ted Cruz, his former rival for the Republican nomination. They did not discuss an endorsement but Cruz did accept Trump’s invitation to speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland the week of July 18, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. At the first session on Thursday, with members of the House of Representatives, Trump shared a hug with House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has often criticized Trump even while endorsing him, lawmakers said. They joked a bit about some of their past exchanges during an hour-long session, and Trump took questions. “I’m going to make you proud,” Representative Bill Flores quoted Trump as saying. Trump won grassroots support during months of state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election with a pledge to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. He regularly annoys party leaders with inflammatory remarks. Flores, a Texan who heads the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative grouping in Congress, had criticized Trump, including for having questioned a U.S. judge’s motives because of his Mexican ethnicity. Flores had said he wanted to see “more vision and less trash talk” from the presumptive nominee. After Thursday’s session, Flores said he felt better about Trump. “Based on what I have heard today, I’ve got the confidence that you are going to see a lot more in terms of visionary messaging,” Flores said. “Today was extremely positive,” said New York Republican Peter King, another representative who has criticized Trump. “There was not one negative moment.” But not everyone was won over. “I need to be persuaded,” said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who said he would not support either Trump or  Clinton. Trump’s session with Republican senators sounded more turbulent. The Washington Post reported details of a combative exchange between Trump and Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has expressed concern that Trump’s comments on immigration will cause Hispanic voters in the state to reject him. When Flake stood up and introduced himself, Trump told him, “You’ve been very critical of me,” the Post said. “Yes, I’m the other senator from Arizona — the one who didn’t get captured — and I want to talk to you about statements like that,” Flake responded, referring to Trump’s past dismissal of Senator John McCain’s record as a prisoner during the Vietnam war. The senator urged Trump to stop attacking Mexicans; Trump predicted that Flake would lose his re-election, at which point Flake informed Trump that Flake was not up for re-election this year. Flake’s spokesman Jason Samuels said the Post account was accurate. Trump also turned to Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has refused to endorse him, and “said something along the lines of ‘Surely you don’t want Clinton,’” one Republican aide said of the session. Trump said he would win also in Illinois, the home state of a third Republican critic, Senator Mark Kirk, who is in a tight re-election race and recently withdrew his endorsement of Trump. “He’s wrong,” Kirk told reporters several hours later. “I think Trump is going to get a vote like Alan Keyes got, which is about 28 percent,” Kirk said, referring to the Republican who ran unsuccessfully for senator against Obama in Illinois in 2004.   Trump’s Twitter posting as he left Washington showed no sign of discord. “Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!” he tweeted. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 ",1,4894
GRASSLEY DEMANDS ANSWERS ON TRUMP JR SETUP: Russian Lawyer Tied to DNC Firm…Who Allowed Russian Lawyer Into US After Denied Visa Entry? [Video],"Republican Senator Charles Grassley wants answers on why the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. was allowed in the US after her visa had been denied. Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on  Fox & Friends  that she  magically appeared  in the US. Grassley has written to the Secretary of State and DHS Secretary in an effort to get to the bottom of this mystery.The second curious connection is that the DNC opposition research firm, Fusion GPS, is connected to the Russian Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Remember that Fusion GPS is responsible for the Trump-Russia Dossier that made scurrilous claims against President Trump including the  golden showers  incident:Circa News Reports: Fusion has been a major focal point of the FBI and Congress because it hired a former British intelligence agent named Christopher Steele to produce a salacious intelligence dossier that made wild and still unsubstantiated claims about Trump ties to Russia.Does anyone else find it curious that this woman claimed to have dirt on Clinton but never produced a thing. Was she told to just say that to get Donald Jr. to meet with her in a set up? Her Facebook profile shows anti-Trump leanings so why would someone anti-Trump want to deliver information to Donald Trump Jr?

"LEFTIST FOR A LIVING Changes Position, Turns On Obama, Declares: “This Is A War…Shut Down The Borders…No Visas” [VIDEO]","FLASHBACK: Watch the video below to see Kudlow mock Republicans for their strong defense of closing our borders in his interview with  Gang of Eight  member, Jeff Flake (R-AZ) two years ago. The president had his last chance last Sunday night. And he didn t do it. He is not a wartime commander in chief. In fact, he is not a commander in chief. A hardline shift from an immigration reformer.I know this is not my usual position. But this is a war. Therefore I have come to believe there should be no immigration or visa waivers until the U.S. adopts a completely new system to stop radical Islamic terrorists from entering the country. A wartime lockdown. And a big change in my thinking.ISIS and related Islamic terrorists are already here. More are coming. We must stop them.Until FBI director James Comey gives us the green light, I say seal the borders.Here s what we must do: Completely reform the vetting process for immigrants and foreign visitors. Change the screening process. Come up with a new visa-application review process. Stop this nonsense of marriage-visa fraud. And in the meantime, seal the borders. I agree with Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, who argued many of these points in excellent detail on the National Review website on Friday.Again, why am I taking this hardline position? In the past, I have been an immigration reformer, not a restrictionist. But we are at war. That changes everything.Watch Kudlow demean conservative position on border control and immigration reform to RINO, Rep. Jeff Flake (R-AZ):Let me emphasize that my support for wartime immigration restrictions is not based on religion. I think Donald Trump made a big mistake here. Instead, I agree with this Rupert Murdoch tweet:  Complete refugee pause to fix vetting makes sense. Fortunately, the Republican House voted to tighten restrictions on travel to the U.S. by citizens of 38 nations who presently enter our country without a visa. This covers 20 million visitors a year who are allowed to stay 90 days. And of course this system is abused, big time.But I say seal the borders. People hoping to relocate to the U.S. from Syria, Iraq, and anywhere in the Middle East, and people coming here from France, England, Sweden, and wherever will be upset, at least for a while. There may be some unfairness to this. But I don t care. Wars breed unfairness, just as they breed collateral damage.We may set back tourism. We may anger Saudi princes whose kids are in American schools. But so be it. We need a wartime footing if we are going to protect the American homeland.Of course, President Obama doesn t get it. He never will. Already we should have led NATO into a declaration of war against ISIS. Already we should have pushed a resolution of war against ISIS through the UN Security Council. Already we should have convened meetings with our Mideast allies to formally declare war against ISIS. Already the U.S. Congress should have issued a formal declaration of war against ISIS.The president had his last chance last Sunday night. And he didn t do it. He is not a wartime commander in chief. In fact, he is not a commander in chief.As I have written before, if the U.S. wants to destroy ISIS, it can destroy ISIS. We won t end terrorism around the world. But we can destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Prominent generals are telling us that. Prominent national security strategists are telling us that.So let s do it.If there is to be a true wartime effort to destroy ISIS, our leaders must communicate a sense of urgency and energy. Define the clear goal: the destruction of ISIS. Speak to that goal constantly. Take steps at home and abroad to back up that goal. Lead the country. Rally the country.Republican and Democratic commanders in chief have done this in the past. We must do it again.I don t believe a visa or immigration lockdown here in the U.S. will solve the Islamic terrorist threat. Many other steps must be taken. And I am not suggesting this in the name of religious profiling. Instead, I am hardening my position on immigration because we are at war and I fear we may be losing this war.My shift in thinking comes from a deep desire to strengthen homeland security. Hopefully an immigration freeze will not be in place for very long. But for now I believe we must do it. (By the way, keeping America safe is a prerequisite for growth.)And let me add, as I have in the past, if the U.S. has the will, the urgency, and the energy to destroy ISIS, then we will destroy ISIS.WATCH Kudlow s defense of immigration in this video only one year ago.

Syrian opposition aims for Assad's removal in Geneva talks,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The Syrian opposition delegation at peace talks in Geneva is aiming for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad and plans to engage his negotiators in serious and direct talks, the head of the opposition delegation Nasr Hariri said on Monday. Hariri called for major powers, especially Russia, to pressure the Assad government into real negotiations on a political transition followed by a new constitution and free elections, in line with a U.N. roadmap to end the six-year war.  We stress that political transition which achieves the ousting of Assad at the beginning is our goal,  Hariri told a news conference after arriving in Geneva for a round of U.N.-led talks that is scheduled to start on Tuesday.   Our goal in the negotiation will be the departure of Bashar al-Assad from the beginning of the transition,  he said. A breakthrough in U.N.-backed Syria peace talks in Geneva this week seems hardly more likely than in seven failed earlier rounds as Assad pushes for total military victory and his opponents stick by their demand he leave power. All previous diplomatic initiatives have swiftly collapsed over the opposition demand that Assad must go and his refusal to do so. The Syrian government delegation, led by its U.N. ambassador and chief negotiator Bashar al-Ja afari, failed to arrive in Geneva on Monday when it had been due. It was not clear whether the delegation would arrive on Tuesday, when U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura is due to meet the opposition.  We don t have high hopes, the regime is using delaying tactics to obstruct progress toward a political solution, at a time when the opposition comes with one unified delegation,  Hariri said.  Russia .. .is the only entity capable of bringing the regime to the table of negotiations.  For many years, Western and Arab countries backed the opposition demand that Assad leave office. However, since Russia joined the war on behalf of Assad s government two years ago it has become increasingly clear that Assad s opponents have no path to victory on the battlefield. The Syrian civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused the world s worst refugee crisis, driving 11 million from their homes. The Syrian government continued its bombing and sieges of areas including 400,000 people in eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held Damascus suburb, Hariri said on Monday.  We are here for the hundreds of thousands who under siege who are in grave need of humanitarian aid and for hundreds of thousands of detainees who are at the verge of death, suffering but living death every day,  he said.

U.S. embassy to Russia to resume some visa services after diplomatic row,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy to Russia said on Monday it would restart some visa services in U.S. consulates which it had previously canceled due to diplomatic expulsions that had left it short-staffed. The United States began to scale back its visa services in Russia in August, drawing an angry reaction from Moscow three weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered Washington to more than halve its embassy and consular staff. The U.S. step meant Russian citizens wanting to visit the United States for business, tourism or educational reasons were  no longer able to apply via U.S. consulates outside Moscow and had to travel to the Russian capital instead. The embassy said in a statement on Monday some visa services would resume on Dec. 11. “On December 11, the U.S. consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and Vladivostok will begin to offer limited interviews for non-immigrant visas,” it said.

UK's Boris Johnson reignites leadership speculation with Brexit plans,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson set out his plans for a  glorious  Brexit on Saturday that angered colleagues and reignited speculation he would challenge Prime Minister Theresa May for the leadership of the Conservative party.  With May due to set out her vision for Brexit in a speech in the Italian city of Florence on Friday, Johnson published a 4,300-word newspaper article that roamed well beyond his ministerial brief and, in some cases, went beyond the approach set out by the government.  Britain, he said, would not pay to access European markets in the future. Once out of the European Union, the country should borrow to invest in infrastructure, reform the tax code and set immigration levels as it sees fit.  A prominent Brexit campaigner in last year s referendum, Johnson also repeated the controversial claim that the government would be 350 million pounds ($476 million) better off per week once outside the EU.   My friends, I must report that there are at least some people who are woefully underestimating this country,  Johnson wrote in the Daily Telegraph.  They think Brexit isn t going to happen.   I am here to tell you that this country will succeed in our new national enterprise, and will succeed mightily.   We have a glorious future.  With some colleagues angered by the timing - Johnson s article was published a day after a bomb injured 30 people on a train - he later added on Twitter:  Looking forward to PM s Florence Speech. All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit . A favorite with grassroots members of the Conservative Party, Johnson had been expected to challenge for the leadership after May gambled away her parliamentary majority in a June election she did not need to call.  Instead, he publicly pledged his loyalty. But the Times newspaper reported earlier this week that Johnson believed he had since been sidelined as May prepares to compromise over a divorce bill with the EU to ease the negotiations.   We would not expect to pay for access to their markets any more than they would expect to pay for access to ours,  he wrote. The article made no reference to a transition period the government is expected to negotiate.  And yes   once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly 350 million pounds per week,  he said.  It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS (health service).   During the campaign, Johnson traveled around Britain on a bus emblazoned with a slogan suggesting that Britain was sending 350 million pounds a week to the EU - a figure rejected as inaccurate by experts - and that the money would be better spent on the NHS.  Saturday s article also included Johnson s belief that Britain needed to leave the EU because  so many young people with the 12 stars lipsticked on their face  were beginning to have split allegiances between Europe and their own country. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Saturday s comments also laid bare the conflicts within May s government and cut the ground from beneath the prime minister s authority. But a source within Downing Street said Johnson s views were well known.  As you ll see in the PM s speech next week the government is united in our determination to make the most of the opportunities for a successful future outside the EU.  Colleagues criticized the timing of the article, which came around two hours after May put Britain on the highest threat level of critical, meaning an attack may be imminent.   On the day of a terror attack where Britons were maimed, just hours after the threat level is raised, our only thoughts should be on service,  said Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Conservatives in Scotland.  Will Tanner, a former adviser to May, said the timing was astonishing, self-serving and disloyal.  The real PM *just* raised threat level. Meanwhile guy who wants to replace her issues a prelude to resignation, to save face over 350 million pounds. Hmm.  ",worldnews,"September 16, 2017 ",1,4080
Trump lawyers make final Supreme Court pitch on travel ban,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday made its final plea to the U.S. Supreme Court to allow its proposed ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries to go into effect as the justices weigh how to handle the hotly contested dispute. The court papers filed by President Donald Trump’s administration complete the briefing on the government’s emergency application asking the justices to block lower court injunctions in favor of challengers to the ban. The Supreme Court could now act at any time. The lower court rulings blocked the 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States to give the government time to implement stronger vetting procedures. In the court papers, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall said the lower courts had wrongly second-guessed the president on national security policy when reviewing the March 6 executive order. “The president expressly determined that the order’s provisions are needed to promote national security, but the lower courts here ... nullified that judgment,” he wrote. In court papers filed on Tuesday, lawyers for the state of Hawaii and individual plaintiffs in Maryland urged the high court not to allow the ban go into effect.

WHY IS AL SHARPTON’S “Half-Brother” Registering Thousands Of Felons To Vote In Alabama’s Controversial Senate Race? [VIDEO],"Pastor Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow claims he s Reverend Al Sharpton s brother, and he s registering thousands of felons to vote in the hotly contested, upcoming Senate election. When the local News 5 station looked into the pastor s claim, that he was Al Sharpton s brother, they made an interesting discovery.  Glasgow told News 5 that he was indeed Al Sharpton s brother and that he dropped the  Sharpton  because  we didn t want somebody that s a racist, a bigot, to try to kill me knowing I was Sharpton s brother  while he was in prison. News 5  performed a background check on Glasgow and came up with nothing.  They also called Reverend Sharpton s office in New York and spoke with Sharpton s media correspondent, who said he d never heard of Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow. It wasn t until they contacted Sharpton-Glasgow s mother, Tina Glasgow, that they finally discovered the connection.As it turns out, Glasgow actually has ties to Al Sharpton Watch the video below for the bizarre details:Much like his brother, the  pastor  is also a Democrat activist, and he is pulling out all the stops to help the party defeat Judge Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama. While the Democrat Party is begging for donors to help support Moore s opponent, Doug Jones, Al Sharpton s half-brother is busy signing up felons to vote in a controversial election, where every vote will count.Thousands of felons across Alabama have registered to vote in recent weeks, according to Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, who is heading up a statewide effort to get felons to the voting booth.Glasgow s goal is to get as many felons as possible signed up to vote before the end of the day Monday, the deadline to be able to cast a ballot in Alabama s Dec. 12 U.S. Senate special election. In the last month, I think we registered at least five- to ten-thousand people all over the state,  Glasgow, president of Dothan s The Ordinary People Society (TOPS) advocacy group, said Monday.  I ve got people all over the state registering people with my TOPS branches in Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, Montgomery, Enterprise, Dothan, Abbeville, Geneva, Gordon, Bessemer, we have a lot. For generations, most Alabamians convicted of a felony were barred from ever voting in the state again, but the Definition of Moral Turpitude Act, a new law passed by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in May, cleared the way for thousands of felons to restore their voting rights.The law lists several dozen felony convictions that are considered crimes  of moral turpitude,  which means that anyone convicted of one of them loses the right to vote; other felons are now eligible to restore that right. Previously, the list of crimes that some registrars considered to be  of moral turpitude  was not clearly defined, and many felons simply believed they could never regain the franchise.

NAFTA talks must include discussion on fintech: Mexican negotiator,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) must include a discussion of new financial services, a Mexican negotiator said on Wednesday, singling out so-called fintech companies rapidly gaining ground in the region.  Created 23 years ago, NAFTA includes Canada, Mexico and the United States and is being renegotiated at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump who made a campaign promise to get a better deal for U.S. workers.  Vanessa Rubio, an undersecretary at Mexico’s finance ministry who is taking part in the NAFTA negotiations that began in Washington on Wednesday, said discussions on financial services had found common ground between the three countries. “We are not yet sure what will end up in the text of the new agreement, but we are sure that we need to have a discussion about new services, above all about the fintech industry,” Rubio told Reuters in an interview. Rubio said her U.S. counterparts were focused on transparency in new regulations, while she pushed the need to standardize rules. To modernize the deal, the three sides are looking at how to include e-commerce and other technological developments that did not exist when NAFTA was first negotiated.

"Flynn could prove to be key asset in Mueller's U.S. campaign probe, sources say","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for former national security adviser Michael Flynn have halted communications with U.S. President Donald Trump’s legal team, a potentially critical step in the probe into contacts between Trump’s election campaign and Russia, sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, called John Dowd, Trump’s private lawyer, on Wednesday to say the matter had reached a point where the two could no longer could discuss it, two people familiar with the call told Reuters on Friday. The New York Times first reported that the two sets of lawyers had stopped communicating.  Flynn, a retired Army general, is a central figure in a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian efforts to boost his 2016 presidential campaign. It was not clear whether Kelner made the call because he had negotiated a plea agreement with Mueller for Flynn to cooperate in the probe, or because Flynn had decided to engage with Mueller, said two other sources. “No one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president,” Jay Sekulow, another attorney for Trump, said on Thursday.     Dowd on Friday declined to comment on the matter, as did Peter Carr, Mueller’s spokesman. Kelner also declined to comment. White House officials also have declined to comment. The cooperation of Flynn, who was a top campaign adviser before becoming Trump’s national security adviser in the White House, would be a major asset in Mueller’s investigation. In March, as he unsuccessfully sought immunity for his client to testify to House and Senate investigations into the issue, Kelner said, “Mr. Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he certainly wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.”  Two sources familiar with Mueller’s investigation said Flynn may be able to provide insight into three major areas of inquiry. These are: any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 campaign; money laundering and other possible financial crimes by Trump aides; and whether Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey in May, as Comey was probing the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia. Russia has denied interfering in the election. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia by his campaign and has called the inquiry a witch hunt. Two congressional officials involved in separate probes into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia said one key area of investigation is whether Flynn or other advisers to Trump ever suggested U.S. economic sanctions on Russia could be lifted in exchange for favorable business deals. Possible deals include a proposed commercial nuclear power project involving Russian firms that Flynn in recent years worked to promote to potential clients in the Middle East, sources familiar with the project told Reuters. “At this point, there is no evidence of an effort to negotiate that kind of deal, but Flynn is near the top of the list of people who probably would know if there was any such effort,” said one of the congressional officials, also speaking on the condition of anonymity. Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13, after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with then Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, the month before Trump took office, and later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Flynn has acknowledged contacts with Kislyak dating back to 2013, but beyond saying they covered a variety of subjects has said nothing about the content of their conversations during Trump’s campaign and after his election. Flynn has been under scrutiny by the special counsel in a number of areas, sources familiar with the investigation have said. Mueller has been investigating whether Flynn knowingly made false statements to the government about his foreign travels, income, and contacts on his security clearance form. Flynn also has come under scrutiny for work on behalf of Russian clients, and over whether his work for a businessman with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was lawful.  Mueller has been investigating Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn, Jr.’s, involvement in some of his father’s business dealings in Russia, Turkey, and elsewhere, the sources said, and that could provide a potent additional incentive for Flynn to cooperate. Barry Coburn, a lawyer for Flynn’s son, declined to comment. ",politicsNews,"November 24, 2017 ",1,4605
Indonesian 'Trump' says has no plans to run for president,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesian business tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo said on Tuesday he was not planning to stand in the country s 2019 presidential election, and that he would support current President Joko Widodo if he chose to run again. Tanoesoedibjo, a business partner of Donald Trump whose political ambitions have led to similarities with the U.S. President being drawn, said in January he would decide before the end of next year whether to run in the ballot.  He previously stood as a candidate for vice president in the 2014 election and subsequently founded his own political party, which will contest Indonesia s general elections in 2019.    Looking at the constellation today, I think President Jokowi will run again and I am in the position to support him,  he told Reuters at the Asia TV Forum and Market in Singapore. Asked if he would stand, he replied:  No, I don t think so.  Widodo is expected to stand for a second term against Prabowo Subianto, who also rang against him in 2014. Religious and political tension in Indonesia, which has the world s largest Muslim population, escalated to its highest level during a divisive election for Jakarta governor earlier this year. Tanoesoedibjo said the political climate in Indonesia remained stable but that the country needed a president that  stands in the middle of everyone .   He (Widodo) is the strongest candidate. He is very moderate and he is very nationalist,  added Tanoesoedibjo. As a business partner of Trump, Tanoesoedibjo believes his relationship with the U.S. President could help ties between the nations and he is not worried about the impact U.S. trade protectionism may have on the Southeast Asia s biggest economy.  At least Mr Trump knows Indonesia better because of the relationship we have between our group and the Trump organization,  he said.  But what he is doing about reviewing the trade relationship with other countries I think is right....but Indonesia is too small...for the U.S. in terms of the amount of trade between the two countries and I don t think that would have any impact at all.  Tanoesoedibjo is Trump s business partner in two resort developments in Indonesia - on the island of Bali and in West Java. Turning to his other business interests Tanoesoedibjo said he had plans to list a division of his company - MNC Studios International - on the Jakarta stock exchange next year.  We have seen many interests (by investors) because it s the largest production company in the country,  he said. ",worldnews,"November 28, 2017 ",1,2567
" Fox News Responds To Trump’s Hissy Fit Over Megyn Kelly, And He’s Not Going To Like It","If there s one thing about Donald Trump that pretty much everyone knows by now, it s that he s never wrong. Well, at least according to Donald Trump. He ll never admit a mistake, he ll double down on controversial statements, and heaven forbid he s asked a question he doesn t want to answer, or even worse, challenged on an answer on live television. The latter is exactly what Megyn Kelly did in the first GOP debate, and oh boy, has that thrown Trump into full tantrum mode, especially finding out she ll be moderating the next GOP debate to be held on Fox News. He literally told CNN s Wolf Blitzer: I mean, I don t like her. She doesn t treat me fairly.

They basically called Trump out for being terrified of Megyn Kelly. If he s terrified during a debate because he s asked questions he doesn t completely fancy, how is he going to deal with leaders around the globe who would inevitably call him out all the time for the decisions he would make as Commander-in-Chief?Fox also told Mediaite is a statement that was pure gold: We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings. Fox News had the perfect response to Trump s hissy fit over Megyn Kelly moderating the next debate.

German SPD backs talks with Merkel after impassioned Europe speech,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Social Democrats (SPD) voted on Thursday to hold talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives on forming a government after their leader made an impassioned plea for a free hand to work for a social  United States of Europe . The vote clears the way for talks that could resolve the impasse into which Europe s economic powerhouse was plunged after Merkel and the SPD shed support in a September election, greatly complicating the parliamentary arithmetic. Martin Schulz urged reluctant center-left SPD members to be open to Merkel s overtures to renew the coalition that has governed for the past four years, saying the party had a responsibility to revive social democracy in Germany. A new  grand coalition  with the reluctant SPD is Merkel s best hope of extending her 12 years in power after talks with two smaller parties failed, giving the smaller SPD greater leverage in any negotiations.  The question isn t grand coalition or no grand coalition,  he said in a speech to his party s biennial congress,  Nor minority government or fresh elections. No - it s about how we exercise our responsibility, including to the next generation.  Schulz said the party would only recover if it could offer a clear vision of a Germany and a Europe that worked for their citizens, calling for deeper European integration and a  United States of Europe  by 2025.  Europe does not always work for its people, rather too often for the big companies,  he said, outlining a populist vision that goes well beyond Merkel s own openness to limited structural reforms and bureaucratic streamlining. Talks between the two parties are expected to begin in earnest in the new year. A special congress will have to be convened at which party members will vote on whether to support a final agreement, which could fall short of a formal coalition, and could include tolerating a minority government. Stephan Weil, the influential premier of the state of Lower Saxony, said the SPD would want to see its policies reflected in return for supporting any government.  I think the majority of the delegates see themselves as a European party and they expect that Germany becomes a driving force in Europe again,  he said of Schulz s proposals regarding the European Union. Schulz s proposals were received more cautiously by Merkel.  The (EU s) ability to act should be at the forefront now,  she said at a Berlin press conference.  So I will concentrate on more cooperation in defense by 2025 and on other issues,  including employment and innovation. Outside the congress hall, SPD youth activists, many of whom want the party to chart a distinctive course after spending eight of the past 12 years in centrist coalitions, handed out red cards reading  No Grand Coalition .  Merkel leads this country without direction,  said one speaker addressing the conference.  She has no plan for Europe, she leads the country from week to week. We need a strong social democracy in this country.  Schulz, who initially said his party should go into opposition after being punished for participating in the previous grand coalition under Merkel, apologized for his party s disastrous electoral result. Schulz attacked European moves to support big banks while doing little to counter high youth unemployment.  When states can t balance their budgets they face draconian sanctions from Brussels. If we can mobilize billions for bank rescues but have to fight for paltry sums to support jobs for young people, then this is definitely not my Europe.  He struck a tone that was more critical of big companies than French President Emmanuel Macron, who is pushing for deeper euro zone integration and pro-business reforms under a euro zone finance minister.  He took aim at U.S. technology firms Apple, Facebook and Google, saying a strong Europe was needed to make them stick to the rules and protect the rights of workers in a changing economy.  We don t want an app-directed service society but we want digitalization to lead to more individual freedom,  he said to applause, calling for steps to protect the digital economy s self-employed from becoming  self-exploiters . On the issue of immigration, one of the main reasons for the collapse of Merkel s first attempt at a coalition, the SPD opposes a conservative plan to extend a ban on the right to family reunions for some accepted asylum seekers.  There can be no upper limit to the right to protection from war and persecution,  Schulz told delegates, rejecting conservative demands for a ceiling of 200,000 immigrants a year.

Kuczynski is also eyeing Claudia Cooper as his new finance minister, one of the sources said. A third source also confirmed Cooper, currently deputy economy minister, was being considered. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because a final decision had not been made. Early on Friday, the opposition-ruled Congress voted 77-22 to dismiss Kuczynski s Cabinet in a motion of no-confidence, deepening a political standoff that could lead to new legislative elections if lawmakers reject the next cabinet. The crisis forced Kuczynski to cancel his trip to New York City, where he planned to dine with U.S. President Donald Trump and deliver a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. It also threatens to stifle a nascent economic recovery in the world s No.2 copper producer following a sharp slowdown early this year. Accusing the opposition of undermining his policies, especially on education, Kuczynski told Peruvians in a televised speech that he would keep working to better their lives.  That s the mandate I have until July 28, 2021 and I won t retreat one millimeter in that goal,  said Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker who narrowly won last year s election. Kuczynski did not announce any cabinet appointments. While he cannot rename outgoing Prime Minister Fernando Zavala as prime minister, Kuczynski can reappoint other cabinet members. Zavala, who faced criticism that he was too much of a technocrat, has doubled as finance minister since Congress ousted the previous finance minister in June. Lawmakers with the opposition party Popular Force warned Kuczynski not to fill his cabinet with old faces. The rightwing populist party has a majority in Congress and is led by Kuczynski s defeated electoral rival, Keiko Fujimori, the eldest daughter of jailed former autocratic president Alberto Fujimori.        Appointing Vizcarra, a former governor of a mining region, could gratify lawmakers who have called for a cabinet with more political experience. But it might also anger Popular Force after the party pressured Vizcarra to resign as transportation minister over a proposed change to an airport contract. Cooper was also criticized by the opposition in the controversy. New legislative elections might provide an opening for anti-establishment parties with support for Kuczynski s government and Congress falling in opinion polls. Despite the sparring, Kuczynski and Fujimori both support free-market economic policies. Central Bank President Julio Velarde made a rare plea for politicians to refrain from fuelling tensions further.  I hope that doesn t happen. We re talking about adults, aren t we?  Velarde told reporters at an event Friday. ",worldnews,"September 15, 2017 ",1,3018
Texas 'bathroom bill' dies in special legislative session,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas measures criticized as being discriminatory for limiting transgender people’s access to bathrooms in schools and public buildings died on Tuesday, as the House adjourned and ended its special legislative session. Business leaders and civil rights groups had battled to defeat the bills, saying they advanced bigotry, would tarnish the state’s image and damage its economy. The measures were blocked by moderate House Republicans.  Adoption by Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could have fed momentum in other socially conservative states on the issue, a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. “Finally, Texans can breathe a temporary sigh of relief,” said JoDee Winterhof, an official of the Human Rights Campaign that lobbied against the bills. “Texans don’t want harmful, anti-transgender legislation,” Winterhof, the campaign’s senior vice president for policy and political affairs, said in a statement. Momentum for so-called bathroom bills stalled this year when  North Carolina partially repealed a similar law in March. The original law prompted boycotts by athletic bodies and businesses that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Texas could have lost about $5.6 billion through 2026 if it had enacted such a measure, said the Texas Association of Business, the state’s leading employer grouping. The House wound up its duties without taking action on any of the bills and adjourned “sine die,” a day ahead of the official end of the 30-day special session. House Speaker Joe Straus, a pro-business Republican who controls the agenda in the chamber, said the issue was not a priority. Straus’ position was reinforced by a well-financed campaign by major corporations, including Texas-based energy companies Halliburton and ExxonMobil Global Services, which have said the bills would make it hard for them to recruit top talent. The measure that advanced the farthest was Senate Bill 3, which passed easily on a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and then died in the House. It would have required people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. Supporters, including Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a staunch social conservative, say the proposed curbs promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children.

 This Really Happened: Fox Interrupted Trump To Criticize Him And Praised Obama,"If today on Fox News was any indication at all, Donald Trump may have finally gone too far, even for some of his base, when he tweeted this Thursday morning about Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski:I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don t watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017 to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year s Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017While his spokespeople have been working overtime defending the indefensible and sexist tweets, even Fox News thought it was over the top and even Fox News is beginning to see how much better we had it under President Obama.Scarborough and Brzezinski s network, MSNBC, along with CNN, was airing live remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a White House press briefing, but Fox uncharacteristically broke away to talk instead about the tweets with Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel:McDaniel defended the president, arguing that his tweets were a natural response to the constant criticism he receives from Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough. Today, the president acted like a human, and he pushed back,  she said.Fox News anchor Julie Banderas wasn t buying the excuse. Listen,  she replied,  you don t need to stoop to the level, obviously. I don t care who you are. You don t stoop to the level of that. I mean that s like me scolding my 4-year-old for using a bad word and then me repeating it. That s just not how you run a country or you parent a 4-year-old. I mean I have to be honest, you know, if you see this negative commentary on a show, change the channel. Ignore it. I mean that s what I tell my kids: When somebody s mean to you, don t fight back. Just walk away. Source: Washington PostThat s not even the best part, Banderas, who s hardly a token liberal (just yesterday she blamed Democrats for the fact that Republicans can t pass Obamacare repeal), went on to compliment President Obama. People used to call President Obama stupid,  she said.  People used to call him a Muslim. People used to call him underqualified, a sellout to America, a hater of Israel. I mean they called him every name in the book, but you didn t see him lash out. No, you didn t. As Trump keeps embarrassing the Republican Party, you re going to see a lot more people distancing themselves.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 29, 2017",0,2621
MADELINE ALBRIGHT: There’s A Special Place In Hell For Women Who Don’t Support Hillary Clinton [VIDEO],"Shaming people into voting for someone now that s what I call desperation. How about we let young women decide for themselves who they vote for without being told they ll go to hell if they don t follow in lockstep with the demands of the left. Note to Hillary and Ms. Albright: Women can think for themselves these days.Former Sec. of State Madeleine Albright attempted to shame young women voters at a Hillary Clinton campaign event on Saturday, repeating her now-famous line:  There s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other. Albright joined New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at a rally in Concord, N.H., just days before the nation s first presidential primary of the 2016 campaign.The 78-year-old diplomat, who served in the Bill Clinton White House, complained that some young women  don t understand the importance of why young women have to support Hillary Clinton. The story is not over, they re going to want to push us back. Appointments to the Supreme Court make all the difference,  Albright said of Republicans, adding that young women  have to help  and that  Hillary Clinton will be there for you. Just remember: there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other,  Albright said, much to the joy of Clinton, who is seen laughing at the remark, which she has used numerous times in the past.

" The Real, Damning Reason Trump Opened Fire On Blumenthal Via Twitter (DETAILS)","By now you ve seen Donald Trump s absolute Monday meltdown on Twitter, a ten-hour tweeting frenzy that beat every other tirade he s ever had on the social media platform. Trump was cooped up indoors because he really wanted to golf, while still claiming it wasn t a vacation, so he was forced to stay at his New Jersey golf club   and he was rained off the course.But scrambled in with the rest of his nonsense were four tweets about Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Four out of thirteen total. That means at least a third of the Orange Babyman s fury was directed at one guy. What could have gotten Trump mad enough for this?Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017 conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017And did you notice the time gap there? Eight and a half hours passed after the initial spate of Blumenthal tweets, and Trump was still fuming about him.It turns out Trump has more to be upset with Blumenthal over than his supposed lies about Vietnam, and it wasn t just his appearance earlier in the day on CNN s New Day, where he discussed the ongoing investigation into Trump s collusion with Russia.According to a Jeffrey Toobin article in the New Yorker from June 20th, Senator Blumenthal is the Democrat most likely to succeed in having his case against Trump heard regarding violations of the  emoluments clause  of the Constitution. From the article:Other lawsuits against Trump, on emoluments grounds, have been filed, including one by the governments of Maryland and the District of Columbia (none have yet been decided), but Blumenthal believes that his suit will be the one that survives a challenge on standing grounds.  The clause specifically says that the President needs the consent of Congress to receive this money from foreign countries, so he s deprived us of the chance to give our consent,  Blumenthal said.  I think that s enough for us to get into court. Notably, if Judge Emmet Sullivan, of the federal district court in Washington, allows the case to proceed, the plaintiffs may be allowed to obtain Trump s elusive tax returns as part of the discovery process.So there s that. Looks like Mr. PhonyPants McDraftDodger was doing a little projecting about Vietnam because he was afraid of the war Blumenthal is bringing down on him, right here at home.Blumenthal had the last laugh:Mr. President: Your bullying hasn't worked before and it won't work now.

Senator Warren criticizes Equifax potential to profit from breach,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Equifax Inc (EFX.N) on Wednesday, saying it failed to protect customers adequately  after a massive data breach and stood to gain financially from a hack that exposed information on more than 140 million people. “The breach of your system has actually created more business opportunities for you,” Warren, a Democrat known for her consumer advocacy, told former Equifax Chief Executive Officer Richard Smith during his second congressional grilling this week. In addition to providing consumer credit reports, Equifax offers products to protect people’s data from misuse.  Warren said this business mix creates a conflict of interest by making Equifax responsible for protecting consumer data while allowing it to profit from consumers’ attempts to mitigate the breach.  “Equifax is making money, millions of dollars off its own screw-up and meanwhile the potential cost to Equifax are shockingly low,” Warren told Smith, 57, during the U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing. Smith retired from the credit reporting company last week but led it during the time of the breach, which it disclosed last month. Smith conceded the hack created an opportunity for fraud, and the company could profit from consumers seeking to protect their data. But he defended Equifax’s social utility. The company gathers data on consumers which it then sells to banks to allow them to better assess a borrower’s creditworthiness.  “The company has been around for 118 years and for most of those 118 years has done good things,” Smith said.  Following the hearing, Warren told reporters that Equifax’s new product allowing individuals to “lock” and “unlock” their credit reports does not provide sufficient protection and only a change in law can fully shield people’s information. “It only applies to Equifax. Consumers are now vulnerable to the loss of their data and some thief going through one of the other credit reporting agencies. That’s why we need to change the law. We need to make it in place forever and make sure consumers have control over their own data,” she said. Wednesday’s hearing was the second of four hearings for Smith this week as lawmakers scrutinize the breach. Several lawmakers on Wednesday also questioned why Equifax had been granted a contract with the Internal Revenue Service to help verify taxpayer data. Speaking before Congress on Tuesday, Smith repeatedly apologized for the breach, saying it took weeks for the credit bureau to understand the extent of the intrusion.

"Trump says Clinton could shoot someone, not be prosecuted","PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump once famously said he could shoot someone on New York’s Fifth Avenue and not lose voters. Now he says his rival Hillary Clinton could shoot someone in an arena in front of 20,000 people and not be prosecuted. At a rally on Friday before thousands of cheering supporters in Pensacola, Florida, Trump had more harsh words for the Democratic presidential nominee in the fallout over their crossfire at a televised national security forum in New York on Wednesday. “Because she’s being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, okay?” he said. “That is what’s happened to this country. I never thought I’d see the day where this has happened to our country,” he added. Trump’s charge is that Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, has profited from a “rigged” political system. He has repeatedly denounced the FBI’s decision not to prosecute Clinton for her use of a private email server and the handling of classified information.  As a newcomer to politics, Trump has used colorful language in the past to describe fervent support for him. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa last January.

“DEAL WITH IT”: YOU’LL LOVE WHAT TRUMP CHOSE TO SYMBOLIZE His Love For America In TIME Magazine Interview [VIDEO],"Trump s not backing down from his  in your face  style anytime soon. That s the problem with our country, we don t have fighters in our country. And his critics are just gonna have to  deal with it. Donald Trump is on the cover of Time magazine, and the headline reads:  Deal with it. The meme-worthy photo shoot features the Republican presidential hopeful posing with a 27-year-old American bald eagle   the emblem of the United States. Every frame was the same,  Schoeller told TIME.  Mr. Trump knows exactly how he looks, and he strikes one pose and doesn t move. The same could not be said for 27-year-old Uncle Sam, who was hit by a car in the 1990s and has since segued into a life on the educational and entertainment circuits. He s very difficult to photograph,  said Schoeller.  If you ask him to look up a little bit, he says no or he just doesn t do it. He literally has one angle. If I ask him to smile, he puts on a big grin and then he goes back to his Zoolander  blue steel  look. The  blue steel  look appears, sans eagle, on the cover of this week s TIME.It s a look America has grown very accustomed to since Trump became a household name in the 1980s and one they ve been showing their love for more than ever in recent months.The Republican front-runner said it all on Wednesday that when it comes to the polls in the crowded 2016 presidential race,  the only thing constant is Trump.

I m doing this to make America great again. Here is a great interview by Entertainment Tonight:Trump told TIME magazine,  I don t have a racist bone in my body.

Patrick Henningsen and Don DeBar Discuss Trump’s ‘Immigration Ban’ and the Media Reaction,"Sputnik Radio s new program Trend Storm is hosted by American geopolitical analyst and writer Andrew Korybko. This week, Andrew explores what s really driving the media uproar and political protests surrounding President Trump s executive order on immigration Andrew Korybko Trend StormUS President Donald Trump s controversial Executive Order to temporarily limit the entrance of select foreign nationals to the US is becoming a larger-than-life scandal of epic proportions.Following through on yet another of his campaign promises, America s new leader has banned people from seven countries from entering the US, building off of the list of supposedly terrorist-prone countries that his predecessor first identified. The immediacy of the order caught many people off guard, and there was confusion about whether it would apply to permanent residents (green card-holders), already-vetted refugees, and individuals in transit. Almost immediately after the announcement was made last Friday, thousands of people across the US flocked to their local airports to protest the measure. In doing so, they defied what are ordinarily strict security measures, which during regular times would prohibit such large-scale gatherings at locations considered essential to the nation s infrastructure.The protesters claimed that Trump had  banned Muslims  from entering the US, and the hashtag #MuslimBan instantly started trending on Twitter. In defense of the motion, Trump and his surrogates said that most majority-Muslim countries were untouched by the temporary border restrictions, pointing out that Indonesia   the world s most populous Muslim country   isn t on the list, for example. Moreover, in a cynical retort to the critics, they reminded the public that Obama had earlier suspended the US refugee program for Iraqi nationals for half a year back in 2011, though no such protests erupted at that time. Nevertheless, it s hard for the Trump Administration to shake the social media stigma that this is a  Muslim Ban , no matter how convincingly they may argue that it amounts to nothing more than a brief review period for high-risk countries prior to the implementation of what s being called  extreme vetting.  This is because the mainstream US media is very sympathetic to what Trump and his spokespeople have termed the  political opposition,  namely, the Democratic Party.The perception management and narrative-building that these two institutions are known for was seen vividly and on full display during the presidential campaign, but it s gotten even more intense since Trump s election. Just like back then, however, it doesn t seem to be doing its intended job, since a Reuters poll released on Tuesday found that 49% of Americans are in favor of the President s action, while 41% are against it.Patrick Henningsen, Founder and Executive Editor of 21stCenturyWire.com and the host of the Sunday Wire Show, and Don DeBar, host of a syndicated daily radio newscast CPR News heard across the US, commented on the issue  .

Louisiana governor says state's finances in dire situation,"(Reuters) - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards presented a dire picture of the state’s fiscal situation on Thursday, urging lawmakers to consider a set of budget cuts and revenue-raising measures, including tax increases. Edwards made his remarks before state legislators convene for a special session on Sunday to hash out how to fix the budget woes. The state is contending with a $940 million budget deficit for the current fiscal year and a $2 billion projected deficit for the next fiscal year starting in July. “This is a historic fiscal crisis, the likes of which our state has never seen,” Edwards said during Thursday’s televised address. He warned that the state’s public colleges and universities will face “catastrophic cuts over the next four months.” Louisiana is at risk of not being able to pay student scholarships that have already been awarded, and some campuses will be forced to cancel classes, even file for bankruptcy. “If you are a student attending one of these universities, it means that you will receive a grade of incomplete, many students will not be able to graduate,” said Edwards. “You can say farewell to college football next fall.” The governor also warned that the state’s healthcare system was “on the verge of imploding.” Without new revenues, hospitals that care for a significant portion of poor and under-insured patients would close in places like Lake Charles, Alexandria and Bogalusa. “I don’t say this to scare you. But I am going to be honest with you. No more tricks. No more smoke and mirrors,” said Edwards, a Democrat who took office last month. Louisiana’s former Governor Bobby Jindal had signed a “no tax” pledge, which handicapped the state from raising new revenues. Edwards on Thursday juxtaposed Louisiana’s finances when Jindal took office in 2008 - when the state enjoyed a $1 billion surplus - to today, when the state is facing a looming $2 billion projected deficit. The budget problems in Louisiana, a big oil-producing state, stem in part from the global drop in oil prices, in addition to the state’s reliance in recent years on one-time money and lower-than-expected revenues.  Edwards has proposed several budget fixes, including a 1-cent sales tax hike and increases to alcohol and cigarette taxes. He would freeze hiring for state workers, reduce state contracts, and cut $160 million of state funding. He has also proposed tapping $128 million from the rainy day fund and $200 million from non-coastal BP payments to reduce the current year deficit. ",politicsNews,"February 12, 2016 ",1,2580
White House proposes to privatize air traffic control,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is proposing to shift oversight of the U.S. air traffic control from the federal government to an independent group, according to budget documents released on Thursday. Trump, who called the U.S. air traffic control system “obsolete” in a meeting with airline executives last month, is proposing $16.2 billion for the Department of Transportation’s discretionary budget for fiscal year 2018, a reduction of 13 percent. Some Transportation Department budget items are paid through the highway gas tax fund. The document says Trump’s plan “initiates a multi-year reauthorization proposal to shift the air traffic control function of the Federal Aviation Administration to an independent, non-governmental organization.” Privatization advocates argue that spinning off air traffic control into a non-government entity would allow for a more efficient system and rapid, cost-effective improvements of technology, in part by avoiding the government procurement process. Opponents, including some airlines, say the U.S. system is so large that privatization would not save money, and would drive up ticket costs and could create a national security risk. There also are concerns that airlines would dominate the private-company board and limit access to airports by business jets. The budget would eliminate $175 million in annual funding for the Essential Air Service, a program to support commercial air service to rural airports and end subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service. Amtrak would then “focus on better managing” state-supported lines and service in the busy Northeast corridor, the budget document said. The Trump budget would also eliminate the Obama administration’s “TIGER” grant program, saving $499 million. That program has been used to fund a variety of transportation projects, including high-speed and intracity rail, highway construction and transit bus systems. The budget calls for cutting the budget of U.S. space agency NASA by 0.8 percent to $19.1 billion. The budget proposes cancelling the multi-billion-dollar Asteroid Redirect Mission, but funds development of the Orion crew vehicle and Space Launch System.  The budget calls for expanding public private partnerships. NASA has partnerships with Space Exploration Technologies and other companies.  The budget funds a mission to fly by Jupiter moon Europa, but cancels a multi-billion mission to land on the moon. It would also fund a Mars rover mission in 2020. The FAA is spending billions to implement “NextGen,” a system that would utilize satellites to monitor aircraft instead of radar and make other changes and has faced implementation challenges. The FAA said it has spent $7.5 billion on NextGen over the past seven years, which “has resulted in $2.7 billion in benefits to passengers and the airlines to date, and is expected to yield more than $160 billion in benefits through 2030.” Last month, Trump criticized spending on NextGen, saying the system was “totally out of whack,” over budget and behind schedule. The FAA handles more than 50,000 flights a day and more than 700 million passengers each year. It spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has about 28,000 air traffic control personnel. Since 1987, several countries have moved responsibility for air traffic control from national civil aviation authorities to independent self-financed providers. The Government Accountability Office said in a 2016 report that the United States “is generally considered to have the busiest, most complex and safest ATC system in the world.” ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2017 ",1,3711
" Hillary Clinton Retweets Bernie Sanders, And For A Good Reason (IMAGE)","Over the course of this latest presidential campaign there has been a lot said about both sides by both sides of the Democratic primary. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are formidable candidates and stand heads above any Republican candidate running. Supporters on both sides are very passionate about their candidate, and for the most part, when it comes down to it, agree on what needs to be done, just differing on how to go about implementing those changes.In another great example of both sides agreeing on something very important, Bernie Sanders tweeted out,  America s first black president cannot and will not be succeeded by a hatemonger who refuses to condemn the KKK.  A statement that is absolutely true, and retweeting in agreement was none other than Hillary Clinton herself.via TwitterSanders is exactly right. We CANNOT have a candidate like Donald Trump, who retweets Mussolini quotes, and doesn t condemn the KKK, anywhere near the Oval Office. It s not only a horrible prospect, but outright terrifying. It would set the progress made by the U.S. back over half a century.Clinton is right to back up this statement, because this is something, no matter which candidate you support, you should be able to easily and fervently agree with. It s good to see the candidates standing with one another on this subject, because it is so utterly important. Either candidate would be a great president, and we need to remember to vote blue in November to keep Trump out of the White House.Featured image: Instagram/Instagram/Twitter",News,"February 28, 2016",0,1621

Sidelined healthcare lobby stymies Republican healthcare effort,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans pushing to overhaul Obamacare largely ignored key players in the debate over insuring the poor: the health insurers and hospitals charged with carrying out the law if it gets approved. Instead, conservative groups such as Heritage Action for America won the ears of Senate Republicans when it came to changing the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled. The snub is fueling health industry opposition to the new plans for Medicaid, and threatens to further frustrate the months-long effort to dismantle Obamacare.  The latest version of the Senate bill, released on Thursday, left the Medicaid overhaul largely unchanged from the radical makeover in the bill from the U.S. House of Representatives. A nonpartisan government agency has estimated an earlier version of the bill would trim nearly $800 billion in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years. While insurers successfully influenced the legislation when it comes to individual insurance markets, the fact that they and hospital groups largely struck out on Medicaid is important because the new provisions shift more costs back to the states and hospitals.  These groups, along with insurers, will be charged with enforcing the new law, so Republicans need their buy-in, health policy experts say.  “A health policy means nothing if it can’t be implemented and doesn’t work,” said Andy Slavitt, former administrator under President Barack Obama of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversaw Obamacare. The Republican bill ends Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and slashes traditional Medicaid funding, with cuts that deepen beginning in 2025. The U.S. House of Representatives passed its own version of the legislation in May.  “A lot of conservatives, Heritage Action included, desperately wanted to hold the line to make sure the Medicaid portion wasn’t watered down in the Senate,” said Dan Holler, vice president of Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group. “It was something we made known to folks up in the Senate.”  When Democrats and the White House enacted Obamacare seven years ago, support from healthcare companies helped propel the legislation through Congress. The administration actively courted the health industry, lobbyists and former Obama administration officials said, viewing their support as critical to winning votes. While health insurer and hospital lobbyists said in recent weeks that they have been able to regularly meet with Republican lawmakers, they said their input on the bill’s Medicaid changes was largely ignored. A representative for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was not immediately available for comment. In 2017, the top hospital, doctor and insurer trade groups reported spending a total of more than $13 million on lobbying the federal government through the first quarter of 2017, according to a congressional lobbying database.  One hospital industry lobbyist said there has been no attempt by Republican leadership to have a serious discussion with industry lobbyists or leaders about how to change the bill to win their support.  That has not been the case with the portion of the bill that addresses the individual insurance market. Insurers, including some of the biggest providers of Obamacare individual plans, Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Molina Healthcare (MOH.N), have been asking for changes to specific policies.  For instance, the Senate bill repeals the penalty associated with the individual mandate, the requirement that all people purchase insurance or pay a government fee. In its place, insurers received one of their biggest demands: a provision in the bill that provides incentives for Americans to have continuous insurance coverage and allows insurers to charge them more if they let their policies lapse.  If that back and forth between industry and lawmakers on the individual insurance side ends up winning new conservative votes, lawmakers may be ready to turn the next round of healthcare bill negotiations to Medicaid, said Elizabeth Carpenter, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consultant group to hospitals and insurers “The rubber meets the road on the Medicaid provision,” Carpenter said.

U.S. Patent and Trademark Office head Michelle Lee resigns,"(Reuters) - U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Director Michelle Lee, who has won praise from technology companies for taking steps to minimize abusive patent litigation, resigned from her position on Tuesday, a spokesman for the agency has confirmed. She joined the agency in 2012 and became interim director in 2013 before being formerly nominated as director by then-President Barack Obama in 2014.  Some inventors and patent licensing companies had opposed Lee, who was previously an in-house lawyer for Alphabet Inc’s Google. The patent office is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce that reviews applications for patents and trademarks. The agency is also empowered to cancel patents it has issued. Lee has been viewed favorably by the technology industry for ushering in more stringent standards for software patents. More than 50 companies, including Facebook Inc and Cisco Systems Inc, sent a letter to President Donald Trump and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in April urging them to retain Lee as director of the patent office.  The companies said in the letter that Lee’s efforts at the patent office had led to a decrease in abusive litigation filed by so-called “patent trolls.” The Trump administration has yet to put forth a nominee for the position, which required Senate confirmation.

" Body-Slamming Republican Thought He Was Too Important To Be Booked, Printed, Judge Says No Way","You may remember Greg Gianforte, the Republican who won Montana s only Congressional seat in May even after assaulting reporter Ben Jacobs of the Guardian. He disputed the charge at first, then audio came out that clearly depicted him body-slamming the journalist after Jacobs asked a series of uncomfortable questions.Gianforte pled guilty to the charge back in June, although it had no bearing on the outcome of his post-assault election. Presumably, the voters of Montana thought Jacobs had it coming, or perhaps they re so committed to their political party that even an assault charge won t deter them from voting for a GOP candidate.At the time, the Tea Party lawmaker protested the judge s order that he be booked and fingerprinted, as well as have his photo taken for a mug shot. His lawyers argued that the judge didn t have the authority to order the proceedings since he was never actually handcuffed and arrested formally   a feat he pulled off by coincidentally being the candidate the local Sheriff had made political donations to during his campaign.Now, despite his legal team s argument that he was exempt because he was only charged with a misdemeanor, a judge has ordered that Gianforte turn himself in by September 15th for booking on the charge. If the congressman doesn t comply, the judge said, he will be held in contempt of court.Although Gianforte has paid his fines, apologized to Jacobs, and donated $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, he has yet to complete his community service. There is no word whether he has followed through on the anger management classes he was ordered to attend.Practically speaking, a mugshot should worry the congressman when it comes time for reelection. Campaign ads could use it freely, as they are public record. But the question remains whether Gianforte, who raised nearly $120,000 in donations after admitting to the assault, has anything to worry about at all with the voters of Montana.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"August 21, 2017",0,2106
JUST IN: AS ANOTHER ACCUSER COMES FORWARD…JohnConyers Makes Major Announcement…It’s Not What The Media Expected,"What pushed Democrat Congressman John Conyers to resign instead of just announce he would retire at the end of his term?The Detroit Free Press reports another accuser came forward just last night:The most recent, Elisa Grubbs, made accusations against Conyers on Monday night, saying in a statement that Conyers put his hand up her skirt at a church, among other allegations.As late as Tuesday morning, there were reports that Conyers would fight on, choosing to remain in office til the end of his current term and then retire in early 2019. But speaking on Mildred Gaddis  show on WPZR-FM (102.7), Conyers said he was resigning.FORCED TO RESIGN:Facing a rising chorus of voices demanding he step down because of sexual harassment claims, U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Detroit, resigned the seat he has held for more than five decades, a swift and crushing fall from grace for a civil rights icon and the longest-serving active member of Congress.ENDORSES HIS SON TO REPLACE HIM:Saying he was finalizing his plans for retirement, Conyers added he would endorse his son, John Conyers III, to replace him Congress. My legacy can t be compromised or dimished in any way by what we re going through now. This too shall pass.   My legacy will continue through my children,  Conyers told Mildred Gaddis on her Detroit radio show.As for the accusations against him, Conyers said,  They re not accurate, they re not true and they re something I can t explain where they came from. Conyers, 88, resigned two weeks after an article on BuzzFeed.com detailed a secret settlement of more than $27,000 with former staffer, MARION BROWN who accused him of making sexual advances toward her and paying her out of funds from his taxpayer-supported office.MARION BROWN CAME FORWARD WITH SHOCKING DETAILS:The descriptions below of what went on at the office of Rep. John Conyers will make your blood boil. He felt entitled to treat the women in his office like he owned them in every way. It s pretty disgusting.We re still waiting to hear what s going to happen with Conyers. Democrat leaders have called for him to resign but his lawyer has been pushing back trying to make the accuser look bad. He treads a fine line with his threats to the accuser and to others in D.C. We re hoping he spills the beans on the others who have used our tax dollars to pay off sexual harassment victims.Marion Brown, a former staff member whose accusations have sparked the scandal surrounding embattled U.S. Rep. John Conyers, described in an interview Thursday how the Detroit congressman allegedly created a hostile work environment for his female staffers and, at times, pressed her for sexual favors, particularly when his wife was away. He owns you when you are there,  Brown said in the interview with Stephen Henderson, host of  Detroit Today  on WDET-FM (101.9) and editorial page editor at the Free Press. At one time, it was said amongst staff members  females  that he thinks that his initials, J.C., stand for Jesus Christ,  she said.Brown said Conyers would  invite me to a hotel in the guise of business, and then it turns into something else.   And this happened too often. And that was throughout. She said the sexual advances intensified whenever his wife, Monica Conyers, was out of town. He seemed to have taken on the attitude that  I m gonna go for it now. My wife s away, and I have these needs and I m going to call you up in the middle of the night,   Brown said. I know it s because he decided that he wanted to stop the hunting game,  Brown said.  He had no more interest in trying to persuade and seduce me into, you know, sex  or being his side piece. During that interview, she shared details of Conyers  alleged sexual advances toward her, including how Conyers in 2005 allegedly invited her to his Chicago hotel room and, while in his underwear, pointed to his genitals and asked her to  touch it.

Spanish markets rise on report of possible Catalan election,"LONDON (Reuters) - Spanish government bonds and stocks were in demand on Thursday after a media report said Catalonian President Carles Puigdemont was set to call a snap regional election for Dec. 20, a move that could ease tensions with Madrid.  Barcelona-based La Vanguardia said Puigdemont had taken the decision in a bid to persuade the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy not to enforce direct rule in the region. Puigdemont will make a statement at 1330 CET (1130 GMT), the regional government said.  This news is positive for Spain because it looks like Puigdemont is looking for ways other than declaring independence,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.   It sounds like he is calling these elections so that Madrid does not have to invoke article 155,  that would allow central government to suspend the wealthy region s autonomy. Spain s 10-year government bond yield - which moves inversely to price - fell 6 basis points to 1.58 percent on the news.  Spain s country stock index IBEX rose as much as 1.9 percent to a four-week high.  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year government bond yields   a keenly watched measure of market sentiment towards Spain   moved to its tightest in a month.  The spread between the two widened sharply earlier this month after Catalonia voted overwhelmingly in favor of breaking away from Spain, albeit on a low turnout, in an Oct. 1 referendum declared illegal by authorities in Madrid.

 Five Women Donald Trump Allegedly Slept With And How They Utterly Humiliated Him,"Donald Trump obviously has a knack for purchasing beautiful women. His first wife, Ivana, was a model from the Czech Republic who was famous for gaudy accessories and over-spending. Trump cheated on her and eventually married Marla Maples, who may have actually loved him for some reason but grew tired of him and moved on with a good chunk of his money. His current wife, Melania, is yet another Eastern European model who loves the lavish lifestyle he provides for her.In between the women who have allowed him to buy them, after the millions of dollars in divorce costs, Trump has always declared himself something of a ladies man. He and his ahem giant hands have been telling stories of his conquests for decades. The problem is, just like everything else about Trump, the stories are mostly exaggerations, outright lies or rumors that he enjoyed a little bit too much to dispel in good conscience like a decent human being. Go figure. Here s a list of five of the famous women Donald Trump has lied about dating and how they humiliated him when they had made his list:The former Olympic champion ice-skater was 41-years-old and happily married when her supposed affair with The Donald happened. After The New York Daily News reported her as a possible Trump fling, she felt she needed to respond since Trump decided not to dispel the rumor: The reason I m going public with my outrage over this allegation is that I had hoped that Donald Trump would issue his own statement of the rumor being completely unfounded, and that has not happened quickly enough,  she said.  I ve been around Donald Trump four times in my life. I wouldn t even call him a good friend. Ouch. Even though that happened in 1990, you just know it still stings the orange man s ego.The Dynasty Star who played Princess Diana in two TV movies told People that there was no truth at all to the rumors she and Trump were an item. Again Trump remained silent, allowing himself to be associated with yet another beautiful woman far out of his league: [He s] a complete joke as far as I m concerned. I hardly know the man,  Oxenburg told People in 1990.And another one down. No wonder he allowed his actual affair with Maples to go public. His reputation was taking a severe beating.The cosmetics mogul refused to give any credence to the rumor she and Trump were a thing, dispelling it with a simple  I don t know what you re talking about,  when asked by People. Trump never attempted to call her out, because the rumors he allowed to continue were obviously not true.The prominent swimsuit model and wife of NHL star Ron Greschner never bothered to answer the allegations she was into Trump. She allowed her manager, Steve Gutstein, to do it for her instead: Donald Trump is a fortunate man, but he s not that fortunate. That s another one that had to just hurt. Trump could very well have avoided all of the humiliation by telling the truth about these rumors when they happened   or by not starting them if he was the source   but he instead rode the wave of ignorance that has carried him towards the Republican nomination 26 years later.The socialite and designer who was married to Trump s billionaire acquaintance Henry Kravitz (it s a well-established fact that Trump doesn t have friends), said the rumors were  ridiculous.  She added,  I m married to the greatest man in the world.  Those are words Trump has probably heard quite often himself   after he buys something extravagant.To his credit, there was one rumor Trump decided to debunk on his own. In the prime of Mike Tyson s career, Trump was accused of a fling with Robin Givens. It s not too difficult to figure out why. Featured image From Getty Images, modified",News,"April 15, 2016",0,3787
"Obama, Saudi prince focus on Iraq and Syria in Washington meeting","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday discussed ways to support Iraqis in their fight against Islamic State militants and the importance of a political transition in war-torn Syria, the White House said. Obama met with Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval office for about an hour. The deputy crown prince is visiting the United States to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as Vision 2030, to slash the kingdom’s dependence on oil exports. “The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s contributions to the campaign against ISIL,” the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.  The two talked about steps to support Iraqis “including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs,” the White House said.  U.S. officials have expressed unease about the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which according to the United Nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia is worried about closer relations between the United States and Iran, Riyadh’s arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal.   Obama welcomed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to a political settlement of the Yemen conflict and support by the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the White House said.  On Syria, Obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from President Bashar al-Assad, the White House said. The United States is working with international partners on what it calls a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the United Nations, but so far there has been little progress.  Over 50 diplomats at the U.S. State Department signed a memo, leaked on Thursday, that was critical of the Obama administration’s Syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against Assad’s government.  Asked about the memo, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, also in Washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a “more robust intervention” including airstrikes, a no-fly zone, and a no-drive zone, from the beginning of the five-year civil war.  Obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, White House spokeswoman Jen Friedman said.  Both Washington and Riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a U.S. report into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some U.S. lawmakers have alleged link Saudi government officials to the attacks. Jubeir said investigations show that the allegations “are not correct and they don’t hold.”  ",politicsNews,"June 17, 2016 ",1,2738

"Obama discriminated against coal, nuclear: U.S. energy secretary","CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - The United States discriminated against the nuclear and coal industries under the administration of former President Barack Obama, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said on Wednesday. “Nuclear and coal ... Those two industries were discriminated against over the course of the last administration,” Perry told reporters at an oil conference in Cape Town, when asked about a U.S. government directive to support ageing coal and nuclear plants.  The directive would reward certain nuclear and coal-fired plants that store 90 days of fuel on site for contributing to the reliability of the national grid. U.S. industries that rarely agree, including gas drillers and renewable energy producers, oppose it on the grounds that it props up “uneconomic generation.” Asked about threats to U.S. energy supplies, Perry, a former governor of the oil hub of Texas, cited cyber security as the main concern followed by natural disasters such as hurricanes.

 This Trump Supporter May Literally Be The Dumbest Person On Earth (VIDEO),"When trying to figure out who these people are who are actually considering voting for Trump, or have already, two things come to mind   they re either racist or just dumber than a bag of bricks.Trump has been so vague on policy and his supporters simply don t seem to care. They hear about his hatred of Muslims and Mexicans and come running in droves. His plans: a wall, the best wall; healthcare, the best healthcare; military, the best military; education, the best education; guns. He literally offers no specifics. He just says what comes to mind and these imbecilic supporters cheer. Watch any rally and you ll soon realize that he s not running for the nation, he s running for himself. Count how many times he mentions polls. Notice how few times he mentions legitimate policy ideas. Keep track of how many times he uses  me,   my  or  I. This vagueness is working though, because while at a diner in Nashville, Tennessee, Anna Kooiman of Fox News spoke with a Trump supporter by the name of Austin who said Trump is a  proven businessman who has employed tens of thousands of people, he s a man that knows how to get the job done right. Austin is basically just repeating, verbatim, what Trump says at every single one of his rallies and events. Trump proclaims over and over that he is a  great  businessman who has  employed tens of thousands of people  and  knows how to get the job done right.  It s pretty much guaranteed that he ll say this at the next debate as well.When Kooiman pressed this Trump supporter on why he thinks Trump isn t specific on any policy, he replied: I am not concerned about that. I think he is not being specific so he does not give his competition everything that he s doing so they copy him. And Fox News being Fox News, Kooiman said,  There s a great theory there and he s a dealmaker. So, let s get this straight, Trump isn t being specific because he doesn t want people to copy him? That s his grand plan to lure voters. That s like a salesman saying,  I have this thing, and you re gonna love it, I just can t tell you what it is until you buy it.  Who in their right mind would buy something they know nothing about? Apparently, this guy Austin in Nashville.Trump really wasn t kidding when he said he loves the  poorly educated.

"U.S. internet firms ask Trump to support encryption, ease regulations","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. internet companies including Facebook Inc and Amazon Inc have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms. The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet’s Google, Uber and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign. “The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue,” reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters. Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump’s priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict U.S. internet companies from growing in that market. Other goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign.  They include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to U.S. government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally.  The association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was “softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country.” While urging support for trade agreements, the letter does not mention the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump has repeatedly assailed with claims it was poorly negotiated and would take jobs away from U.S. workers. The technology sector supported the deal, but members of Congress have conceded since the election it is not going to be enacted.  Trump’s often-shifting policy proposals on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and sometimes elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda. Trump has also urged a boycott of Apple Inc products over the company’s refusal to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone associated with last year’s San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon, and demanded that tech companies such as Apple manufacture their products in the United States. In a statement, Beckerman said the internet industry looked forward to working closely with Trump and lawmakers in Congress to “cement the internet’s role as a driver of economic and social progress for future generations.” ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2016 ",1,3317

GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP Place Political Careers Before National Security: Why They Are Reportedly Caving (Again) To Democrats,"Is this why we worked so hard to get a GOP majority in the House and Senate? Spineless weasels Republican House members blasted their GOP leadership Wednesday for caving to Democratic leaders  demand that they abandon the House s bipartisan bill to tighten screening of refugee applicants from Syria and Iraq. The bill to bolster the Syrian and Iraqi [refugee] vetting process passed with a veto-proof majority and is supported by a vast majority of Americans,  said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC)57% , who is one of the two co-authors of the original House bill that GOP leaders are now abandoning. It would be a shame to bow to the wishes of Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and the White House, leaving our country vulnerable to foreign terrorism,  he told Breitbart News exclusively.After the Paris attacks that killed over 120 people, the House passed a bill   with a huge bipartisan majority   that would implement tough screening requirements for refugees. The bill was criticized by Democrats and President Obama, who vowed to veto the legislation and suggested that Republicans work with them to tighten oversight of visas given to legal visitors.Now, House Republican leaders are reportedly planning to abandon their original idea to tighten screening of refugees and are instead caving to Democrats who want to only fix security gaps in the legal-visitor visa program.Republican House leadership is backing away from the refugee problem because they fear their fix will be rejected by Democrats and lead to a partial government shut-down.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) also told Breitbart News exclusively that he isn t  surprised  that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) is following in the steps of former House Speaker Rep. John Boehner (R-OH)32% by bowing to Democrats, rather than putting up a fight.He called the original vote  a show vote  that was arranged by the leaders, and told Breitbart News that the entire refugee program needs to be stripped of its funding.Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) told Breitbart News exclusively that GOP House leadership should fix both problems.  This should not be an either or question,  Babin said.  Both should be addressed in a timely manner. We should concern ourselves first and foremost with the safety and security of the American people. Babin recently released a letter, signed by more than 70 of his colleagues, calling on House leadership to include language in the must-pass omnibus spending bill that would defund the refugee resettlement program. More than 70 of my colleagues joined me in calling for an immediate suspension in the refugee program to give us time to put in place security measures that the Administration has failed to implement  Babin told Breitbart News. We must restore Congressional authority and ensure that Congress has a final sign-off on any Administration proposed Security measures. Congress has until December 11th to pass the omnibus bill.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Dec 2, 2015",0,3036
"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Blonde Clinton Neighbor, Dubbed The “Energizer” Gets $2 MILLION From Clinton “Charity”","Here s how Donald Trump reacted Donald Trump reacted Friday to a report that the Clinton Global Foundation provided millions to a power company partly owned by a rich, blond divorcee by saying that people have been whispering about her possible romantic ties to Bill Clinton for a long time.The  commitment  to Julie Tauber McMahon s firm from the Clinton Global Initiative was placed on its 2010 conference agenda at Clinton s urging, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.The initiative  commits $2 million to support the work of Energy Pioneer Solutions, a company founded to deliver energy savings to communities in rural America,  said a 2010 statement from the charity. People have been talking about this for years. I have no idea what went on. I certainly don t,  the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said on  Fox & Friends. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Clinton Global Initiative doled out $2 million to Energy Pioneer Solutions, which is partly owned by Julie Tauber McMahon.The fit, blond mother of three, who lives just minutes from Bill and Hillary Clinton s home in Chappaqua, West chester, is the daughter of Joel Tauber, a millionaire donor to the Democratic Party.McMahon, 54, is rumored to be the woman dubbed  Energizer  by the Secret Service at the Clinton home because of her frequent visits, according to RadarOnline.Secret Service agents were even given special instructions to abandon usual protocol when the woman came by, according to journalist Ronald Kessler s tell-all book,  The First Family Detail. You don t stop her, you don t approach her, you just let her go in,  says the book, based on agents  accounts. Energizer  is described in the book as a charming visitor who sometimes brought cookies to the agents.The book describes one sun-drenched afternoon when agents took notice of the woman s revealing attire. It was a warm day, and she was wearing a low-cut tank top, and as she leaned over, her breasts were very exposed,  an agent is quoted in the book as saying. Energizer  reportedly timed her arrivals and departures around Hillary Clinton s schedule.When asked about whether there should be a probe into money directed from the foundation   a charity   to the company, Trump said:  Well, I assume you put the word  charity  in quotes. The interviewer, who cited the New York Post s cover story, told Trump that Clinton helped steer an $812,000 federal grant to the company through then-Energy Secretary Steven Chu.The interviewer also pointed out that  nonprofits are not supposed to act in anyone s private interests.

 MSNBC Shocks Viewers By Announcing Prime Time ‘Town Hall’ Special To Promote Donald Trump,"It s come to this.On Tuesday, MSNBC announced that it would be organizing a live,  prime time  event exclusively starring Donald Trump and hosted by Trump s personal friends Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinksi. Needless to say, both political insiders and MSNBC s viewers are shaking their heads in disbelief.The decision to give Trump free promotional airtime on the network was announced by Morning Joe s Senior Producer Jesse Rodriguez.NEWS: Joe & Mika will moderate a town hall with Donald Trump airing in prime time tomorrow at 8pmET @MSNBC  Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) February 16, 2016The Republican front-runner will seemingly get the stage to himself. MSNBC has so far not announced a single other candidate would be appearing, nor did they suggest any were invited. He will be met with questions lobbed to him by Scarborough, who has used his influence to shill for Trump and may even be helping his campaign from behind the scenes. Recently, Trump thanked Scarborough, one of MSNBC s few conservative pundits, for  supporting  him when the rest of the media had attacked him.When not preparing to question Trump on a  prime time  spectacle, Scarborough spends his time online promoting Trump as a strong leader.Perceived strength in the face of perceived weakness from America's leaders. What do you think? https://t.co/JNwIhgrdN0  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 16, 2016""Donald Trump's strength is strength."" @JoeNBC on #morningjoe. Could it be that simple?

It also has reporters, used to covering candidates with some semblance of objectivity, scratching their heads.CNN will have all six GOP candidates appear at town halls on Wed and Thurs. Meanwhile, MSNBC s Joe and Mika hosting one Wed with just Trump.

Things came to a head when CNN reporter Dylan Byers outed Scarborough as having celebrated Trump s New Hampshire victory with the candidate in his hotel room. Notably, CNN plans to run a town hall event featuring two of Trump s biggest rivals, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, on Wednesday, so this may be an alliance between MSNBC and Trump to hurt CNN s ratings by hosting their very own special.Sadly, that means Trump will get carte blanche to spew his vile hate speech to a gushing Scarborough. It s unlikely that Trump would have agreed to appear on the left-leaning network if he thought there was any chance he was going to be pressed to answer difficult questions.For their part, MSNBC says they will balance Trump s  prime time event  with something they call  long form interviews  with other candidates. They point to one they will be airing with Kasich on the same night as Trump s town hall. But they haven t specified when they plan on airing other interviews candidates, nor if those interviews even exist.Cable networks aren t required to give equal time to each candidate (a situation Trump has routinely exploited), but holding a prime time glorified Donald Trump campaign ad is a very bad look for a network that is hoping to appear neutral. It also seems to skirt the line between a campaign donation. In a race where buying television ads can cost a campaign millions of dollars, how fair is it that MSNBC just handed over an hour or two of their most valuable ad space to Trump s campaign?There are already rumblings of a potential boycott, and MSNBC may just discover that there are limits to what its viewers will tolerate.Feature image via MSNBC",News,"February 16, 2016",0,4208

"New Zealand's ruling Nationals win most votes, New Zealand First Party kingmaker","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s ruling National Party won the largest number of votes in the country s general election on Saturday, securing a comfortable margin over the Labour Party after what had promised to be the most hotly contested race in recent history. National and Labour had been almost neck and neck in opinion polls, with charismatic 37-year old Jacinda Ardern almost single-handedly dragging Labour back into the race after taking over the party s leadership in August. National took 46 percent of the vote, the Electoral Commission said, while support for Labour was 35.8 percent. A final tally including overseas votes will be released on Oct. 7. The results set up the nationalist New Zealand First Party to hold the balance of power and form the next government with 7.5 percent of the ballot. Veteran New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has been minister under both major parties and has not said which party he would favor as a coalition partner. Previously he has backed the party with the largest number of votes. All party leaders said they would have conversations over the next few days, with some of them already trying to woo Peters on election night.  I want to acknowledge the strong performance of Winston Peters and New Zealand First,  Bill English said in a speech to his supporters.   The voters of New Zealand have given New Zealand First a role in forming the next government,  he said. For English, who campaigned heavily on National s economic credentials after taking the party leadership last year, the strong showing was a vindication after National crashed to its worst ever election result in 2002 under his first stint as leader.  Opinion polls leading up to the vote had been volatile with two recent ones giving National a near 10 point lead over Labour. National has been in power for nearly a decade.  Bill English and National have taken the largest number of votes. I ve called Bill and acknowledged that,  Ardern told her supporters, adding she was planning conversations with both the Green and New Zealand First parties.  It s not over yet.   Peters sounded buoyant but kept his cards close to his chest.  We have been strong enough and honest enough with our supporters to make it home,  he said. New Zealand First had  not all the cards but we do have the main cards,  he added, saying he would not be rushed into giving any answers immediately. Ardern and English were expected to maintain fiscal prudence, but to differ on monetary policy, trade and immigration. That would likely have implications for the New Zealand dollar, the world s 11th most-traded currency in 2016. The New Zealand dollar has tended to rise when National rose in the polls.  The thin trading conditions typical of early morning in Asia mean a sharp but short-lived move on the NZD is possible on Monday,  said Joseph Carpuso, senior currency strategist at CBA.  New Zealand uses a German-style proportional representation system in which a party, or combination of parties, needs 61 of Parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government. The results secured 58 seats for National in parliament, and 45 for Labour. New Zealand First has nine seats and Greens, which won 5.8 percent of the votes, have seven. National s 58 seats were higher than Labour and Greens put together at 52, but neither combination had enough to govern on their own.  It s all over, bar the special votes - but even they won t change the basic maths. They won t change any crucial seats and National is extremely unlikely to go up. So Winston Peters rules,  said Bryce Edwards, analyst at Wellington-based Critical Politics. A record 1.2 million ballots were cast before the day of the election, accounting for about a third of the 3.3 million New Zealanders enrolled to vote.   Special votes , which include ballots from New Zealanders overseas and those who vote outside their home constituencies, will be released on Oct. 7. These are estimated to represent 15 percent of total votes and could have a considerable impact.  I would expect us to get a bit of a lift out of those special votes,  said Ardern.

" Donald Trump Has His ‘ISIS Attacked My Rally’ Hoax Blown Wide Open, Live On-Air (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has been caught using doctored video to claim that a protester who rushed the stage at a rally in Dayton, Ohio this week has links to ISIS. But during an interview with Chuck Todd, the whole scam fell apart, live on-air.The Republican front runner was seen to panic and sweat profusely on Saturday, when the secret service moved on a single protester at a rally in Dayton, Ohio.After the event, and clearly smarting from the very public unravelling of his  tough guy  persona, Trump sought to ratchet up the scale of the threat against him. Later that night, Trump tweeted his near 7 million followers on Twitter to let them know the protester was actually a  maniac  with  ties to ISIS  alongside a video he cites as evidence.USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage.

UP TO $1 MILLION TO BE DONATED TO WOUNDED WARRIOR PROJECT FROM SALES OF “American Sniper” DVD,"Wounded Warrior Project has done so much to help so many veterans who have paid a heavy price for our freedom.

Lang Award for Courage PRESENTED TO BRIAN KOLFAGE Jr. from Brian on Vimeo.Sales from the newly released DVD of American Sniper are expected to generate a million dollars for the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), a charitable organization founded to  honor and empower  U.S. veterans and armed service members who incurred a physical or mental injury after 9/11.A Warner Bros. production company statement says that one dollar of each purchase of the DVD, between its release on Tuesday and December 31, will be donated to WWP, up to $1 million from sales.American Sniper was based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle, a runaway bestseller which spent 18 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 13 of those at number one. Kyle is thought to have been the most lethal Navy SEAL sniper in American history with 160 confirmed kills.The blockbuster film, which was unabashedly pro-War on Terror, was a massive box office success and out-grossed every other film released in 2014, including The Hunger Games: Mockingjay   Part 1 and Guardians of the Galaxy. The film grossed some $543 million worldwide.According to The Christian Post, Kyle personally wanted Clint Eastwood to direct the film, and after his tragic death the producers approached Eastwood who agreed to sign on as director of the project.Together with his friend, Chad Littlefield, Kyle was shot and killed by a Marine that he was trying to help overcome PTSD while at a Texas gun range in 2013, not long before the film went into production.Chris Kyle was a Christian whose father served as a deacon and whose mother taught Sunday school. He believed in the morality of what he did as a Navy SEAL sniper, and felt that on Judgment Day he would have things to answer for, but that his service as a SEAL wouldn t be one of them. In his autobiography, Kyle wrote:I believe the fact that I ve accepted Jesus as my savior will be my salvation. But in that backroom or whatever it is when God confronts me with my sins, I do not believe any of the kills I had during the war will be among them. Everyone I shot was evil. I had good cause on every shot. They all deserved to die.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"May 21, 2015",0,2484
U.N. assisting thousands of migrants in Libyan smuggling hub,"TUNIS/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - U.N. agencies said on Monday they were trying to provide urgent help to large numbers of migrants held and then stranded in the smuggling hub of Sabratha as rival factions battled for control of the city. At least 4,000 migrants, including pregnant women, newborn babies and unaccompanied children, have been transferred from informal camps and housing to a hangar in the city since the clashes ended on Friday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said some 6,000 had been held at the informal sites. Hundreds of migrants who had left Sabratha arrived in Zuwara, about 25 km (15 miles) to the west, on foot along the beach, said Sadeeq Al-Jayash, head of Zuwara s emergency committee.  They come walking in groups ... for example there were various groups that came on Sunday   50, then 100 and 200 at night,  said Jayash. There were about 1,700 migrants currently in Zuwara  in desperate need of help , he said.  Sabratha has been the most common point of departure for mostly sub-Saharan African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean by boat from Libya.  But the number of crossings dropped sharply in July after an armed group struck a deal with officials from the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to block departures, under pressure from Italy and other European Union member states. That set off three weeks of fighting among rival factions that left at least 43 dead and 340 wounded, according to a new health ministry toll, and ended with the withdrawal of the armed group. The migrants who have since been rounded up were being held at sites that the group had controlled, local officials said.   We are seriously concerned by the large number of migrants caught up in recent developments in Sabratha,  Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya chief of mission, said in a statement.    Some migrants are being sent on to detention centers elsewhere in western Libya that are nominally under the control of the Tripoli government. IOM officials say those centers, which were housing some 5,000 migrants, risk being overwhelmed by the new arrivals. Conditions in the centers are often dire and abuse widespread.     Alternatives to detention must be found for migrants in Libya. In the meantime, IOM continues to provide direct humanitarian, health and psychosocial assistance to meet the urgent needs of the thousands of migrants being affected,  Belbeisi said.  Local sources have previously said that an estimated 10,000 migrants were being held in the Sabratha area. The head of Sabratha s department for countering illegal migration told Reuters on Saturday that help was badly needed as some migrants had received no food or water for six days. The UNHCR said it had approached Libyan authorities to ensure that refugees among the migrants were freed from detention. ",worldnews,"October 9, 2017 ",1,2910

Pope urges EU to rediscover unity if it wants a future,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in a major speech on Europe, on Saturday urged the European Union to  recover the sense of being a single community  if it wants a future of prosperity and fairness for all. Francis spoke at the end of a two-day conference at the Vatican called  Re-Thinking Europe . Dozens of participants attended, including European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, the vice president of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, and religious leaders. While the pope did not specifically mention the situation in Catalonia, where the region s leaders want to break away from Spain, or Britain s decision to leave the EU, he spoke often of solidarity, teamwork and mutual sacrifice.  A European Union that, in facing its crises, fails to recover a sense of being a single community that sustains and assists its members   and not just a collection of small interest groups   would miss out not only on one of the greatest challenges of its history, but also on one of the greatest opportunities for its own future,  he said.  Particular and nationalist agendas risk thwarting the courageous dreams of the founders of Europe,  he said. In his long speech, Francis appeared to warn against the dangers to Europe posed by populist anti-immigrant parties. In elections in Germany in September, Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured almost 13 percent of the vote, making it the third largest party and the first far-right party to win seats in more than half a century.  Extremist and populist groups are finding fertile ground in many countries; they make protest the heart of their political message, without offering the alternative of a constructive political project,  Francis said, without naming any group. History s first Latin American pope said politics had often gone astray, saying  Sadly, all too often we see how politics is becoming instead a forum for clashes between opposing forces.  In his address to the pope at the closing ceremony, Tajani, the European Parliament president, spoke of  risk of a return to intolerance and xenophobia . The pope called for immigrants to be welcomed to Europe as an enriching resource, rather than be seen as a threat. But, in an apparent assertion that immigration had to be controlled, he said that while authorities should have an  open heart  they should be able to  provide for the full integration, on the social, economic and political level  of newcomers.

Trump a 'monster' spawned by Republicans: Senate Democratic leader,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans have only themselves to blame for Donald Trump, a “monster” spawned by their constant partisan opposition to all major Obama administration initiatives, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday. “Republicans created him (Trump) by spending seven years appealing to some of the darkest forces in America,” said Reid. He spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate a day after presidential candidate Trump won a string of primary contests and consolidated his status as front-runner to be the Republican  nominee in the November election. Trump’s rise has alarmed many establishment Republicans, who are both critical of his positions and skeptical he can win the White House. Reid, known for occasionally delivering controversial statements on the Senate floor, said Trump was now the Republican standard-bearer, but he could destroy the party. “The reality is that Republican leaders are reaping what they’ve sown,” Reid said, recounting seven years’ worth of staunch Republican opposition to Obama’s initiatives. Republicans had decided from the start of Obama’s presidency in 2009 that he was an “illegitimate” president, said Reid, who is retiring at the end of this year.  Democrat Obama, the first African-American president, is in the final year of his second four-year term. His presidency has been marked by bitter battles with Republicans over fiscal affairs, a landmark law to expand healthcare coverage for the uninsured, immigration, banking reform and policies to tackle climate change. Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives since 2011. And while they took control of the Senate in 2015, they previously used their minority status deftly to challenge Obama. Some Republicans, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, have been outspoken in their opposition to Trump as the prospective party nominee, saying the New York billionaire’ s inflammatory rhetoric will lead to defeat in the general election. Nonetheless, Trump, 69, now looks near unstoppable to be the Republican running against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate - most likely Hillary Clinton. Among Trump’s more controversial proposals have been his call for a wall along the entire southwestern U.S. border to keep out Mexican immigrants. When Congress was attempting to pass a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 and 2014, many Republican lawmakers put the brakes on the measure, instead calling for tough border enforcement only.  “Now it’s time for Republicans to undo what they’ve done by denouncing Donald Trump,” Reid said. “Trump is the GOP’s Frankenstein monster. If the Republicans fail to stop Donald Trump, he’ll tear the party apart even more than it is now.”   (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Eric Beech and Frances Kerry) This article was funded in part by SAP.

BREAKING: GUN STORE OWNER Claims He DID Report Florida Terrorist To FBI Weeks Before Massacre,"If you see something say something and maybe, if the FBI isn t too busy spending all of their time and resources investigating a presidential candidate who should already be in jail, they ll do something about it A gun store owner reported Orlando shooter Omar Mateen to authorities weeks before he committed the worst mass shooting in US history.Robbie Abell, co-owner of Lotus Gunworks, told the Wall Street Journal Mateen came into the store in South Florida in May and asked for heavy-duty body armor like the kind used by law enforcement.Staff at the store, which does not sell body armor, felt it was a strange demand.After his request was denied, Mateen asked to buy bulk ammunition.Though Lotus does sell ammunition, staff shut down his request and refused to sell him anything else.They subsequently reported the incident to the FBI, Abell said. Mateen had already been investigated by the FBI years before. But even after Abell s report, the 29-year-old self-radicalized gunman obtained an AR-15 and a semiautomatic pistol from another store in the area, bought stacks of ammunition, then opened fire on Pulse nightclub, where he killed 49 people and wounded 53.The store s owner Robbie Abell told the Journal:  The questions he was asking were not the normal questions a normal person would be asking He just seemed very odd.  Abell also said Mateen was speaking to someone on the phone in Arabic and was walking around the store texting.He added that staff were on high alert since authorities has recently warned them to look out for suspicious activity in the area.Abell did not specify which authorities gave this warning. Port St Lucie police said they did not receive a report about Mateen s suspicious behavior.The FBI has yet to comment.Once it emerged that Mateen was the perpetrator of the worst mass shooting in history, Abell said, Lotus staff instantly recognized him and reported their experience to the FBI.For entire story: Daily Mail ",left-news,"Jun 17, 2016",0,2055
 Trump Delivers Bizarre Theory About Fire Marshal Trying To Keep His Rally Safe (VIDEO),"During a campaign rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado on Friday, Donald Trump delivered a bizarre theory about the local fire marshal. Trump was very upset that the fire marshal prevented thousands of people who had come to see him speak from entering the venue, which would have created a huge fire hazard that would have put thousands of his supporters lives in danger.Trump told the audience that these are the types of regulations that are the reason  Our country doesn t work. So I have to tell you this. This is why our country doesn t work. We have plenty of space here. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. And we have a fire marshal that said,  Oh we can t allow more people. Trump then went on to blast the fire marshal and the fire department claiming that they don t know how to do their jobs. The jobs that they are trained to do in order to keep people safe. As if that wasn t bad enough, Trump then offers the only reason his brain can come up with as to why the fire marshal might be enforcing regulations that were created probably long before his clown show rolled into town. The reason they won t let them in is because they don t know what the hell they re doing,  Trump said.  That s why, okay? Too bad. That s why our country has   hey, maybe they re a Hillary person.

 Ted Cruz’s Dirtiest Little Secret Has Been Right Under Our Noses The Whole Time (VIDEO),"It s fairly well-known that Ted Cruz has few friends, if any at all, in and around the beltway. Cruz has spent the better part of the last two years alienating every single member of Congress possible while showing a level of disrespect for the president that can only be described as disgusting.Ted Cruz stood on the Senate Floor and had himself a little temper tantrum when the Republican leadership passed the omnibus package without defunding Planned Parenthood. He has been known as a know-it-all who nobody likes going back all the way to the Dubyah campaign. How many Texas Republicans ended up NOT working in the White House or nearby? Well there was Ted Cruz.Why nobody likes him is a question of character, You can tell just by looking at him that he s a freak just waiting for a phone call from his mother telling him Jesus said it was OK to nuke North Korea. You can tell when you listen to him speak that his real parents were weasels from  Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  There isn t a single likeable thing about the guy; even his own daughter agrees.Maybe there s some kind of redeeming quality in his past. You can t be in public service for so long and never have done anything remarkable, right? Turns out that is true with Ted Cruz. What he did as Texas Solicitor General is such remarkable douchebaggey that Cruz should never be able to live it down:Yes, that actually happened. Rather than admit the state was wrong about something as simple as a sentencing guideline, Cruz not only agreed that a man should spend more than a decade and a half behind bars, he was willing to take the mistake all the way to the Supreme Court.Ted Cruz, in short, is a pile of pure sh*t.Featured image from Gage Skidmore",News,"February 22, 2016",0,1805

" David Letterman Is Sick And Tired Of Trump’s Constant Whining, Has PERFECT Solution To Stop It","This needs to happen.David Letterman is no stranger to dealing with Donald Trump. The comedy legend humiliated Trump repeatedly as host of The Late Show. And since retiring, Letterman hasn t shied away from commenting on Trump s dumpster fire presidency when he is asked about it.During an interview with the Associated Press on Monday, Letterman made it clear that he is sick of Trump s constant whining and offered a brilliant solution. We know there s something wrong, but what I m tired of is people, daily, nightly, on all the cable news shows telling us there s something wrong,  Letterman said before calling for action. I just think we ought to direct our resources and our energies to doing something about it,  Letterman continued.  And other people have made this point: If the guy was running Dairy Queen, he d be gone. This guy couldn t work at the Gap. So why do we have to be victimized by his fecklessness, his ignorance? Indeed, Trump would have been fired long before now and definitely would not have even been hired after many of the things he has said in public. Ordinary American workers would no longer have a job if they repeated some of things Trump has said.Letterman also had a message for Trump s supporters. Letterman said he feels bad for them because they got duped into thinking Trump would be best for America. Letterman said that he wishes Trump would be the one who fixes the problems our country faces. But Trump is not the right person to get the job done. In fact, Trump should be ousted from office and placed  in a home  where he can get the medication he needs whenever he feels the need to rant uncontrollably. But it s just the behavior is insulting to Americans, whether you voted for him or not   and I feel bad for people who did vote for him because he promised them things that they really needed and one wonders if he s really going to come through. I know there s trouble in this country and we need a guy who can fix that trouble. I wish it was Trump, but it s not, so let s just stop whining about what a goon he is and figure out a way to take him aside and put him in a home. David Letterman s solution is a great idea but the only place Donald Trump should really be right now is prison.

Very wrong!PAUL MANAFORT WIRETAPPED US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump. Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, according to three sources familiar with the investigation. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.Special counsel Robert Mueller s team, which is leading the investigation into Russia s involvement in the election, has been provided details of these communications.A secret order authorized by the court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms for Ukraine s former ruling party, the sources told CNN. The surveillance was discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence, according to one of the sources.The FBI then restarted the surveillance after obtaining a new FISA warrant that extended at least into early this year.

New Jersey's Murphy echoes Sanders in Democratic bid for governor,"EDISON, N.J. (Reuters) - Phil Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs investment banker, might seem an unlikely champion of the working and middle classes. But New Jersey’s Democratic candidate for governor, who leads Republican Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno by double digits in polls, has pushed to increase taxes for corporations and the rich to pay for a plethora of populist policy proposals: tuition-free community college, increased school funding and tax credits for families. His race, one of two gubernatorial campaigns in 2017, offers an early opportunity ahead of next year’s bonanza of congressional and governor’s races for Democrats to weigh how to win in the era of Republican President Donald Trump. With Republican Governor Chris Christie’s record-low approval ratings dragging down Guadagno’s campaign, Murphy, a 60-year-old who has never held office, has pushed a decidedly liberal agenda that would put his state at the center of his party’s resistance to the president’s policies. “A lot of people assumed that after the Democratic primary was over, he would pivot more to the center - we haven’t seen that happen,” said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University in New Jersey. Guadagno, 58, portrays Murphy as an elitist millionaire - he has spent more than $16 million of his money on his run - and said he has no plan to finance his lofty goals. “I will lower your taxes, and Phil Murphy will raise them,” she said last week at the close of their final debate. Murphy’s stance reflects the national party’s leftward shift, following Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ insurgent primary campaign last year against eventual presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Like Sanders, Murphy has focused his message on a “fairer” economy, vowing to help the middle, not the moneyed, class. He highlights his working-class childhood as proof he understands financial struggle. He has backed a $15 minimum wage, proposed a public bank to provide low-interest loans to residents and promised to force “corporations, hedge funds and the wealthiest among us” to pay their fair share. “He seems like a hardworking guy who can relate to hardworking guys,” said Ed Coryell Jr., a carpenter who attended a union rally in Edison for Murphy earlier this month. “We look for people who are going to create jobs for our members.” Murphy also has woven more traditional Democratic social issues into his campaign, even as he embraces liberal causes such as legalizing marijuana. “Progressive means a lot of things, but I promise you it means at least three things,” Murphy said at a rally on Thursday with former President Barack Obama, under whom he served as ambassador to Germany from 2009 to 2013. “We will fund Planned Parenthood again,” he said. “We will sign sensible gun safety laws to keep our communities safe. And we will do something about climate change.” Most notably, Murphy has said he would extend protections for illegal immigrants, turning New Jersey into a “sanctuary state.” Guadagno seized on that issue, airing a television commercial that said Murphy “will have the backs of deranged murderers.” “Phil Murphy is even to the left of Bernie Sanders,” Guadagno campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz said. “Phil Murphy is out of touch with middle class families who want to make the state safer and more affordable.” Though he has run to the left, Murphy has strong backing from the Democratic establishment, with Obama, Clinton and former vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore all campaigning with him this month. By contrast, Guadagno, who is trailing badly in fundraising, has received minimal support from national Republican leaders. There is little question that Murphy’s liberal positions have been buoyed by the headwinds Guadagno faces, given Christie’s and Trump’s statewide unpopularity. That could mean Murphy’s campaign is not a perfect blueprint for other Democratic candidates, some analysts said. “I think a lot of people will turn to New Jersey and say, ‘Democrats have to go progressive,’” said Matthew Hale, a political science professor at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey. “But I would be very wary of Democrats trying to take a page out of the Phil Murphy playbook in any other place.” ",politicsNews,"October 23, 2017 ",1,4344
"Suspected of graft, Indonesian parliament speaker under guard in hospital","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian anti-graft investigators have put the speaker of parliament, who they have identified as a suspect in a $170 million corruption case, under armed guard in hospital after he was involved in a car accident, his lawyer said on Friday. Officers from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) tried to arrest Setya Novanto, the chairman of Golkar, Indonesia s second-largest party and partner in the ruling coalition, at his house in Jakarta late on Wednesday. But the investigators, watched by television cameras, failed to find him, sparking speculation that he had gone into hiding. The KPK is investigating state losses amounting to about $170 million linked to a national electronic identity card scheme after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million - generated by marking up procurement costs - were divided up among politicians in parliament. Novanto was named a suspect in the case again last week after he had used a controversial legal maneuver, a pre-trial motion, to get earlier charges dropped last month. He has denied wrongdoing but has repeatedly missed summonses from the KPK for questioning in recent months, saying he was ill and needed to undergo heart surgery. Late on Thursday, reports emerged that Novanto was involved in a car accident while on his way to turn himself in at KPK headquarters. Novanto s lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, said a journalist was driving the vehicle and interviewing his client at the time of the accident.  (The driver) was looking back and looking to the side, so he wasn t concentrating on what was in front of him,  Yunadi  said. Novanto was now  very ill  with head and hand injuries, Yunadi said.  He can t even get up yet. He can t talk yet, it s just his eyes   when he opens his eyes the ceiling swirls in circles.  The lawyer said armed KPK officers were guarding Novanto and had ignored requests to leave.   Novanto was taken to a second hospital on Friday for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, media reported. Novanto gained a measure of international fame in September 2015 when then U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump hailed the Indonesian politician as a  great man  during a news conference.   Do they like me in Indonesia?  Trump asked after introducing Novanto to reporters at Trump Tower.   Yes, highly,  Novanto replied. Indonesian newspapers splashed pictures across their front pages of a black sport utility vehicle that Novanto was said to have been traveling in.  It was resting against an electricity pole, and appeared to have suffered only minor damage to the front fender. Febri Diansyah, a KPK spokesman, said on Thursday the crash happened shortly after the agency had asked the national police chief and Interpol to place Novanto on a wanted list.   The KPK would liaise with doctors to see if Novanto was  fit to stand trial  and would continue its investigation, Febri told Inews TV. Yunadi has said a request for another pre-trial motion had been filed on behalf of his client.  President Joko Widodo on Friday urged Novanto, a political ally, to  follow the legal process . Previously, Widodo has backed the KPK against efforts by some members of parliament to weaken the independent agency s powers.  Vice President Jusuf Kalla, who is also a Golkar member, told reporters on Thursday Novanto should be ready to face any legal process if called upon. Indonesians widely perceive parliament as one of their country s most corrupt institutions, Transparency International says. ",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",1,3589

UK government softens immigration rules for Grenfell fire survivors,"LONDON (Reuters) - Illegal immigrants who survived a fire that killed about 80 people in a social housing block in London will be given a clear path to obtaining permanent residency in Britain, the government said on Wednesday. But critics including the local member of parliament said people whose lives were devastated by the disaster should be given indefinite leave to remain now and the government s announcement would merely add to their confusion and despair. The 24-storey Grenfell Tower, which was home to many immigrants and people from ethnic minorities, was gutted on June 14 in an inferno that started in the middle of the night and engulfed the whole building with devastating speed. The tower is located in a deprived estate within one of London s richest boroughs, and the disaster prompted a wave of soul-searching about inequality and neglect of poor communities. Some of the approximately 250 people who made it out of the building alive did not have the legal right to live in Britain and have been reluctant to make themselves known to the authorities. The government had previously said that if they came forward, those people would be given leave to remain legally in Britain for 12 months   a stance criticized as ungenerous to people whose lives had been devastated by the tragedy.  The government believes it is right to provide this specific group of survivors greater certainty over their long-term future in the UK, subject to ... the necessary security and criminality checks being met,  Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said in a statement. Under the new policy, after the initial period of 12 months, Grenfell survivors would be able to apply for further periods of limited leave to remain, building up to five years. They could then apply for permanent residency. Emma Dent Coad, a member of parliament from the opposition Labour Party who represents the area where Grenfell stands, dismissed the Conservative government s announcement as an inadequate fudge.  This is very far from the amnesty requested by volunteer groups and legal representatives,  she said.  Once again survivors of the worst ever peacetime atrocity are being short-changed by this confusing and half-hearted response.  Asked why permanent residency rights were not being offered now, a spokesman for the Home Office, or interior ministry, said the government had to act within immigration laws as they stood. Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of a public inquiry into the fire, was among those who had asked the government to reconsider the previous policy, saying some survivors did not want to take part in his investigation because of fears over their long-term immigration status. Sue Caro, a campaigner for Grenfell survivors, said Wednesday s announcement was unlikely to make any difference because people were deeply suspicious of the authorities after years of anti-immigration government rhetoric.  It won t have the desired effect,  she said.  This is an attempt to pacify all sides and it achieves nothing.  The Grenfell Tower fire prompted an outpouring of emotion from many Britons, who donated money and clothes to try and help survivors. But some people have also expressed negative views, saying that undocumented migrants should not be allowed to stay. ",worldnews,"October 11, 2017 ",1,3340
" Bundy Terrorists Dug Feces-Filled Trench On Sacred Land, Left All Kinds Of Stuff Behind","Now that the Bundy terrorists have been arrested, federal investigators have begun the painstaking task of collecting evidence of crimes committed during the 41 day-long occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.According to Oregonlive, federal officials have discovered numerous explosives, firearms and a large trench, filled with human feces.During the standoff, members of the terrorist group recorded a video of themselves riffling through boxes of Native American artifacts. As you likely remember, the terrorists claimed that the federal government was  disrespecting Native American culture and heritage,  by storing boxes of artifacts in the basement of one of the buildings on the refuge.While the video made by the militants was meant to convince the public that the group cared about the history and culture of the Paiute people, according to federal officials, the terrorists excavated a road  on or adjacent to grounds containing sensitive artifacts. They also dug a trench in the same area, and then shit in it.According to Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan Knight and Geoffrey Barrow, the FBI Evidence Response Team has found a  significant amount  of human feces located on or near these sacred grounds.In a memo released on Tuesday, officials said the FBI crime unit continues to gather evidence of additional crimes committed by the terrorists on  a particularly sensitive cultural site,  where the group also chose to set up their outdoor camp.Federal investigators released the information in response to requests by defense attorneys, who are representing the Bundy terrorists, asking the government to  preserve evidence in the case. Oregonlive also reports that,The government further will make all evidence seized in the investigation available for inspection at the FBI field office in Portland, prosecutors said.Would that include evidence from the trench of human feces the militants left behind?A better idea might be to box it all up and send it directly to the terrorists in their jail cells, in lieu of snacks.Image credit from DonkeyHotey via Flckr",News,"February 17, 2016",0,2175

The migrants were detained on several boats between Thursday and Saturday, according to a ministry statement carried on Sunday by the state news agency, APS. Algeria has so far seen relatively few attempts to cross to Europe by boat, compared to the hundreds of thousands of mostly African would-be migrants who have set off in search of prosperity or security from elsewhere along the north African coast, mostly from Libya. Most illegal crossings from Algeria take place in summer, when sailing conditions are more favorable. Neighboring Tunisia has recently seen a surge in such departures as young unemployed people seek work in Italy. Algeria s economy is also suffering as its vital energy revenues have been hit by a sharp fall in prices. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",1,958

 Remember That Time Hypocrite Trump Tweeted Obama Should Comply With Record Releases,"With Donald Trump handing out nicknames left and right, one nickname that has come to mind for him would be  Hypocrite Trump. First of all, he doesn t apparently realize that the internet can document the things you say for years after you say them. Secondly, he also doesn t seem to realize that those things that he said can and will come back to haunt him.For instance, back in 2012, Trump, on top of previously requesting President Obama s birth certificate, also demanded that he release his college transcripts.Trump tweeted out on October 30, 2012, only days before the 2012 presidential election: Why does Obama believe he shouldn t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something? Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?  Donald J.

Documents that every presidential candidate releases to show the nation financial transparency. Of course, Trump has lame excuse after lame excuse as to why he can t release them.

 Guess Who Donald Trump Blames For His Ridiculous Orange Clown Hair (VIDEO),"During another one of his seemingly made-up-as-he-goes stump speeches, Donald Trump attacked President Obama s environmental agenda while zeroing in on his own hair. Trump blamed Obama for banning Trump s brand of hairspray.You can t use hairspray, because hairspray is going to affect the ozone. I m trying to figure out, let s see, I m in my room in New York City, and I wanna put a little spray so that I can [gestures like his combing his hair]. Right? But I hear they don t want me to use hairspray. They want me to use the pump, because the other one which I really like better than going like bing bing bing. Then it comes out in big globs, like oh my God, I gotta take a shower again, my hair s all screwed up. Right? I wanna use hairspray. They say don t use hairspray, it s bad for the ozone. So I m sitting in this concealed apartment   this concealed unit, you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right? But it s sealed! It s beautiful. I don t think anything gets out. And I m not supposed to be using hairspray.Trump went on to criticize Obama for traveling around the world in Air Force One, leaving a huge  carbon footprint    not realizing, of course, that Obama as well as Al Gore, by the way, buys carbon offsets to compensate for the pollution created by their various modes of transportation. And even if he didn t, the president requires Air Force One to do his job. Likewise, the Defense Department has noted on numerous occasions the national security threat posed by the climate crisis. Would Trump blame the military for using fossil fuels in their vehicles? I certainly hope not.But back to Trump s hair. Aerosol hairspray using chlorofluorocarbons were discontinued in the 1970s, long before Obama was inaugurated. All new non-CFC aerosol hairspray is readily available in stores, but it doesn t contain any ozone-depleting chemicals any more. Meanwhile, the hole in the ozone is closing, and is expected to disappear by the end of the 21st Century. Trump doesn t know this   or if he does, he s lying to his people, assuming they re too dumb to know about something that ended in the 1970s.

OFF HER ROCKER! MAXINE WATERS: Trump Has ‘Tendency to Talk Down to People of Color’ [Video],"Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) Monday accused President Donald Trump of having a tendency to target women and people of color for his ire.Waters spoke uninterrupted for almost four minutes on MSNBC s  The Beat  about the Trump Administration s handling of the aftermath of Army Sgt. La David Johnson s death in Niger. She called on Trump and his Chief of Staff John Kelly to apologize to widow Myeshia Johnson and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D., Fla.), going on to criticize Trump s disrespect for women and minorities in general. He seems to have this tendency to talk down to people of color, to treat them with disrespect, and I think this adds to it,  Waters said.  First of all, he called [Wilson] wacky. Secondly, that he didn t back down, that he simply talked about her in a way that was not respectful I think that yes, I think this adds to the suspicion of him and the way that he thinks about minorities and black people in particular. She said Kelly was also wrong in her criticism of Wilson s 2015 speech, and she said she had the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus in saying the Trump Administration needs to do more to respect black women. All of the women of the Congressional Black Caucus have come together and we re demanding an apology,  she said.  We re sick and tired of women being undermined, dismissed, and black women, in particular, being called names. Waters also criticized Trump s overall leadership. He has the most distorted leadership of any president I ve ever known or heard about,  Waters said.  Here he had the opportunity to make the condolence call, to do it properly, to recognize this family and their grieving, and also to know the name of the soldier who had been killed. It is so unconscionable in the way that he manages his leadership,  she added.Waters also said Kelly s credibility has been damaged. General Kelly has had a good career, and to have his career basically undermined by the president of the United States because he s trying to protect the president and stand up for the president when the president did not deserve to be stood up for, now he s damaged himself,  Waters said.  He needs to call the congresswoman and apologize. ",politics,"Oct 24, 2017",0,2283

 Betsy DeVos Gets SKEWERED After Dept. Of Education Posts Embarrassingly Misspelled Tweets,"Donald Trump s Education Department is pathetic now that Betsy DeVos is in control, and this proves it.DeVos  first week as Secretary of Education has been terrible to say the least.First, she was blocked from entering a public school by protesters and ran away. Then she posted a tweet jokingly asking where the pencils are, which drew a sharp rebuke from teachers, who did not find her  joke  funny because they usually have to buy their own school supplies for their classrooms.And so, the Department of Education under DeVos  rule is off to a rough start, and it got downright embarrassing on Sunday as Americans watched in horror as the Education Department proceeded to post Twitter messages containing misspelled words.Seriously. This is the f*cking Department of Education we are talking about. Spelling should be in their wheelhouse. But because of Trump and DeVos, that skill has apparently been lost.In celebration of Black History Month, the Department of Education decided to recognize and quote W.E.B. Du Bois.

 Trump’s Plan To Repeal Obamacare Is Being DENIED By Health Care Professionals (VIDEO),"Trump promised many things during his campaign and quite a few of those ideas are falling apart already, including his plan to repeal Obamacare.Doctors and CEOs of medical facilities are not as against Obamacare as Trump wants them to be. According to Modern Healthcare, a magazine all about the healthcare industry, insurance CEOs aren t totally against change, but the majority of them are concerned a Republican president won t be able to get the uninsured rate below nine percent like Obama did.Modern Healthcare has conducted multiple surveys among CEOs and professionals in charge of large hospitals, insurance providers, and medical suppliers. They ve found that 60 percent of those who responded said that the first priority in healthcare right now should be to stopping the growth for prescription medications.Another survey showed that 86 percent of medical professionals said that Obamacare should not be repealed unless a replacement plan is in place to expand healthcare for Americans whose employers don t provide for them.Among many CEOs expressing concern for Republican proposals to create more high-deductible plans is Jim Hinton, CEO of Presbyterian Healthcare Services in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Hinton said to Modern Healthcare:  We ve floated those deductibles so high that for the average person, it is no longer insurance. That pushes the burden onto hospitals or physicians to collect what people might not have. You can see for yourself how medical professionals and advocates feel about repealing the Affordable Care Act in this video:Trump made many promises: building a wall, banning Muslims, creating jobs and repealing Obamacare, not to mention throwing Hillary Clinton in jail. Congress already shut down the first two, the third is being torn apart, and the last he already walked back (much to the chagrin of his supporters). Now we see that his plan to repeal Obamacare is strongly being defied. So what will heFeatured image via video screencapture",News,"November 22, 2016",0,2071
BREAKING: Secret Service Laptop STOLEN From Vehicle In Bronx…You Won’t Believe What’s On It!,"A laptop computer containing floor plans for Trump Tower, information about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and other national security information was stolen from a Secret Service agent s vehicle in Brooklyn, police sources told the Daily News.Authorities have been frantically searching for the laptop since it was stolen Thursday morning.Some items stolen along with the laptop   including coins and a black bag with the Secret Service insignia on it   were later recovered.But the laptop, along with other documents described as  sensitive,  were still being sought.The thief stepped out of a car, possibly an Uber, on a street in Bath Beach and stole the laptop from the agent s vehicle, which was parked in the driveway of her home.He was then seen on video walking away from the scene with a backpack.The agent reported the laptop contained floor plans for Trump Tower, evacuation protocols and information regarding the investigation of Hillary Clinton s private email server.The agent also told investigators that while nothing about the White House or foreign leaders is stored on the laptop, the information on there could compromise national security.The thief also took  sensitive  documents and the agent s access keycard, though the level of the agent s access wasn t immediately clear.

Malaysia says no decision yet on new offers to search for missing MH370,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia said on Tuesday it has received proposals from three companies offering to continue the search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which has been missing since 2014, but no decision has been made yet. MH370 vanished three years ago somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people aboard. Its disappearance has become one of the world s greatest aviation mysteries. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said proposals were received from U.S.-based seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity, Dutch firm Fugro and an unidentified Malaysian company.  We wont be deciding anything now on whether we are embarking on a new search or not,  Liow told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Kuala Lumpur.  We have to discuss with the companies. It will take some time as it s some detailed discussions,  he said. Liow was commenting on media reports from Australia that said Malaysia could resume the search as early as this week. Australia, Malaysia and China called off a A$200 million ($159.16 million), two-year search for the plane in January, amid protests from families of those onboard. Liow said the proposals would eventually be presented to the other countries in the tripartite committee - China and Australia - before a decision was taken. Representatives for Ocean Infinity have said the company would only want to be paid if the aircraft was found. The Boeing 777 aircraft disappeared on March 8, 2014, and is thought to have been diverted thousands of miles off course out over the southern Indian Ocean before crashing off the coast of Western Australia.

Six people believed injured in suspected London acid attack,"LONDON (Reuters) - Six people were believed to have been injured on Saturday after a group of males reportedly sprayed a noxious substance in a number of attacks in an area around a shopping center in east London, police said. The incident was not being treated as terror-related, a police spokesman said. The attacks occurred near the Stratford Centre, in Stratford, police said. Earlier they had said the incident took place around the bigger Westfield shopping center which is nearby.  A number of people have been reported injured at different locations - believed to be six people. We await further details,  London s Metropolitan Police said in a statement. One male was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, the statement said. The incident occurred around 8 p.m. (1900 GMT), it said. Photographs posted online showed police officers crouching over an apparent victim of the attack as they treated him. The number of acid attacks has increased in Britain in recent years, linked to robberies and gang-related violence. The government said in July it would look at tougher punishments for people who attack others using acid. ",worldnews,"September 23, 2017 ",1,1208

"White House wants healthcare vote this summer, tax reform in fall","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is hoping to kick-start its stalled legislative agenda with congressional action on healthcare reform this summer that will clear the way for lawmakers to begin work on a major tax bill after the Sept. 4 Labor Day holiday, an administration official said on Monday.     Senate Republicans will vote on their version of healthcare reform legislation before lawmakers’ August recess, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said. The House of Representatives passed a bill in May. “There’s been a lot of discussions with staff,” Short told reporters at a briefing. “I think the text is pretty far along.” Congress will then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that the effort not add to the national debt, Short stressed that the top priority would be cutting taxes. “We want it to be revenue neutral, and we are still supportive of tax reform, but I am also saying to you that what we believe is most important to get the economy going is the tax cuts,” he said.  President Donald Trump will meet with the Republican leaders of the House and the Senate, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday to discuss the path forward for his agenda, said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. Trump has pressed for quicker action in Congress, but his administration has also been hampered by investigations into alleged ties between Trump’s election campaign and Russia. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. But, the proposal has been short on details — including the cost of the tax cuts and what loopholes would be closed.      The healthcare bill passed by the House could result in 23 million people losing insurance, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, a conclusion that Republicans were quick to challenge. The bill would also reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis. Short said he believed that the Senate healthcare bill would be “similar” to the House package.  Senator John Cornyn, the No.2 Republican in the Senate, said Monday evening he thought there would be a vote on a healthcare bill in the Senate in July. Short also said the White House expects for Congress to raise the government’s borrowing authority, also known as the debt limit, before the August recess. ",politicsNews,"June 6, 2017 ",1,2507
FORMER “BAYWATCH” STAR Tries To Flirt Her Way Past Secret Service,"Former  Baywatch  star Pamela Anderson tried to use her charms to get past the Secret Service to meet with Vice President Mike Pence. She wanted to speak with Pence about a pardon for Julian Assange of Wikileaks. Anderson has been connected to Assange romantically and reportedly visits him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. She s also become more politically active in recent years because of her awareness of Assange s plight.Page Six reports:Spies tell Page Six that Anderson was in Manhattan filming a PSA at the JW Marriott Essex House when she learned that Pence was at the same address. The blond bombshell has said that she  loves  WikiLeaks founder Assange and visits him every two weeks in his  cramped  room at London s Ecuadorian embassy, where he s staying in order to evade extradition.According to onlookers, Anderson  marched straight up to the Secret Service and asked to see Pence. A witness said:  The Secret Service agent practically swooned and fainted when she walked up to him and started pressing her finger on his badge. Pam said,  I d like to meet the vice president.  But, the source added,  The agent did get it together enough to politely refuse, saying the vice president was busy. Pamela Anderson s attempt to woo the Secret Service was unsuccessful.When we reached activist Anderson for comment, she confirmed to Page Six:  I wanted to thank [Pence] for supporting protection of sources for journalists. He is heralded for co-sponsoring proposals for a  federal shield law,  which I deeply admire. This action would have allowed journalists to keep confidential sources secret   even if the government requested them.  She added,  I really wanted to mention this   it is a topic close to my heart. Julian Assange deserves a pardon, and I thought I might be able to help. Julian is a hero to most of the world s youth and free-minded thinking people.

[VIDEO] CARLY TAKES ON THE VIEW Hacks Only Days After Saying She Has A “Demented Face” And A “Halloween Mask”,"So, if the hosts on this show are just  comedians,  does that mean the low information voters who follow them will stop taking these hacks so seriously? Friday on ABC s  The View,  Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina fought toe to toe with the co-hosts over their comments disparaging her face as demented  and a  Halloween Mask. After small talk, Whoopi Goldberg brought up the subject saying,  How about humor? I m going the bring it up because there are going to be lots of comics saying lots of things. I wondered, because we saw some of the that you were a little upset with us about a comic comment that was made. And so, how will you steel your skin? How will you get a thicker skin to accept some of the humorous things that will be said about you? Fiorina said,  Well, hey, if you meant your comment about my face being demented and a Halloween mask as humorous, so be it. I guess you misinterpreted Donald Trump s questions. I have a real thick skin. Joy Behar said,  I defended you against Donald Trump s comment. He s running for president of the United States and he was making a nasty comment about your looks. I took him on. On this show, but, we are comedians here. I make fun of Hillary s pantsuits. Hillary s husband s sex life. Rep. John Boehner s tan. Who else? I don t understand why any politician is exempt from my jokes. Here s the clip from Carly s awesome interview:Fiorina answered,  You know what, Joy. You know what, Joy? You can say whatever you want. You always have. You always will. I m not going to stop that. And don t worry, I have skin plenty thick enough to the take whatever people throw at me. I m making a different point. The different point is this. I think that there are real issues in this nation that we ought to be able to discuss in a fact-based, civil fashion. Michelle Collins said,  I want to add that the demented comment was a poor choice of words. It was responding to something you said during the debates. That people were telling you the smile more. To me, it felt like it was not your natural state of mind. It was not on your looks, it was on your expression. It felt like you were being told to smile more. I m wondering, is that difficult for you? Do you have people coaching you to act or be a different way? Will that help you win the election? Fiorina shot back,  First of all, I don t have people coaching me to act a different way or be a different way. There s a time to smile and a time to be serious. When you re talking about burying a child, it s not time to smile. There are serous issues facing the nation. Goldberg said,  We had you here. I thought we were pretty respectful. I have to tell you, having watched some of the press that you have garnered based on this fake feud with  The View,  I m a little taken aback. Because you kind of said that that somehow liberal women are that we re made uncomfortable by conservative women. We were not uncomfortable with you. Did you think we were uncomfortable with you when you were on? Fiorina said,  First of all, Whoopi. I enjoyed being on the show. The first time. and I m enjoying being on the show the second time. And I think  The View  garnered a lot of publicity over the feud as well. I think that s why we re on. Goldberg said,   We haven t put out any ads or anything. Fiorina said,  I haven t put out any ads either, Whoopi. Via: Breitbart News ",politics,"Nov 6, 2015",0,3533
 Now Jared Kushner’s Uncle Is Also Using Trump To Sell Real Estate In China,"It wasn t even a month ago that a company run by the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President Donald Trump, were conducting a presentation in a Beijing ballroom, where Kushner s sister was pitching a real estate project to wealthy Chinese investors that would make it easier to get US visas. Now it has emerged that another relative of Kushner is using his ties to the president in the hope of securing foreign property investors.The KRE Group, a real estate company run by Jared s uncle, Murray Kushner, pitched a Jersey City apartment project to Chinese investors, using images of Donald and Ivanka Trump, as well as Jared, in their presentation in an attempt to seal the deal.  Work hand-in-hand with Trump son-in-law Kushner,  said the pitch, telling attendees that if they invested $500,000, they could qualify for a U.S. resident visa through a program known as EB-5.The EB-5 visa allows rich foreigners to immigrate to the USA if they are willing to invest large amounts of money into US job-creating projects.Although neither KRE or Murray Kushner have officially commented on the presentation, one partner in the project, Dave Barry, pinned the blame on the Chinese marketing company they used, Noah Visa. However, Eric Yuan, manager and part owner of Noah Visa, didn t initially agree with Barry s side of the story, first denying the inclusion of the pictures of the Trumps and Kushner. When it became apparent that screenshots were available from the presentation, Yuan changed his tune and also tried to pass the blame. The media did that to push hot topics; we didn t do it,  he said in a phone conversation.  Jared has nothing to do with the project. Yuan also stated that Noah Visa no longer promotes the property, located at 235 Grand Street, and claimed that a further presentation scheduled for May 13 was canceled due to lack of interest. When informed of what Dave Barry had said, that the subcontract was ended because the promotion was misleading, Yuan simply hung up the phone.And to think that many republican voters said they wanted a businessman in the White House.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 1, 2017",0,2228

 Pat Robertson Is Having A Total Meltdown And It’s All Thanks To Rachel Maddow,"MSNBC s Rachel Maddow has twisted Pat Robertson of the  700 Club  in a knot over her show s ratings which are beating the snot out of Fox News. But just before that, Robertson waded into conspiracy theory territory (while denying that he s a conspiracy theorist) in order to defend Fox News host Eric Bolling over recent allegations that he sent lewd photos to several female colleagues. Then he had a meltdown over Maddow s show, which has almost tripled in ratings, from 849,000 nightly viewers in 2014 to more than 2.3 million in June.The MSNBC host is now the most popular personality in prime-time cable news   a title that has been claimed by Fox News TV hosts since 2001. Well, that was too much for Robertson to handle so he launched into a rant about her ratings (as one does while hosting a religious show). MSNBC is now winning the demographic ratings against Fox, they ve got the demos, which is the 18 to 49 young people, isn t that amazing,  he said. MSNBC, really?  co-host Terry Meeuwsen said in disbelief. Rachel Maddow of all people is number one, but Fox is self-imposed wounds,  said Robertson, who then said that he  applauds Fox News  because  they re doing a great job. Those lawyers better get out of the picture and let the programmers run that network,  Robertson said.Last month, Trump was interviewed by Roberston in which he spoke of repealing Obamacare, foreign policy and, of course, Hillary Clinton. Trump sucked up the airwaves with the right wing Christian leader to take the opportunity to lie without being called out on the show.  But, Pat Roberston is a conspiracy theorist and so is the former reality show star, so hopefully, they went out to eat afterward at Comet Ping Pong, the focus of a debunked right wing conspiracy theorist, to check out the basement together (there is no basement at the pizzeria).Rachel Maddow has been all over the Trump-Russia scandal, increasing her viewership by a hefty percentage.Read more:Image via screen capture.

" Trump’s Favorability Rating Hits Historic, Record Low","Americans are waking up. After being promised Trump would change his tune once elected, the people have been shown that he will not, in any sense of the word, change his tune.He s still the same loud, obnoxious, shady, thin-skinned demagogue he was when he announced his candidacy.It s because of this (and other damning information) that the American people are giving him low approval ratings, and rightly so. In fact, his approval ratings have hit a record and historic low for any incoming president.A new Gallup Poll shows that 55 percent of Americans hold a negative view of Trump, while 40 percent have a favorable view.According to the poll:President-elect Donald Trump approaches Inauguration Day with a significantly lower favorable rating than his three immediate predecessors received when they were presidents-elect. Trump s 40% favorable rating is roughly half of what Barack Obama enjoyed before his inauguration in 2009 (78%) and is much lower than the pre-inaugural ratings for George W. Bush (62%) and Bill Clinton (66%)   Of the four most recent incoming presidents, Trump is the only president-elect whose unfavorable rating outweighs his favorable score.The best part lies within his own party: he has a lower approval rating from Republicans than any other GOP president. While George Bush nabbed 97 percent approval among the GOP, Trump only has 82 percent.Like Trump, Mike Pence and Melania Trump also face historic low approval ratings for the vice presidency and first lady respectively.America really hates Donald Trump and his ilk. That s a start.Congratulations, America, you elected a universally hated fascist who picks fights with John Lewis instead of Vladimir Putin.Gallup summed up what will be the state of the union for the next few months:But he enters office with a significantly more negative image than prior presidents-elect have had and with a less positive image even among those who identify with his own party. The president-elect s general unpopularity is an unprecedented hurdle, whose impact on his ability to govern remains to be seen.Trump was illegitimately elected, lost the popular vote, and is hated by the American people. He has absolutely no mandate, no legitimacy, no room to bargain. The honeymoon is officially over.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"January 16, 2017",0,2375
U.S. Air Force asks industry for proposals to replace nuclear missiles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force asked industry on Friday for proposals to replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and the nuclear cruise missile as the military moves ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. The Air Force said in a statement it expected to award up to two contracts for a new ICBM weapons system, or ground-based strategic deterrent, sometime next summer or fall. It also expected to award up to two contracts in the same time frame for a new nuclear cruise missile, or long-range standoff weapon. Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force is expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade as the United States works to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimate the cost of modernization at $1 trillion over 30 years. The new ICBM system would be a follow-on to the Minuteman missile, whose launch systems and physical infrastructure first became operational in the mid-1960s. The system has been upgraded over the years, but much of the infrastructure is original, the Air Force said. The most recent versions of the Minuteman III date from the late 1990s and early 2000s and had an intended 20-year life span, the Air Force said. The missile will “face increased operational and sustainment challenges until it can be replaced,” it said. “This request for proposals is the next step to ensuring the nation’s ICBM leg of the nuclear triad remains safe, secure and effective,” said Major General Scott Jansson, who leads the Air Force program office for strategic systems. Opponents of replacing the nuclear cruise missile have argued that its missions could be handled by other legs of the triad. Others say it is an unnecessary expense at a time of shrinking budgets and smaller deployed nuclear arsenals. The military insists the new cruise missile is needed to enable older bombers to deliver nuclear weapons to targets whose air space is heavily defended and difficult to reach with gravity bombs.

Republican U.S. Senator Corker will not seek re-election next year,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bob Corker, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Tuesday he will not run for re-election, a blow to a party already struggling to balance divisions between mainstream and more populist wings. A former mayor of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and a businessman, Corker, 65, had said when he was elected that he could not imagine serving more than two Senate terms. He said early this month he had not decided whether he would seek a third next year. An establishment Republican, Corker has been criticized from the right, and a conservative activist had already announced a primary challenge. But he was expected to keep the seat, and had amassed a $7.5 million campaign war chest. Corker has ruled out running for governor of Tennessee. “I have no idea what I’m going to do. No idea whatsoever,” Corker said in an interview. But he said he was not leaving out of frustration over deep party divides that have often paralyzed Congress. Corker announced his retirement on the day of the failure of the latest Republican effort to repeal former Democratic President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. “I am not going to be one of the people who leaves here badmouthing what is one of the greatest privileges of one’s life,” Corker said. “I know I’ll miss this place,” he said. He said he realized he was ready to retire on Aug. 24 during a factory groundbreaking in Clarksville, Tennessee, and almost announced his decision at least twice before Tuesday. Corker said that he made his announcement now to allow a strong candidate time to enter the Senate race. Corker is the first senator to announce his retirement ahead of the 2018 mid-term elections, when one-third of the 100-seat chamber will be up for grabs. Tennessee is a solidly Republican state and the party, which currently holds a 52-seat majority in the Senate, is favored to keep his seat. In his official announcement, Corker said that “after much thought, consideration and family discussion” over the past year, he and his wife Elizabeth “have decided that I will leave the United States Senate when my term expires at the end of 2018.” Corker has been a close national security adviser to President Donald Trump and was on the short list last year to be both his vice president and Secretary of State. But he has also clashed with the White House. In August, after Trump’s much-criticized reaction to violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia, Corker told reporters in his home state Tennessee that Trump had not been able to demonstrate the “stability” or competence that he needed to be successful as president. Trump struck back on Twitter, where he said Corker’s statements were “strange” considering that he is “constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in ‘18.” “Tennessee not happy!” Trump tweeted. After the exchange, the two men had an hour-long meeting at the White House this month that Corker has described as a wide-ranging and friendly discussion. Corker will remain chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee until he leaves in January 2019. He said he wanted the panel to address issues including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s State Department reorganization, food aid reform, and the fight against human trafficking and modern slavery. Corker said the committee would address the international nuclear agreement with Iran, as Trump faces a mid-October deadline for deciding whether to certify that Tehran is complying with that pact. That decision could force Congress to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Corker would not say whether Trump had decided to certify or not. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him as foreign relations chairman if Republicans maintain their Senate majority. Jim Risch is the next Republican in line, but Marco Rubio, one of Trump’s rivals last year for the presidential nomination, is also considered a contender. Corker is known for working with Democrats on a range of issues, from foreign relations to immigration and Obama’s auto industry bailout.  His statement alluded to his desire to continue to work “thoughtfully and independently” in the next 15 months, which could signal more conflicts with Trump.

"Kenya president snubs vote crisis meeting, presses on with campaign","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta snubbed a crisis meeting called by the top election official for Thursday, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning for next week s presidential vote re-run. The first presidential vote in August, which Kenyatta won by 1.4 million votes, was annulled by the Supreme Court over procedural irregularities.  The re-run is set for Oct. 26 but opposition leader Raila Odinga has pulled out, alleging a failure to improve oversight of the election, casting doubt on how the vote will proceed. Election board chairman Wafula Chebukati, in a stark message to political leaders on Wednesday, said he could not guarantee a credible vote under present conditions, and demanded Kenyatta and Odinga meet him for talks. The board, known as the IEBC, set the meeting for 1130 GMT in Nairobi but then said it had been postponed to an unspecified date and time. Chebukati later tweeted that he had met Odinga and was  looking forward  to meeting Kenyatta, though it was not clear if the president intended to respond to his call. Opposition demonstrations, which have led to confrontations between police and protesters, and divisive rhetoric by politicians have stoked uncertainty in Kenya, East Africa s largest economy and a stable Western ally in a chaotic region. Speaking at a campaign rally in the western town of Saboti late on Wednesday, Kenyatta said the priority was for Kenyans to go to the polls on the set date.  We are not interested in telling the IEBC what to do. We want them to prepare so Kenyans can vote on the 26th,  he said. However, Odinga, whose call for mass protests on election day has sparked fears that the crisis could turn violent, called for serious talks on the impasse after meeting Chebukati.  Odinga said his withdrawal should force the commission to start a fresh 90-day electoral cycle, including fresh candidate nominations. The election board says the vote will go ahead.  Chebukati s call for a meeting with the candidates followed the flight of one IEBC commissioner to New York. Roselyn Akombe said she had fled due to threats and said the planned election would amount to a mockery of democracy. The ruling Jubilee party filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Thursday alleging opposition politicians were in contempt of court for obstructing a re-run by withdrawing from the race and by ordering supporters to continue protests including during trainings of election staff in western Kenya.  The current political climate indeed strikingly resembles the period prior to 2007-2008 post-election violence,  said Francis Ole Kaparo, chair of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, a government body in charge of preventing hate speech. Following the disputed 2007 poll, more than 1,200 Kenyans were killed. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1,2875

 WATCH Trevor Noah’s Takedown Of Iowa GOP’s Chilling Proposal To Let Kids Have Guns,"The Daily Show, be it under the hosting of Jon Stewart or Trevor Noah, has never been subtle about its disdain for the GOP s idiocy. However, Tuesday night s episode was more chilling than almost any we ve ever seen, since it addressed a terrifying bill that is being proposed by House Republicans in Iowa   a bill that would let children have guns. Host Trevor Noah was understandably incredulous at the fact that this is even a thing. First, Noah addressed the fact that kids can already use hunting rifles, but not handguns, with adult supervision. He began by comparing this lunacy to the notorious hatred between Justin Beiber fans ( Beliebers ) and New Direction fans ( Directioners ): Beliebers vs. Directoners just got a whole lot more interesting. Noah then turned his attentions to kids who like to hunt: Some kids do like hunting. It s those kids who only like the first five minutes of Bambi. But then, things got downright scary, when Noah played a clip from a news station that detailed the intentions of Nathan Gibson, a gun nut who has been letting his kids use handguns since they were 5, even though it is illegal. He s now trying to make his illegal and dangerous actions with his own children the law of the land in the state of Iowa. Just to get this straight: Some guy picked up the phone and called a lawmaker and said  Hey, uh, my kids need guns.  And they were like,  Done!  And every day in America there s parents calling lawmakers saying,  Hey, my kids died because of guns.  And they re like,  Uhh, can you hold? Noah went on to described the absurdity of all of this in terms even a fool could understand (though I doubt the fools falling in line behind this dangerous nonsense will care). He began by asking,  Do you know what children are?  and showed clips of crying, tantrum-throwing kids. Who watches that and says,  Uh, I like that, but it s missing something.  After that, the clip was repeated, this time with gunfire. He ended on a chilling note: Oh, and by the way, that was under adult supervision. You do realize that. That kid was doing that under adult supervision. I love that the adult was like,  I m just gonna video this. Watch the video below:And this is why we should not allow gun nuts to make laws. They truly are insane. Thank you, Trevor Noah, for telling it like it is. Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"March 2, 2016",0,2462

Migrant-smuggling gang caught in Bulgaria,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgarian authorities have smashed a gang suspected of smuggling migrants into Western Europe, prosecutors said in a statement on Wednesday. Eight people, including two Pakistanis, were charged with smuggling offences after they transported migrants, mainly Pakistanis, Afghans and Iraqis, from Turkey into Romania and then to Hungary and Austria, the statement said. Six members of the gang were detained following a coordinated operation in Sofia and the Danube towns of Vidin and Lom on Tuesday. The migrants had paid between 4,000 euros ($4,700) and 6,000 euros each, the prosecutors said. Bulgaria has built a fence on its border with Turkey and has bolstered its border controls to prevent inflows of illegal migrants.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1,785
Trump administration sides against unions in high court fees case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday said it would oppose public sector unions in a major case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, reversing the view taken by the Obama administration in an identical dispute. The Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief against the unions in a case brought by a non-union government employee in Illinois that targets fees his state and many others compel such workers to pay to unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other organized labor activities. He is arguing that such fees violate the free speech rights of non-union members. The high court heard a similar challenge out of California in January 2016 and had appeared headed toward ruling the fees unconstitutional. But conservative justice Antonin Scalia died a month later and the short-handed court ended up with a 4-4 split in April 2016 that left the law intact but set no nationwide precedent. In that case, the Obama administration filed a brief backing the unions. Addressing the change of position, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in the court filing that after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the new case “the government reconsidered the question and reached the opposite conclusion.” The Trump administration has already adopted opposing positions to those taken by the Obama administration in other major cases pending at the Supreme Court, including another labor case on whether employers should be able to require workers to sign contracts that prevent them from making class action claims. The administration also reversed an Obama administration stance by supporting Ohio in its bid to revive a state policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots.

"Kurdish leader departs, leaving nephew faced with reconciliation","ERBIL Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish President Masoud Barzani departed office on Wednesday, leaving his nephew to reconcile with the central government in Baghdad, with regional neighbors and with rival Kurdish parties after a failed referendum on independence. Nechirvan Barzani, who has served alongside his uncle as prime minister, will now be the main authority figure in the executive of the Kurdish autonomous region, following Masoud Barzani s departure as president, Kurdish officials said.  The prime minister will be the key person during this transitional period,  said Hoshyar Zebari, a former Iraqi foreign minister, now advisor to the Kurdish government and senior member of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).  The elder Barzani, a 71-year-old veteran guerrilla leader, had run the Kurdish autonomous region with a firm hand since 2005, during which it prospered while the rest of Iraq was mired in civil war. But he announced his resignation on Sunday, effective on Nov. 1, after a Sept. 25 referendum on independence backfired, prompting the central government to send troops to recapture territory held by the Kurds outside their autonomous region. The referendum and government backlash have also revealed deep divisions among the Kurds themselves. During his resignation speech, Masoud Barzani accused his political rivals of  high treason  for yielding territory without a fight. His nephew Nechirvan, 51, who has served as prime minister for all but three years since 2006, is seen in Kurdish politics as a less polarising figure, having warmer relations than his uncle with rival Kurdish parties. He also has a close working relationship with Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan, who has backed Baghdad in the central government s dispute with the Kurds since the referendum. The Kurdish regional parliament voted on Sunday to divide the president s powers among parliament, the judiciary and the cabinet, until parliamentary and presidential elections are next held. The elections were originally scheduled for Nov. 1 but postponed last month until next year. Before the referendum, Barzani s son Masrour was seen as his likely successor, but he has been damaged by his backing of the secession vote, which soured relationships with Baghdad and regional powers who opposed it. On Monday, the United States commended Masoud Barzani for stepping down and said it would actively engage with Nechirvan Barzani and his deputy, Qubad Talabani, a member of the rival political faction with whom he maintains a good relationship. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also spoke with Nechirvan Barzani on Monday to encourage dialogue with Baghdad. He also met with met with the French and Germany ambassadors to Iraq, Bruno Aubert and Cyrill Nunn, on Tuesday. As prime minister, Nechirvan Barzani has been central to brokering the semi-autonomous region s oil dealings, now in jeopardy following Iraq s recapture of disputed territories on Oct. 16, including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Despite no longer being president, Masoud Barzani will not be retreating from public life, government officials said.  In his televised address on Sunday announcing the end of his presidency, Barzani said that he would remain a Peshmerga, or Kurdish fighter, and will continue to battle for his people s lifelong dream of independence. He will also remain head of the ruling party and will still sit on the High Political Council, a non-governmental body which emerged after the referendum. Kurdish politics have been dominated for decades by the KDP, led by three generations of the Barzani family, and its main rivals the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), led by the family of Jalal Talabani, who died in October. The two parties fought a civil war against each other in the 1990s, but maintained an outward appearance of unity after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, with Jalal Talabani serving as Iraq s ceremonial president in Baghdad from 2005-2014 while Masoud Barzani ran the Kurdish autonomous region.

"White House downplays Charlottesville comments from Tillerson, Cohn","ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday downplayed talk of division among President Donald Trump’s advisers after Secretary of State Tillerson and economic adviser Gary Cohn appeared to criticize Trump for his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. In an interview on Fox News Sunday over the weekend, Tillerson said “the president speaks for himself” when asked about Trump’s values.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday that senior administration officials were not distancing themselves from the president despite the comments from Tillerson and Cohn. She said Trump’s relationship with Tillerson was “very strong” and that Cohn was committed to working on tax reform. “I think that ... at moments you have people that disagree, I think that’s a healthy thing,” she told reporters on Air Force One.

 Bernie Sanders Consoles Sister Of Police Violence Victim In Emotional Backstage Discussion (VIDEO),"On April 11th, before he spoke at his rally in Albany, New York, Bernie Sanders met with local Black Lives Matter activists.  The local police department has a long history of corruption and abuse. In April 2015, Albany Police Officers killed unarmed 39-year-old Dontay Ivy. While he was walking home from an ATM they tasered him and beat him to death with police batons. Mr. Ivy was mentally ill. In the video, his aunt takes Bernie Sanders through what happened. No officers were charged in the death and a grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing because of a lack of witnesses. Allegedly the dash cams in the patrol cars were turned off. I worried about my brother all the time. I thought outside elements would hurt him. But the people who were supposed to protect him, they re the ones who hurt him,  Dontay Ivy s sister, Johnson, told Senator Sanders in tears.Bernie Sanders has lead the call for police reform in the Democratic Primaries. He was the only candidate who called for a Department of Justice investigation in December 2015 after it was announced there would be no indictment of the police officers involved. He was the only candidate who called for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign over his administration s overt cover up of unarmed teenager LaQuan MacDonald s death. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who has proposed that the Department of Justice investigates every death caused by police involvement or in police custody so police departments can t cover up the incidents or protect their own from being held accountable for their actions. I got the racial profiling issues, I got it. And I got the need for police reform. What we should be doing is training police officers to deal with issues, although this doesn t seem to be a terribly difficult issue, this is not like somebody with a weapon or anything. It s a guy walking down the street, right? Going home. It s not exactly a major crime,  Bernie Sanders told the group backstage. What we don t have yet is a culture in this country that says to the police departments that lethal force, in this case using a Taser several times is a last resort, not a first resort, right? Clearly, in this particular case, it can be dealt with in a hundred different ways.

Peace prospects dead if Trump moves U.S. embassy to Jerusalem: Palestinian aide,"JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Palestinian official warned on Friday that implementation of Donald Trump’s pledge to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem would destroy any prospects for peace with Israel, even as a spokesman for the U.S. President-elect said he remained committed to the move. Saeb Erekat, secretary-general of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, issued the grim prediction just a day after Trump announced his decision to nominate as ambassador to Israel David Friedman, a pro-Israel hardliner who supports continued building of Jewish settlements and shifting the embassy from Tel Aviv. Speaking to foreign journalists, Erekat said Jerusalem was a final-status issue to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians, who also want it as the capital of a future independent state. Successive U.S. administrations have avoided formally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. If Trump makes good on his campaign promise, it would up-end decades of U.S. policy, enrage the Muslim world and draw international condemnation. Jerusalem is home to sites sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians. “No one should take any decisions which may preempt or prejudge (negotiations) because this will be the destruction of the peace process as a whole,” Erekat said, according to a transcript provided by an aide. The last U.S.-backed talks on statehood collapsed in 2014. He further warned of dire consequences if Israel annexes settlements built on occupied land. Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer and close friend of Trump who has no diplomatic experience, has advocated the idea of Israel annexing the West Bank, as it did with Arab East Jerusalem following its capture in the 1967 Middle East war in a move not recognized internationally. Erekat said he would like to look Trump and Friedman in the eye and tell them “if you were to take these steps of moving the embassy and annexing settlements in the West Bank, you are sending this region to more chaos, lawlessness and extremism.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a fractious relationship with President Barack Obama, was satisfied with Friedman’s appointment, according to the Israeli website Ynet, and several members of his right-wing government welcomed the choice. Liberal Jewish-American groups have raised objections over positions he has stated in writings and press interviews, which they see as a rejection of a two-state solution, a longtime bedrock of U.S. Middle East policy, and alignment with Israel’s far right. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the president-elect “remains firmly committed” to relocating the embassy but that it was “premature” to present a timetable for such a move. U.S.-based analysts said that while Friedman’s appointment could signal a break with longstanding U.S. policy as well as  Obama’s sometimes tough approach to ally Israel, U.S. ambassadors typically do not drive Middle East policy and it was still unclear how far Trump would be prepared to go. Friedman, who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, declined to answer questions when contracted by Reuters. “I’ll do that at some point, but I’m not providing any comments just yet,” he said. In Thursday’s announcement, Friedman said he looked forward to doing the job “from the U.S. embassy in Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem.” “Appointing David Friedman ... is a positive declaration of intent,” Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked tweeted. “David is a true friend of Israel.” Friedman has also called liberal Jewish Americans supporting a two-state solution “worse than kapos,” a reference to Jewish prisoners in World War Two concentration camps assigned by Nazi guards to supervise fellow inmates. J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group, told supporters  Friedman’s appointment was “unacceptable” and it would fight to persuade U.S. senators not to confirm his nomination.

U.S. Congress urged to require Chinese journalists to register as agents,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A report to the U.S. Congress released on Wednesday accused Chinese state media entities of involvement in spying and propaganda and said their staff in the United States should be required to register as foreign agents. The annual report of the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission said that while China had tightened restrictions on domestic and foreign media, Chinese state media had rapidly expanded overseas. The commission, created by Congress in 2000 to monitor national security implications of U.S.-China trade relations, said China’s state media expansion was part of a broader effort to exert greater control over how China is depicted globally, as well as to gather information. The report highlighted the rapid growth of the Xinhua news agency and noted that it had offices at the United Nations in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and San Francisco. “Xinhua serves some of the functions of an intelligence agency by gathering information and producing classified reports for the Chinese leadership on both domestic and international events,” the report said. It quoted testimony to the commission by the U.S. Government-funded rights organization, Freedom House, as saying it was a “loophole” that individuals working for Xinhua and China’s People’s Daily newspaper were not covered by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA, first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War Two  to combat German propaganda efforts, requires foreign governments, political parties and lobbyists they hire in the United States to register with the Department of Justice.  The China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by China’s government and ruling Communist Party, is already registered under FARA but only its top executives are required to individually disclose working for the publication. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is working to overhaul FARA after Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, and a business associate were indicted for failing to register under the law.  The reform, backed by powerful Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, could provide an opportunity for Congress to act on the commission recommendations.  On Monday, the Kremlin-backed television station RT America registered under FARA after U.S. intelligence agencies in a report in January called it a “state-run propaganda machine” that contributed to the Kremlin’s campaign to interfere with last year’s U.S. presidential election. Under the act, RT will be required to disclose financial information. Moscow has said it views the action against RT as an unfriendly act. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2017 ",1,2737

 Bush Attorney General: Obama ‘Has An Obligation’ To Fill Scalia’s Seat (VIDEO),"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is still dead and the Republican Party is still pledging to block any nominee for the vacancy that President Obama puts forth. According to right-wingers like Ted Cruz, the president doesn t have the  right  to elect a new justice because in the distorted minds of the imbeciles in the GOP the American people only elect Democratic presidents for three years, not the four Republicans get. However, not everyone on the crazy side of the aisle believes this nonsense, actually a very high-ranking member of the Bush Administration, former-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, thinks that it is President Obama s  obligation  to appoint someone to the court.On Monday, AG Gonzales appeared on CNN s New Day to discuss the  controversy  surrounding the vacancy on the highest court in the country: I know there s a big debate going on right now about whether or not Obama should nominate someone. From my perspective having worked at the White House and the Dept. of Justice, there s just no question in my mind that as president of the United States, you have an obligation to fill a vacancy. I suspect President Obama is going to do his job,  he continued.  And after he does his job and nominating a hopefully qualified individual, the Senate will do its job eventually on its own calendar. The president absolutely has an obligation to fill the court, it is one of his most important duties as president. Of course, I don t really expect Ted Cruz and his buddies to understand anything about  duties,  after all, these are the imbeciles that refused to do their jobs and shut the government down in 2013.

 WATCH: New ‘Birdie’ Sanders Ad Celebrates RESOUNDING Weekend Victories,"Bernie Sanders is on fire, especially after this weekend s resounding victories in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, which  have propelled the Democratic presidential hopeful s campaign to unprecedented momentum as the Democratic primary moves forward. Speaking in front of a crowd of thousands in Wisconsin on Saturday, Sanders said:  Let me begin by thanking the people of Alaska for giving us a resounding victory tonight. We are making significant inroads in Secretary Clinton s lead and we have with your support coming here to Wisconsin, we have a path toward victory. Alright, are you ready for a news alert? We just won the state of Washington. The crowd then erupted. Now, there s a new ad that celebrates those weekend victories with Bernie dancing to the tune of the song The bird is the word, which plays off of the bird that landed on a podium earlier in the week while Sanders was speaking in Portland, Oregon, hence the new nickname Birdie Sanders. The ad highlights the landslide victories in Washington and Alaska on Saturday, and Idaho and Utah earlier in the week.The victories are quite impressive because of the sheer number of voters who overwhelmingly supported Sanders. In Idaho, he won with 78% of the vote. While in Utah he received 79%, Alaska 81%, Washington 72%, and Hawaii with 70%.The Sanders  campaign definitely seems to be gaining momentum towards the possibility getting the Democratic nomination.

Former Kentucky state lawmaker sentenced to seven years for bribery,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - A former Kentucky lawmaker received a seven-year prison sentence on Thursday for bribing an inspector to overlook violations at his coal mining companies, his attorney said. Former state Representative W. Keith Hall, 56, who was convicted in federal court in June 2015 of paying $46,000 over a five-year period to former mining inspector Kelly Shortridge, was also fined $25,000, said his attorney, Brent Caldwell.  Prosecutors said at Hall’s trial in Lexington that most of the funds were funneled from Hall’s companies to a shell company the two men created in the name of Shortridge’s wife. Shortridge reached a plea agreement and testified against Hall. He is slated to start his 24-month sentence next week. According to court documents, sentencing guidelines for Hall called for more than eight years in prison. His attorneys argued a sentence closer to the minimum 6-1/2 years was more appropriate. Caldwell said on Thursday an appeal was still possible, adding his client disagreed with the verdict. Hall, a Democrat, served 14 years in the Kentucky General Assembly before losing a primary election in May 2014. His indictment came five months later. His companies listed in the indictment included Beech Creek Coal Co, LLC & HEI Services LLC. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1,1348
U.S. rescinds Obama plan for some undocumented parents,"(Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly signed a memorandum on Thursday rescinding an Obama-era plan to spare some illegal immigrant parents of children who are lawful permanent residents from being deported, the department said in a statement. The program, which was announced by President Barack Obama in 2014, never took effect because it was blocked in federal court.  Obama had hoped that overhauling the U.S. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy.    However, President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. The plan unveiled by Obama intended to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. However, it was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued Obama had overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress.  A federal appeals court blocked the program, and the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand in a 4-4 split decision last year. Kelly said in a statement on Thursday he was rescinding the initiative, known as DAPA, because “there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy.” An earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offers some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children the chance to attend school and to work.  Trump has previously said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA, but no formal changes have been announced. “They shouldn’t be very worried,” Trump said of DACA recipients in a January ABC News interview. “I do have a big heart.” ",politicsNews,"June 16, 2017 ",1,2026

Kenyan opposition chief to focus on corruption in election re-run,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga says he will make the mismanagement of last month s annulled presidential vote the focus of his new election campaign, linking it to a series of political scandals.  The Supreme Court last week nullified the Aug. 8 election, ruling that incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta s win by 1.4 million votes was invalid due to flaws in the tallying process.   Right now, we are basically dealing with the rigging of elections, which is basically an extension of corruption,  Odinga told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, repeating his allegation, rejected by the court, that Kenyatta had deliberately manipulated the vote.  Odinga has threatened to boycott the re-run unless a series of demands are met.  The court ruling sent shockwaves through Kenya, East Africa s richest country per capita and a relatively stable ally of the West in a region beset by conflict.  Although it caused political uncertainty, many hope it will eventually reduce the chance of political violence by rebuilding trust in Kenya s battered public institutions.  The election commission set the re-run for Oct. 17, but Odinga reiterated his stance that he would not take part unless some electoral officials were fired and the opposition were given access to voting data that they say will prove their allegation of deliberate rigging. The board has said different staff will be in charge of the re-run, but has not opened up the election records for scrutiny or announced any disciplinary measures.   This election shows that Jubilee (the ruling party) have taken corruption to the stratosphere in our country ... it is very regrettable, it is actually shameful that a government can preside over this fraud.  The judges said Kenyatta was not at fault and the blame lay with the election commission, which had not followed procedures designed to allow a transparent vote. A more detailed ruling is expected this month. Jubilee has also denied manipulating the vote. But Odinga s words may resonate with Kenyans tired of the corruption scandals that have dominated front pages in recent years, including allegations that tens of millions of dollars went missing from the Health Ministry and National Youth Service.  The auditor-general regularly issues scathing reports about missing funds, but action is rarely taken. No top official has been successfully prosecuted.  Odinga, who presents himself as a champion of the poor, built his previous campaign on criticism of high inflation and shortages of the staple maize flour after a regional drought.  He has criticized government borrowing, and promised to lower the deficit by improving revenue collection and slashing graft. He said he would preserve the large infrastructure projects that were the centerpiece of Kenyatta s re-election campaign.  Odinga also plans to substantially reshape Kenya s policy towards its neighbors if he wins, setting a timeline to withdraw Kenyan troops from Somalia and calling for the release of South Sudanese rebel leader Riek Machar, currently under house arrest in South Africa, to participate in peace talks.

"[VIDEO] DENZEL WASHINGTON GIVES GOD-CENTERED COMMENCEMENT SPEECH On Same Day As Michelle Obama’s Hateful, Racist Rant To Grads","Two high profile black people giving commencement speeches at predominately black universities with two very different messages. One speaker delivered a message of hope, humility and encouragement. The other speaker delivered a message of racism, hate, resentment and a call to stand up and fight against the oppressive white man who spends his time looking for a reason to discriminate against them.Dillard University s 218 members of the Class of 2015 received a special treat in addition to their diplomas   Academy and Tony Award-winning actor Denzel Washington to deliver the keynote commencement address. And in contrast to the whiney, racial and excuse-driven address delivered by first lady Michelle Obama at another historically black university, Washington s was filled of hope, humor, inspiration and love of his creator.  No. 1,  he resolutely told the graduates of the New Orleans university,  Put. God. First! Washington told the class that God has kept him centered throughout his life, I ve been protected, I ve been directed, I ve been corrected. I ve kept God in my life and it s kept me humble,  he said.  I didn t always stick with him, but he s always stuck with me. Stick with him in everything you do.  Toward the end of his brief address, he gave some sage advice.  I pray that you put your slippers way under your bed tonight, so that when you wake up in the morning you have to get on your knees to reach them,  Washington said.  And while you re down there, say,  thank you. Thank you for grace, thank you for mercy, thank you for understanding, thank you for wisdom, thank you for parents, thank you for love, thank you for kindness, thank you for humility, thank you for peace, thank you for prosperity. Say  thank you  in advance for what s already yours. True desire in the heart for anything good is God s proof to you, sent beforehand, to indicate that it s yours already,  Washington said.  Don t just aspire to make a living,  he concluded,  aspire to make a difference. On Saturday   the same day as Washington s address   the first lady delivered her own commencement speech at Tuskegee University.https://youtu.be/4w3eFiVUHQQ But instead of inspiration-driven, hers was racially motivated.  The road ahead is not going to be easy. It never is, especially for folks like you and me,  she said.  Because while we ve come so far, the truth is those age-old problems are stubborn, and they haven t fully gone away.  Her resentment was as palpable as Washington s gratitude was evident.

India's Modi heads to Myanmar as Rohingya refugee crisis worsens,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss rising violence in Myanmar s western Rakhine state during a visit that begins on Tuesday, and push for greater progress on long-running Indian infrastructure projects, officials said.  India seeks to boost economic ties with resource-rich Myanmar, with which it shares a 1,600-km (1,000-mile) border, to counter Chinese influence and step up connectivity with a country it considers its gateway to Southeast Asia. Two-way trade has grown to around $2.2 billion as India courted Myanmar following the gradual end of military rule, but Indian-funded projects have moved slowly. Modi s promises to  Act East  and cement ties with India s eastern neighbor have slipped even as China has strengthened its influence. His first bilateral visit comes amid a spike in violence in Rakhine, after a military counter-offensive against insurgents killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of nearly 90,000 villagers to Bangladesh since Aug. 25. The violence could hit development of a transport corridor that begins in Rakhine, with the Indian-built port of Sittwe and includes road links to India s remote northeast, analysts said.  It s going to be a very vexed and complex issue,  said Tridivesh Singh Maini, a New Delhi-based expert on ties with Myanmar.  You need to play it very smartly. You need to make it clear that Rakhine violence has regional implications... but India will not get into saying,  This is how you should resolve it.  Last month, India said it wanted to deport 40,000 Rohingya refugees who left Myanmar in previous years. Modi arrives from China late on Tuesday in the capital Naypyidaw to meet President Htin Kyaw on a three-day visit. New Delhi believes the best way to reduce tension in Rakhine is through development efforts, such as the Kaladan transport project there, said Indian foreign ministry official Sripriya Ranganathan.      We are very confident that once that complete corridor is functional, there will be a positive impact on the situation in the state,  she told reporters. Modi will meet Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and visit the heritage city of Bagan and a Hindu temple. The countries share close cultural ties, and several in Myanmar trace their roots to India.  Modi will also talk up a trilateral highway project connecting India s northeast with Myanmar and Thailand.  There is a fear that China is already going full steam ahead,  said Udai Bhanu Singh of Delhi think-tank, the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.  From the Indian side, there has been some laxity.   Singh said India could offer Myanmar help in building its navy and coastguard, while Myanmar would seek assurances that India was a reliable economic partner and an alternative power to Beijing.

Indigenous protesters seize oil wells in Peruvian Amazon: chief,"LIMA (Reuters) - Villagers in the Peruvian Amazon have shut down at least 50 oil wells operated by Frontera Energy Corp to protest talks over a new contract even as past pollution lingers, the leader of an indigenous federation said on Wednesday. Some 600 members of native Achuar communities in the Corrientes River basin seized the wells on Monday along with an electric plant and oil tanks used by the Canadian company in Block 192, the country s biggest oilfield, said Carlos Sandi, president of the Feconacor federation. The latest protest in a region long plagued by complaints of oil pollution came after the center-right government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski declined to apply an indigenous rights law as it negotiates with Frontera. The so-called prior consultation law, passed in 2011, requires the government to seek input from indigenous people before approving development plans that might affect them. The growing indigenous anger threatens to disrupt Frontera s plans to keep operating in Peru after its two-year contract expires. Frontera has been negotiating a long-term contract for Block 192 with state energy regulator Perupetro. Tribal leaders had warned they would forcibly halt oil operations there unless their demands were taken into account through prior consultation. Communities in Block 192 mainly want past oil pollution cleaned up and better access to education and healthcare, Sandi said. Frontera, which has operated Block 192 for the past two years, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Protests could expand into other parts of Block 192 as Quechua villagers readied plans to seize 16 additional oil wells and an airport in the Pastaza River basin on Thursday, said Aurelio Chino, president of the indigenous federation Fediquep. Peru s Culture Ministry, charged with protecting indigenous rights, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last week, the ministry rejected the communities  request for prior consultation, but said the government might reconsider if new measures regarding Block 192 were implemented. Block 192 in Peru s Loreto region produced about 9,500 barrels of oil per day in August, according to official data. ",worldnews,"September 20, 2017 ",1,2267
LIBERAL HACK KATIE COURIC Says Fake News Is “Tearing [America] Apart”…Doesn’t Mention $12 MILLION Dollar Lawsuit Against Her For Producing Edited Story To Push Gun Control [VIDEO],"Katie Couric is a wolf in sheep s clothing. Dan Rather, Brian Williams and Katie Couric will forever be known as some of the worst liars at CBS and NBC, two of the three major news networks where most Americans used to go to get their news.Katie Couric, who still faces a $12 million defamation lawsuit stemming from a deceptive edit in a film she produced, decried the effect of fake news on America during an interview on Thursday.Couric told the New York Daily News she believes fake news is  tearing [America] apart at the seams  while discussing her latest effort cohosting a music and politics event in New York City.  I remember I got sent a lot of stories from friends who were quite educated and were like,  Did you see this?'  Couric said.  And I would say,  Come on, you re kidding, right? This is BS.' She did not mention the controversy surrounding a deceptive edit included in her 2016 film Under the Gun. During one scene in the movie Couric is shown asking a group of gun rights activists from the Virginia Citizens Defense League a question about background checks. The group is then shown sitting in silence for nine seconds with nobody offering a response to the question.  WFBListen to Rush Limbaugh explain why Katie Couric is  not a good person  and  not a nice woman :The makers of a new Katie Couric documentary on gun violence deceptively edited an interview between Couric and a group of gun rights activists in an apparent attempt to embarrass the activists, an audio recording of the full interview shows.At the 21:48 mark of Under the Gun a scene of Katie Couric interviewing members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights organization, is shown.Couric can be heard in the interview asking activists from the group,  If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun? The documentary then shows the activists sitting silently for nine awkward seconds, unable to provide an answer. It then cuts to the next scene. The moment can be watched here:However, raw audio of the interview between Katie Couric and the activists provided to the Washington Free Beacon shows the scene was deceptively edited. Instead of silence, Couric s question is met immediately with answers from the activists. A back and forth between a number of the league s members and Couric over the issue of background checks proceeds for more than four minutes after the original question is asked.LISTEN HERE:John Lott, Jr. explains to The Blaze s Dana Loesch how this  documentary  was rigged from the outset:Under the Gun has been labeled  dishonest politicking in the guise of media coverage,   loose with the facts,  and  a full-length assault on guns and the Second Amendment  by those in the gun community since its debut on May 15.The Virginia Citizens Defense League labeled the deceptively edited segment featured in the film  unbelievable and extremely unprofessional.  Philip Van Cleave, the organization s president, said the editing was done deliberately to make it appear that league members didn t have a response to Couric s question. Katie Couric asked a key question during an interview of some members of our organization,  he said.  She then intentionally removed their answers and spliced in nine seconds of some prior video of our members sitting quietly and not responding. Viewers are left with the misunderstanding that the members had no answer to her question. Nora Ryan, the chief of staff for EPIX, the cable channel that is airing the documentary, told the Free Beacon in an email,  Under the Gun is a critically-acclaimed documentary that looks at the polarizing and politicized issue of gun violence, a subject that elicits strong reactions from people on both sides.

"Arizona man challenges primary results, alleging misconduct ","PHOENIX (Reuters) - An Arizona man filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the results of the state’s March presidential primary election, alleging misconduct by officials during a nominating contest that is already mired in controversy. The lawsuit filed by Tucson resident John Brakey alleges that officials improperly handled voter registration requests and permitted illegal votes to be cast in the election, which was marred by long lines at polling stations and allegations of discrimination against minority voters. The three-count complaint, filed late on Friday afternoon against Arizona’s secretary of state and 15 counties, also claims that erroneous ballots were counted by officials on election day. It seeks to enjoin the state from certifying the results “until such election is properly conducted and in compliance with every requirement of Arizona law,” according to the lawsuit. The legal action comes amid an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the election’s handling by Maricopa County officials that saw outraged votes wait up to five hours to cast their ballots at polls. Some county residents waited long after the polls had officially closed and projected results announced to vote at one of 60 election sites, a reduced number of locations made in cost-cutting efforts by officials. Two hundred polls were set up for the same election in 2012. Officials immediately took the blame for misjudging the number of people who would show up at the polls to cast ballots, saying that their decision were based on turnout history and an increase in mail-in voters. U.S. Justice Department officials are investigating whether federal voting laws were violated after complaints of long lines at polling stations and allegations that there was disproportionate waiting times in areas with high numbers of minority people. Maricopa County officials have until April 22 to respond to the questions from the head of the voting section of the department’s civil rights division. Such an investigation was requested by Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, who called the March 22 election won by Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump “a fiasco” that was unacceptable. A hearing on the lawsuit has been set for April 19.

Minor train disruption rattles Singapore's reputation for glitch-free services,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore is grappling with a controversy that refuses to go away, a month after rainwater flooded a tunnel of its mass rapid transit (MRT) service, leading to the partial suspension of train runs at weekends. A rare public apology by top transit executives and an assurance from the government that the cause was clear and the fix not complicated have done little to appease the public that has come to expect glitch-free efficiency.     The front page of the state-owned Straits Times newspaper this week featured a photo of grim-faced top transit executives in the gallery of parliament as the transport minister said they had to do better and could face pay cuts.  The facts of the 7 October incident are not complicated, and the cause of the incident is clear,  Minister Khaw Boon Wan said, adding that poor maintenance and neglect of duties by transit managers were to blame.  It is the responsibility of management to set the right culture of professionalism and excellence. It begins from the top. And if there is poor culture, the CEO is responsible.  The scrutiny of the disruption, which in most cities would be considered minor and barely newsworthy, reflected the pressure on the government to explain how it had failed to deliver a near-perfect public service.  Singapore residents are highly dependent on public transport. It is one of the world s most expensive places to own a vehicle and it recently announced that it will not allow any growth in its car population from February. Voter discontent with public services can be particularly alarming to the ruling party which saw its worst election showing in 2011 when 40 percent of voters went against it, partly in dismay over the growing strains on public transport. The People s Action Party has ruled Singapore, one of the richest and most stable countries in the world, without interruption since independence in 1965.  Transit operator SMRT chief Desmond Kuek was quoted in an email to staff as saying this week should have been a celebration marking the 30-year anniversary of the subway operations.  Instead, we were awash in collective shame because a few of our staff had let us down,  Kuek said in the email, according to the Straits Times. ",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",1,2320

 FBI Director Just Smacked The Smug Look Off Trey Gowdy’s Face And Left Him Speechless (VIDEO),"Professional Clinton witch hunter Trey Gowdy probably expected the public grilling of FBI Director James Comey to go a lot better than it did.

For hours, Comey maintained a superhuman level of cool as he answered every ridiculous question Gowdy and pals threw at him as they struggled to find something   anything   they could use to rake the former Secretary of state over the coals.While discussing intent to commit a crime, Gowdy explained to Comey that the FBI director was a  white collar prosecutor  while he was a  gutter prosecutor    something that appears to be a dog-whistle term for  black people    and that the people Gowdy prosecuted were too stupid to know that murder is wrong.Gowdy told Comey that he is  reading a specific-intent element into a gross negligence statute  regarding Clinton s supposed willful lawbreaking   and that s when Comey dropped the hammer: The question you gotta ask is why is it that the Department of Justice since 1917 has not used that gross negligence statute but charging it once in an espionage case. Whether their decision was smart or not, that is the record of fairness. So you have to decide, so I treat this person against that record, and if I do is that a fair thing to do? Even if you re not worried about the constitutionality of it, my judgment is no reasonable prosecutor would do that.

 Friend Of Stanford Rapist: Not Everyone Who Rapes In College Is A Rapist,"Absolutely everything about the story of Brock Turner, the convicted Stanford swim team rapist, is gag-worthy. He received a particularly light sentence (more on that in a bit), his father thought he shouldn t have had any sentence because it was just  20 minutes of action.  Now, a friend of Turner has spoken and her (yes her) attitude is that we are being way too politically correct because well, he s in college, or something like that.Apparently, according to Turner s childhood friend, Leslie Rasmussen, a rapist isn t really a rapist when it happens on a college campus: I don t think it s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him. I am not blaming her directly for this, because that isn t right. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn t always because people are rapists. Then, the obligatory victim blaming: This is completely different from a woman getting kidnapped and raped as she is walking to her car in a parking lot. That is a rapist. These are not rapists. These are idiot boys and girls having too much to drink and not being aware of their surroundings and having clouded judgement. No, this was not a case of two drunk kids taking things a little too far. This was a violent sexual assault. Here s just some of it, as retold by the victim:He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don t ask, can I finger you? Usually there s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He s in the clear. Even in his story, I only said a total of three words, yes yes yes, before he had me half naked on the ground. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls down help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls down, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls down help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that s why she wore the cardigan.Clearly, calling Turner a  rapist  isn t political correctness. It s simply a fact. Brock was convicted of three felony counts. While the maximum sentence for his offenses might have been 10 years, he will likely only serve three months. As horrendously unjust as that sentence is, it s still about three months longer than 97 percent of rapists serve. That s political incorrectness if I ve ever heard it.Featured image via video screen grab. ",News,"June 7, 2016",0,3172

TRUMP IS REPORTEDLY Preparing Executive Order To Deport Illegals Living On Welfare…Kill Anchor Baby Benefits,"According to the Center for Immigration Studies, in 2012 approximately 51 percent of all immigrant households collected welfare: HOW THE USDA Helps Illegal Aliens Get FREE Benefits Paid For By YOU! This is a problem. A lot of American households also collect welfare, and that is a problem as well.A liberal newspaper claims it has obtained copies of two of President Donald Trump s upcoming executive orders that if implemented would once and for all stop immigrants from leeching off the American taxpayer.Obtained by The Washington Post, the orders would reportedly  deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge  and set up standards for  determining whether an alien is deportable   for having become a public charge within five years of entry. The underlying goal would be to make the U.S. immigration system more  merit-based,  so those with the potential to contribute to the country would be welcome, whereas those more likely to be a burden to the American taxpayer would be kept out.According to New York magazine, the order would also  bar undocumented immigrants from accessing the child tax credit, even when their children are U.S. citizens,  which would be a huge blow to illegal immigrant families hoping to cash in on their anchor babies.The simple fact is that as a sovereign nation, the United States reserves the right to demand the very best from anyone who aspires to live here. It is a fact that the U.S. actually has much more lenient immigration policies than a large number of Western countries that liberals profess to admire. Try immigrating to Canada or Western Europe if you don t believe it.If an immigrant works hard, obtains citizenship and leads a good life but is later laid off and needs to collect welfare for a bit, that s one thing. But when someone immigrates here and then immediately boards the welfare train, that is another   and it s a problem that President Trump hopes to finally resolve.For entire story: Conservative Tribune",politics,"Feb 4, 2017",0,2104
Clinton leads Trump by 11 points in White House race: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"(Reuters) - Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 11 points in the U.S. presidential race, showing little change after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.   The online poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, shows 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 34.8 percent back Trump. Another 19.2 percent support neither candidate. Their parties hold conventions in July ahead of a Nov. 8 election. Clinton’s lead was nearly the same a week ago, before she had amassed enough convention delegates to win the nomination and before Trump drew criticism from leaders of both parties for questioning the impartiality of a Mexican-American judge. Trump, 69, enjoyed a bigger boost after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in May. Having trailed Clinton, 68, for most of the year, Trump briefly erased a double-digit gap and pulled about even with the former secretary of state. Clinton this week defeated party rival Bernie Sanders, 74, in four of six nominating contests, most notably California and New Jersey, and won the endorsements of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other party leaders. Trump this week sparred with party leaders and struggled with questions about his now-defunct Trump University. A lawsuit accuses Trump and the for-profit school of defrauding thousands of people, including many who paid as much as $35,000 to learn Trump’s real estate strategies.  A wealthy businessman who asserts the lawsuit is politically motivated, Trump said presiding U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel was biased against him because of Trump’s plans to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump later added that Muslim judges could be biased against him also because of his pledge to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Trump’s comments drew sharp criticism from Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump later said he would no longer talk about the judge. Friday’s results had 1,276 respondents and a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.2 percentage points.

 BUSTED: Melania Trump Wanted To Use Her Role As First Lady To Personally Profit,"This is unseemly behavior by a First Lady and it s totally unconstitutional.Donald Trump s wife is throwing a hissy fit because she has allegedly been prevented from personally profiting off being First Lady because of a story alleging that she worked as an escort.Melania Trump filed a seeking $150 million from The Daily Mail, and her attorneys actually admitted that she had hoped to enrich herself and her family by turning the role of First Lady into a sales pitch for her shitty product lines.According to the lawsuit filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court by lawyer Charles Harder, Mail Online s conduct was extreme and outrageous in falsely making the scurrilous charge that the future First Lady of the United States worked as a prostitute. Plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.These product categories would have included, among other things, apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care and fragrance.The [statements] also constitute defamation per se because they impugned on her fitness to perform her duties as First Lady of the United States. Seriously.Melania Trump literally hoped she could disgrace the role of First Lady by using it to enrich herself.There s just one huge problem.As Raw Story points out, using a government position to personally profit is a violation of the Constitution.It s also sleazy and greedy.The First Lady is supposed to do things to help others, not herself. The Trumps are already filthy rich and they get paid a salary every year as compensation for being in public office. If the Trumps really only sought the presidency in some sort of scheme to enrich themselves, they should leave the office in disgrace before they are impeached or sentenced to prison like former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife, who also tried to use public office to personally profit. Voters and taxpayers did not send Trump to the White House to work for himself and his bank account. They sent him there to work for the American people. And Melania Trump is turning out to be an embarrassment as First Lady just as much as her husband is an embarrassment as president.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"February 7, 2017",0,2561
North Korea says sanctions threaten survival of its children,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea told a U.N. rights panel that international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs would endanger the survival of North Korean children. Han Tae Song, Pyongyang s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, was speaking at a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child late on Wednesday. The panel of independent experts challenged North Korean officials over allegations of forced child labor, sexual abuse and trafficking in North Korea, Pyongyang s health and education budget, and Internet access for children. Han said North Korea, whose population is 26 million, is a  people-centered socialist country... where protection and promotion of the rights and welfare of the child are given top priority ... There is room for improvement.  But Han said that new sanctions imposed by the United States and the U.N. Security Council over North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile tests were hampering the production of nutritional goods for children and provision of textbooks.  The persistent and vicious blockade and sanctions against the DPRK (Democratic People s Republic of Korea) are not only hampering the endeavors for the protection and promotion of the rights of the child but also seriously threatening their right to survival,  he said, calling for sanctions to be lifted. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest earlier this month capping fuel supplies to the isolated state. Han said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un - denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump as  Rocket Man  -  personally guides the construction in different parts of the country of schoolchildren s palaces, children s hospitals, baby homes, children s homes, and primary and secondary boarding schools and works with devotion for the well-being of the young generation . South Korea approved a plan on Thursday to send $8 million worth of aid to North Korea as China warned the crisis on the divided Korean peninsula was getting more serious by the day and the war of words between Pyongyang and Washington continued. The U.N. panel asked how North Korea s  songbun  (caste system) that ranks citizens based on family loyalty to the ruling dynasty affected children s access to education, health and food. The North Korean delegation replied that this was an  imaginary concept  invented by hostile forces. Human Rights Watch has called on the rights panel to press North Korea s delegation on cases of child sexual abuse, which the New York-based group said it had documented.       The (North Korean government) report was silent on the issue of sexual abuse so the delegation was asked to provide data,  read a U.N. summary of the hearing.  North Korea s delegation said that forced child labor did not exist in the country and was banned, and that the maximum duration of young people s work in agricultural fields was limited to three weeks per year.   In response to a question on the use of the Internet, the delegation explained that there was public control of this medium in order to give preference to access to positive information for children. In addition, all children had access to the (North Korean internal) Intranet,  the summary said. The committee will issue its conclusions on Oct. 4. ",worldnews,"September 21, 2017 ",1,3416
" Trump Supporters Didn’t Vote Because Of The Economy; It Was Racism, And Here’s PROOF","Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there s proof.The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked  How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.  Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It s VERY unlikely that whites aren t getting jobs because minorities are, but that s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it s  extremely likely  that minorities are taking jobs from white people.Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon.Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed.Post election, this is what the study found:The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is  extremely likely  that whites can t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is  not at all  likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is  extremely likely  people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don t think that.More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are  violent.  84 percent think that of Muslims.Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this:Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation.Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots  claims go unchallenged.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"November 13, 2016",0,2880
"More first-time voters, late-deciders in U.S. presidential race: Reuters/Ipsos","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some 15 percent of Americans who cast a ballot on Tuesday said it was their first time voting in a presidential election, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll, up from 9 percent of voters who said so in 2012. The poll of nearly 35,000 people also showed that 13 percent of voters had waited until the final week of the presidential race to make up their mind between the candidates, who include Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, up from 9 percent who said so in 2012. The Federal Bureau of Investigation announced in late October that it was looking at more emails connected to its investigation of Clinton’s use of a personal email server while secretary of state.

Two senior Republican senators criticize Tillerson comments on Russia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Republican U.S. senators criticized Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday for saying that Russia may have the “right approach” on Syria and for what they called his lack of focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan. “His statements about Syria really disturb me. No, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does not have it right when it comes to Syria,” Senator Lindsey Graham said. In separate television interviews, Graham and Senator John McCain, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, took aim at Tillerson’s remarks last week that Russia may have “got the right approach” and the United States the wrong approach to Syria. Russia has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, while the United States supports rebel groups trying to overthrow him. McCain told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he “sometimes” regretted backing Tillerson’s nomination by Republican President Donald Trump and that his comments on Russia being “right” on Syria made him emotional and upset. “I know what the slaughter has been like. I know that the Russians knew that Bashar Assad was going to use chemical weapons. And to say that maybe we’ve got the wrong approach?” he said. Both senators backed the nomination of Tillerson in January, even while expressing concern about his dealings with Russia when he was chief executive of ExxonMobil. (XOM.N) Graham, who visited Afghanistan and Pakistan last week with McCain, accused Tillerson of being “AWOL” on the two countries and failing to fill key State Department posts. “I am so worried about the State Department,” Graham said  on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” A State Department official responded to the criticism of Tillerson by saying that a U.S.-Russian-brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria was an example of what the secretary had described as the potential to coordinate with Russia, in spite of unresolved differences, “to produce stability and serve our mutual security interests.” The official, who did not want to be identified, also said the State Department was taking an active role in a review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy and continued to work with the White House on nominations. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year.

China tests new dredger capable of South China Sea projects: state media,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is testing a new dredger ship that will greatly enhance its land reclamation capabilities, a state media report said on Sunday, as the country continues to develop facilities in the South China Sea in a bid to strengthen its claims in the waters. State-run Beijing News newspaper said the Tian Kun began water tests on Friday. A cutter suction dredger is a type of a ship used for large-scale projects to create or reclaim land.       For example, there are many hard coral reefs on the sea floor of the South China Sea,  the paper quoted Zhang Xiaofeng, chief engineer for the vessel, as saying, adding the ship will be put into service sometime in the first half of 2018.  Recent satellite images show that China has quietly undertaken more construction and reclamation in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, in a bid to strengthen its grip despite objections from Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam as well as the United States. Some experts say China will land its first deployments of jet fighters onto its runways in the Spratly islands in coming months.  The United States is concerned China s construction of islands and military buildup in the waters could be used to restrict free nautical movement. Its ships have carried out freedom of navigation patrols in the area, angering China.  The subject could come up when Trump visits Beijing next week as part of his 12-day Asia trip and meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though North Korea s recent nuclear and missile tests are expected to feature more prominently in talks.  The South China Sea issue isn t an issue between China and the United States,  China Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday, adding there is no issue with freedom of navigation in the region and that China has indisputable sovereignty over islands and surrounding waters.

 WATCH: Hypocrite Mike Pence Calls Democratic Obstruction Of Trump’s Supreme Court Nominee ‘Unprecedented’,"This is unbelievably outrageous.Republicans are literally pretending that the last eight years never happened.In February 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, leaving a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Obama was responsible to fill. But Scalia s body was not even cold before Republicans vowed to block any nominee he selected for the position.And so, Republicans did just that and refused to even grant Merrick Garland a hearing despite the fact that he is a moderate centrist who enjoyed support from Republicans in the past.Republicans excused their unprecedented behavior by claiming that lame-duck presidents can t pick Supreme Court nominees and claimed that the American people should get a say in November about who should pick the next Supreme Court Justice.Th GOP has three problems here. First, President Obama was elected twice by the American people and therefore had the right to choose the nominee. Second, there is plenty of historical examples of presidents picking Supreme Court nominees and getting them confirmed during their final year in office. Ronald Reagan is one of them. And finally, the American people did not vote for Donald Trump, they voted for Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.So Trump definitely does not have a mandate and Republicans do not have any excuses for their obstruction.But Democrats certainly do have a really good excuse to block Trump s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the high court. After all, Republicans created the new precedent last year by refusing to confirm Garland. Republicans literally stole a Supreme Court seat from President Obama and the Democratic Party.But Mike Pence claims that even threatening to obstruct Trump s nominee is  unprecedented. During a speech to the Federalist Society, Pence promised that Gorsuch  will pick up where Scalia left off.  In other words, he ll be a complete dick who wants to repeal every Supreme Court ruling that protects the rights of women, minorities, gay people, the environment, etc until this nation is taken all the way back to the 1850s.And then he said this. Several announced their opposition within minutes of his nomination, and now they re even threatening to use the filibuster procedure in the Senate to stop him. Make no mistake about it, this is an unwise and an unprecedented act .This seat does not belong to any party or any ideology or any interest group, this seat on the Supreme Court belongs to the American people, and the American people deserve a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Here s the video via YouTube.Democrats should block Trump s Supreme Court pick at all costs. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans are hypocrites for whining about obstruction when they are the ones who totally disrespected President Obama and Merrick Garland in the first place. They only have themselves to blame for what Democrats are threatening to do and they have no right to complain after the way they acted last year. If Republicans wanted Democrats to cooperate with Trump, they should have thought about that before acting like complete traitors toward President Obama.Republicans wanted the Supreme Court to just have eight justices and that has lasted for a year now. It s time for Democrats to extend that wait to another four years. And if Republicans change the rules to force Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, Democrats should impeach him and Trump when they get control of Congress and show Republicans what the word  unprecedented  really means.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 4, 2017",0,3640

Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. to meet with House panel Dec. 6: CNN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., will meet with the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee next week, CNN reported on Wednesday, citing multiple sources with knowledge of the agreement. Representatives for Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican leading the panel’s investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by Trump’s campaign, and Representative Adam Schiff, the panel’s top Democrat, said they could not comment on whether Trump’s eldest son was going to appear before the committee.  Schiff told reporters that he could not comment on when or if Donald Trump Jr. might appear, but described him as a key witness. The younger Trump played a central role in his father’s campaign. “Obviously, when Donald Trump Jr. comes before the committee there are innumerable areas that we’re going to be interested in. It’s hard to find a more central figure in this,” Schiff told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. Schiff also said he thought it would “very likely” be necessary to bring the president’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, to testify again before the intelligence panel. The panel questioned Kushner behind closed doors in July. A lawyer for Donald Trump Jr., Alan Futerfas, did not respond to a request for comment.  CNN said the meeting with lawmakers would be held next Wednesday. The House intelligence panel is one of the three main congressional committees, as well as Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller, investigating the issue. In September, the younger Trump spoke privately with Senate Judiciary Committee staff. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Senator Richard Burr, has said his panel planned to interview Donald Trump Jr. in December. Trump’s son, who has denied any wrongdoing, met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016. Earlier this month, he released exchanges he had with the Twitter account of WikiLeaks, which released emails stolen from Democrats, during the campaign. The House Intelligence Committee will hear on Thursday from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose contacts with Russians during the campaign have also come under scrutiny, as well as from Erik Prince, who founded the private military contractor Blackwater and was a supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign.

U.S. coal companies ask Trump to stick with Paris climate deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some big American coal companies have advised President Donald Trump’s administration to break his promise to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement – arguing that the accord could provide their best forum for protecting their global interests. Remaining in the global deal to combat climate change will give U.S. negotiators a chance to advocate for coal in the future of the global energy mix, coal companies like Cloud Peak Energy Inc and Peabody Energy Corp told White House officials over the past few weeks, according to executives and a U.S. official familiar with the discussions. “The future is foreign markets, so the last thing you want to do if you are a coal company is to give up a U.S. seat in the international climate discussions and let the Europeans control the agenda,” said the official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. “They can’t afford for the most powerful advocate for fossil fuels to be away from the table,” the official said. Cloud Peak and Peabody officials confirmed the discussions. In Cloud Peak’s view, staying in the agreement and trying to encourage “a more balanced, reasonable and appropriate path forward” on fossil fuel technologies among signatories to the accord seems like a reasonable stance, said Cloud Peak’s vice president of government affairs, Richard Reavey. The coal industry was interested in ensuring that the Paris deal provides a role for low-emission coal-fired power plants and financial support for carbon capture and storage technology, the officials said. They also want the pact to protect multilateral funding for international coal projects through bodies like the World Bank. The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, would seek to limit global warming by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from burning fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump vowed to pull the United States out of the pact, tapping into a well of concern among his fellow Republicans that the United States’ energy habits would be policed by the United Nations. But since being elected, he has been mostly quiet on the issue, and administration officials have recently been asking energy companies for advice. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week that the administration expected to make a decision on whether to remain a party to the deal by the time leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations meet in late May. The prospect of the United States remaining in the Paris deal has irritated some smaller miners, including Murray Energy Corp, whose chief executive, Robert Murray helped fund Trump’s presidential bid. Staying in the Paris accord could also face resistance from within Trump’s party. Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota has been circulating a letter among Republican lawmakers calling on the president to stay in the deal but has gathered only seven signatures so far.

" NYPD Official Sick Of Trump’s Costs To City, Wants Him To Vacate Trump Tower (DETAILS)","One of the things that happens when one runs for president is the fact that the United States Secret Service and other intelligence and security agencies begin to protect that person and his or her family. If said family is that of the elected President or Vice-President, that protection becomes the expense of the American taxpayers   no matter where those people are. In the case of Donald Trump becoming president-elect, that means that New York City is now paying astronomical amounts of money to protect the Trump family. This is especially expensive, seeing as how the Trumps, prior to The Donald running for   and eventually winning   the presidential election, lived in a golden glass tower in the middle of New York City s Fifth Avenue, which is one of the busiest streets in the world.Well, one person is sick of Trump being able to milk the taxpayers of New York City   a city that in no way voted for him   for huge amounts of money and even more inconvenience to protect him and his family and their staff in the Fifth Avenue version of a palace in America. New York City Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence, John Miller, is sick of the Trumps bleeding a city that can t stand the guy and his family and didn t want them in the White House to begin with, and he doesn t want the people of New York City footing the bill on this one. Miller says of the chaos and money Trump is causing the city: We went down to Washington and we described those costs to our congressional delegation from New York. They got it immediately. But Congress has failed to pass a budget again. And to get funding for this, they had a continuing resolution. We asked them to add $35 million to reimburse New York City for [Trump s security]. They came up with a figure of $7 million, which covers a piece of the overtime but not the rest of it. Miller continued on, saying that New York City is  obviously disappointed,  with the idea of protecting Trump via taxpayer dollars in a city that clearly despises the man. Miller continued: We really won t be able to gauge the long-term costs, John, until we know: Is he coming home every weekend?

"Factbox: Humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh as 313,000 Rohingyas flee Myanmar","(Reuters) - At least 313,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Myanmar in the past two weeks and sought shelter in Bangladesh, a Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) report released on Monday stated.  At least 400,000 hungry and traumatized refugees have sought refuge in Bangladesh since October 2016. The exodus has put pressure on aid agencies and communities, which were already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous violent episodes in Myanmar. Following are a few details gathered from United Nations  sources working in Cox s Bazar district of Bangladesh, situated on the Myanmar border. - The refugee influx on Sunday was observed to be lower compared with other days.  - The district administration conducted a site visit to discuss the allocation of 1,500 acres of land adjacent to the Kutupalong Makeshift Settlement in order to accommodate more refugees in the Kutupalong/Balukhali area. People have already settled in some parts of this proposed land.  - According to reports, the local administration plans to start biometric registration of the new arrivals from Monday.  - At least 3,989 households were provided rice on Sunday, the second day of rice distribution.  - The majority of referred medical cases comprised lower respiratory tract infection, skin diseases and acute diarrhea.  - An estimate of 883 refugees received psychological first aid.  - Until Sunday, a total of 925 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have been identified in registered refugee camps.

"WATCH: ANGRY PARENTS WALK OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL’S RACIST, ANTI-COP COMMENCEMENT SPEECH [Video]","Another leftist educator uses the precious time they ve been given to deliver an inspirational speech to high school graduates to instead, deliver a radical, divisive and hateful message. A Missouri high school principal sent some parents toward the exits last week when he made a disparaging remark about police  killing young black men  during a graduation speech.Belton High School Principal Fred Skretta was talking about why he became a teacher when he suddenly veered off in an unexpected direction. I wanted to be a teacher because I wanted to change the world, I wanted to make it a better place,  he told the audience.  I m going to be honest with you, in a lot of ways I fear that we are not there yet. If we were there, we wouldn t have conflicts between police killing young black men. https://youtu.be/mQHKFGBPREUNever mind the poor sentence structure. Some parents were so offended by the commentary they got up and walked out of the ceremony, according to Fox 4 News. I found it very inappropriate, I am highly offended,  a parent said.  You don t use the platform of a child s graduation to push a political agenda or push your personal opinions.  Your job is supposed to inspire, educate, inform and not indoctronize one way or the other. Interestingly, Fox4News reported that Skretta posted an apology on social media after the ceremony, but the Twitter account appears to have been deleted since then.The apology, according to the Fox affiliate: TY all at #BHS graduation! I apologize if my remarks were offensive. Our law enforcement have difficult jobs & I meant no disrespect #agape  Doc Skretta (@Principal_BHS) May 17, 2015 Belton district deputy superintendent, Steve Morgan, later offered an apology also, Fox4News reported.

Eight Kenyan schoolgirls die in dormitory blaze: government,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Eight Kenyan teenage schoolgirls died and 10 more were hospitalized after a fire engulfed their boarding school dormitory in Nairobi early on Saturday morning, a government official said.  The cause of the fire was not known, and the government ordered Moi Girls School closed for two weeks while it investigated, education minister Fred Matiangi told reporters when he visited the school.  A fire broke out at the school at 2:00am in the morning in one of the dormitories,  said Matiangi. He said the school, which has nearly 1,200 students, is  one of our top schools in the country and... (one) that we are very proud of.   A statement from his office on Saturday evening said the death toll had risen from seven to eight. A shaken 16-year-old schoolgirl, Daniella Maina, told Reuters:  We were sleeping and a girl woke us up and said that our hostel was burning. We were helped to safety by some teachers.   Fires have in the past claimed the lives of dozens of Kenyan boarding school students. In 2001, 58 schoolboys were killed in a dormitory fire at Kyanguli Secondary School outside Nairobi. In 2012, eight students were killed at a school in Homa Bay County in western Kenya. Lax safety standards and poor emergency procedures have been blamed for some past fires at schools and for other tragedies such as the collapse of a residential building in Nairobi in May that killed nearly 50 people.  The Kenyan police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Saturday morning. ",worldnews,"September 2, 2017 ",1,1583
 Maine’s Gov. LePage OWNED On Live Radio By Woman Who Has No Insurance Thanks To Him,"Maine s Governor Paul LePage is a Tea Party idiot who refused Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, and all the federal funding that comes with it. The Medicaid expansion part of Obamacare was designed to help people obtain coverage who earned too little to qualify for insurance on the exchanges, but too much to qualify for Medicaid. LePage screwed over tens of thousands of Maine residents with his decision, and one woman was not going to let him get away with it if she could help it.The woman, who was identified as Laura, falls into that gap between qualifying for Obamacare and qualifying for Medicaid. She called in while LePage was being interviewed on Maine Public Radio specifically to blast him on behalf of the 60,000 Maine residents who are still without health insurance because of him: I m actually one of the people affected by the health care issue in Maine, so LePage is wrong in saying that people aren t affected or that wouldn t get the insurance. I would get the insurance if we accepted that money federally. LePage has been perpetuating the lies that no coverage gap actually exists, and that Maine wouldn t qualify for federal funds anyway because their Medicaid program accepts people with incomes of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line. So, of course, he insulted Laura by asking her why she doesn t qualify for Medicaid. Her response was: I make too little money to be on Obamacare. It s expected that if you go to Obamacare that you re going to make a certain amount of money so you can afford the premiums. But if you make $11,500 a year To that, LePage replied that she does qualify for Medicaid, and she retorted: You don t get Medicaid unless you re pregnant, disabled or over 55. This woman is a social worker, so her job includes helping people get access to certain things, including Medicaid. Therefore, she would know this stuff far better than the oppose-Obama-at-all-costs Tea Partier that s in the Governor s Mansion there. The fact that she herself makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid, but too little for Obamacare, was the final nail in the coffin of that conversation.Here s why: LePage s office was hilariously forced to release a statement later in the day admitting that the governor was wrong about the qualifications for Medicaid and the expansion. The state, because of its law, would not qualify for the full 100 percent of federal reimbursement for the first three years, and then the 90 percent every year after that for people between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty line. It qualifies for 62 percent reimbursement there.However, for the 60,000 Maine residents who currently fall into the coverage gap, Maine would qualify for the full federal reimbursement. So Laura triumphantly destroyed LePage s own talking points on the air, forcing his office to clarify things for listeners later on.How embarrassing. We re laughing so hard it hurts.Featured image by MattGagnon. Licensed under Public Domain via Commons",News,"May 26, 2016",0,3087
U.S. prepares to open doors on billion-dollar London embassy,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy in London moves next month to a new billion-dollar home overlooking the River Thames — just as U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions have placed strains on the “special relationship” between Britain and the United States. Britain’s closest ally will leave behind an imposing 1960 stone and concrete embassy in London’s upmarket Grosvenor Square — an area known as ‘Little America’ during World War Two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The old embassy was also a focus for British discontent with U.S. policy. Anti-Vietnam War protests in the 1960s drew thousand of Britons, including celebrities of the day like Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger. The new 12-storey building on the south bank of the river is at the heart of a huge regeneration project in a former industrial zone known as “Nine Elms”. Set in what will become an urban park, it will open for business on Jan. 16, hosting 800 staff and about 1,000 visitors each day. “This embassy, when you look out through the windows, it reflects the global outlook of the U.S. going forward in the 21st century: rather looking out, than looking in,” said Woody Johnson, Trump’s appointed U.S. ambassador to Britain. The U.S. State Department ran a competition to design the new building in 2008. Its $1 billion construction was wholly funded by the sale of other properties in London.  The glass structure “gives form to core democratic values of transparency, openness and equality” a State Department briefing document said. Inside the cube, visitors will be greeted by an imposing stone facade featuring the bald eagle of the United States’ Great Seal. The embassy is also designed to exacting security specifications, set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for the U.S. Marines permanently stationed inside.   “This isn’t just a new office, though, it signifies a new era of friendship between out two countries. President Trump wants us to work more closely than ever with the UK,” Johnson said.    The British relationship with its former colony is a broad political, cultural and military alliance forged over the last century and exercised on battlefields around the world. But it has been tested in recent months. Prime Minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the White House after Trump’s surprise election in November 2016 and used the trip to invite him for a full state visit.  While the two leaders have committed to strengthen trade links and have spoken regularly, their governments have disagreed on several issues, such as Trump’s decision to decertify Iran’s compliance with a multilateral nuclear deal, and his move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A possible state visit by Trump remains a contentious issue among Britons, with lawmakers and campaign groups calling for the offer to be rescinded and promising to take to the streets in protest if he does come to Britain.  “The right to protest is a basic right in this country and our country. Expressing one’s view is well within the bounds of reasonableness,” Johnson said. He said he hoped Trump could attend an as-yet unscheduled opening ceremony for the new building but that there were no firm plans in place. This month, May publicly criticized Trump for reposting British far-right anti-Islam videos from his Twitter accounts. He responded with a rebuke, telling May to focus on Islamic extremism in Britain. ",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017 ",1,3644
Factbox: What to watch for at China's Communist Party Congress,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party on Wednesday opens its 19th Congress, at which President Xi Jinping will map out his ambitions for the country for the next five years and beyond, likely to be high on aspiration and short on concrete details. Here are some key factors to watch out for: - Will Xi resurrect the position of party chairman? Xi is currently the party s general secretary, but not its chairman, a title Mao Zedong and his two successors, Hua Guofeng and Hu Yaobang, both held. Becoming party chairman would put Xi at the same level as Mao and could allow him to effectively end three decades of collective leadership, giving him unparalleled power. - What will happen to chief corruption-buster Wang Qishan? Speculation has swirled that Wang, 69, could be asked to stay on past an unofficial retirement age limit, either in his current role, or possibly in a new position with an economic portfolio. - Who will be on the new Standing Committee, the apex of power in China? Currently made up of seven men, most of whom are expected to retire and be replaced by new faces. Possible names include Li Shulei, Wang s deputy at the anti-corruption watchdog; the Chongqing party chief Chen Miner, who is close to Xi; and the provincial party boss of Guangdong, Hu Chunhua. If Xi becomes party chairman the significance of the Standing Committee would become diminished, as power would be concentrated in Xi s hands rather than in the Standing Committee. - A series of new personnel appointments, like the foreign minister and central bank chief, will be decided, though some may not be formalized and announced until the annual meeting of parliament in March.  - Changing the party s constitution. Some sort of reference to Xi and his theories will be included in the revised constitution - a further sign of his tightening grip on power. - Bolstering the anti-corruption and security systems. A new National Supervision Commission, which would combine the roles of several party and government bodies that currently combat graft, will likely be set up.  - The National Security Commission, already headed by Xi, could also get new powers, potentially making it more important than the Central Military Commission, which runs the People s Liberation Army. That would give the National Security Commission more power to tackle domestic and foreign threats. The exact role of a more powerful Commission is still unclear, including if it will have overall command of both the military and the domestic security forces. - Whether Xi will anoint a successor. Xi s rise to the top was confirmed at the 2007 Congress, when he first joined the Standing Committee and then became vice president the following year. Any successor would have to join the Standing Committee at this Congress and be young enough to serve at least three five-year terms. If there is no obvious successor, it will increase speculation that Xi could stay on in power after 2022, when the next Congress occurs, and when Xi should, according to precedent and age limits, step down after two terms in office. - Whether Xi reaffirms 2013 reform pledges to let market forces play a  decisive  role in the economy, a catchphrase rarely mentioned now. Signals on new reform initiatives will be important, especially concerning state-owned enterprises, the fiscal system, property taxes and land rights. Also important is if there are any fresh measures to tackle industrial overcapacity and debt issues. Any fresh measures to tackle overcapacity and debt issues. - Any hints on policy priorities for the next five years, both monetary and fiscal, though analysts don t expect the Congress to unveil any major policy changes. Economic and policy agendas for 2018 will be set at the annual economic work conference later this year.  - New expressions on the economy and reforms, following Xi s use of the terms  new normal  to describe the more moderate pace of economic growth, and  supply-side structural reform . - How the punishing war on pollution is affecting China s business and government leaders as they prepare for a tough winter campaign aimed at meeting politically sensitive smog reduction targets. Fighting pollution is now a key criterion on which the performance of officials will be judged. ",worldnews,"October 15, 2017 ",1,4353

And true to form, even after facing tremendous backlash, Trump hasn t learned his lesson and is still going at it.Trump s attacks on the United Nations began the day after Christmas, when he tweeted: The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad! The United Nations promptly responded from the organization s Twitter account, and its response couldn t have been more perfect.

 GOP Senator Says Flynn Stonewalling Russia Investigation,"According to Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Michael Flynn is not willing to cooperate with the committee s investigation into Russian interference in American elections.In an interview with Capitol Hill press on Thursday, Burr told reporters that Flynn s attorneys  have not yet indicated their attentions  to comply with a subpoena, despite the fact that is only  a day or two left  before Flynn will be forced to produce documents and testimony or be held in contempt. Senator Burr was careful to couch his words to maintain an impartial stance, but reporters present said that the senator was clearly upset by Flynn s disregard for the investigation.Burr initially said that Flynn wasn t going to comply with the subpoena, but walked that statement back in order to make it clear that there was still time for his lawyers to reach out to the committee if they chose to do so.Do the MSM think I'm dumb enough 2 accpt their interview rqusts only 2 see my words twisted/spun 2 fit their #fakenews agenda? #WastingTime  I LOVE AMERICA?? (@mflynnJR) May 17, 2017Flynn himself has declined to comment on the investigation altogether, although his son, Michael Flynn Jr. has been talking on Twitter.Refusing to comply with this subpoena will all but disqualify Flynn from the immunity he sought last month, when his lawyer went on Twitter to beg multiple investigations to consider offering it to his client.Immunity from prosecution typically follows a clearly defined legal path, where the guilty party first meets with prosecutors and tells them everything he knows in a sealed session, which gives them time to consider making a deal. This is called a  proffer session  and Flynn has shown no willingness to do it.Instead, it appears as though Flynn and his attorneys expect the senate committee to blindly trust that Flynn has something meaningful to say in exchange for immunity.Judging by Burr s response, the senators aren t biting, and they re starting to lose their patience.

" It’s Happening: Justice Department Appoints Special Counsel For Russia Investigation, Trump FURIOUS","After the nation joined together and demanded a special prosecutor for the Trump/Russia investigation, it happened.Former FBI director Robert Mueller was the second-longest running in history, serving between 2001 and 2013   two years longer than the typical 10-year tenure for his position. My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that prosecution is warranted,  Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein, on whom Trump attempted to blame FBI Director James Comey s firing, said of his decision to appoint special counsel.  I have made no such determination. Rosenstein says that  based on the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command. During his time as FBI director, Mueller taught his agents that  main stream [sic]  Muslims are  radical  and that the more  devout  a Muslim is the more likely he his to be  violent    a view shared by the majority of Republicans.Ultimately, Mueller reports to Rosenstein, who reports to Jeff Sessions, who reports to Donald Trump, but this is the absolute best-case scenario we can hope for in the swampful of corruption that is the Trump administration.It remains to be seen if Mueller, whose conduct as director was called  appalling  and  disgraceful, will be working for the American people or if this is just part of the show.Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 17, 2017",0,1559
"From life as thugs to baking, El Salvador's ex-gang members seek peace","SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Gang life in the poor Central American country of El Salvador is hard, but for a dozen former members of the feared 18th Street Gang, building a new life outside is no less difficult.   Wilfredo Gomez, 40, joined a gang as an adolescent in Los Angeles, the U.S. city to which his parents emigrated. He said he was enticed by the guns, the girls and the camaraderie of gang life.  He wound up in jail before being deported back to his native country. With few links to El Salvador, he quickly returned to gang life. A 10-year jail sentence for stealing an Uzi submachine gun gave him time to reckon with his choices. Returning to civil society is arduous in the midst of the government s militarized battle against the  maras,  which has  led to claims of rights abuses and, according to police, an average daily tally of 16 dead. Former gang members often struggle to find lodging and work, and may be rejected by their families.  For Gomez and 12 other ex-gangsters, the Eben-Ezer evangelical church in the gang-ridden neighborhood of Dina in San Salvador, the capital, has been a lifeline, offering food, accommodations, and a spiritual second chance.   I ve only had losses being part of the gang,  Gomez said.  I haven t won anything. I lost my youth, which was spent in jail. I lost my family due to my bad decisions. I lost my home, my woman, my son, and I lost the best years of my life due to a pointless ideology.  Gomez now runs a bakery that employs 10 other former gang members.  Now, my fun, my enjoyment, is to see them smile, to have dreams,  Gomez said.  They say they re going to open a bigger bakery, and that one day we ll have our own store and compete against Pizza Hut.  Rejected by a society weary of violence, they nonetheless struggle to eradicate the stain of gang life. In October, police went to the bakery and stripped the employees to expose their gang tattoos. They were arrested on suspicion of illicit association, a crime that carries a 5-year sentence. A week later, they were released without charges. Once known as  The Shadow,  Raul Valladares, 34, is undergoing a painful process to remove tattoos from his face and arms. He has received death threats from his former gang associates because removing gang insignia is punishable by death.  It s definitely cost me a lot to leave the gang,  he said.  But I m fighting to keep going.  Related photo essay at reut.rs/2j5X7Oj ",worldnews,"December 15, 2017 ",1,2506
 Lewis Black SLAMS Cruz: He’s So Creepy That No One Notices He’s A Bully Too (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, Lewis Black appeared on Comedy Central s The Nightly Show to hype his ABC special, Madoff, but made sure to take the time to be his lovable, crotchety self. Black says that the most surprising news that arose out of the Iowa caucuses was that Ben Carson seemingly left all of his clothes in Florida and had to fly home to get them. What s surprising is that Ben Carson flew from Iowa to Florida to get a change of clothes,  Black said.  That kind of leads into the other thing   that someone really that batsh*t crazy could score 10 percent in Iowa. Though Black agreed with the rest of the panel that Marco Rubio poses the most severe threat to Hillary Clinton, but Black questioned his ability to actually be President, noting that much of his time in office would be  on the job training  as with Barack Obama   But host Larry Wilmore disagreed, noting that Republicans  racist opposition to every single one of the President s initiatives played a bigger role in stifling any progress Obama may have attempted to make. It was absolutely that, but also it was dealing with   it s the same position of a guy who s in the Senate who hasn t been in the Senate long enough,  But when Wilmore pointed out that Ted Cruz, whose daughter recently snubbed him as he attempted to orchestrate a warm family moment for the cameras, had a similar background to Rubio, it was on. Black pointed out that both Trump and Cruz are bullies, but Cruz is far too creepy to be recognized as just as big a bully as Donald Trump: Here s what Rubio s problem is right now   both Trump and Cruz are both bullies. So I think that they re going to kind of punch him. What I really find interesting about Cruz, after everything else, is that people don t seem to have noticed that he is a bully. Trump is an obvious bully. Cruz is the bully who acts weird, and he s acting weird all the time, and so you end up doing what the weird guy wants you to do so he ll stop acting weird. Trump is such an amazing overbearing asshole that we can t see how creepy Cruz is,  Wilmore added, with Black noting that there s a  touch of ferret  in Cruz s family.Cruz is remembered as the creepy guy in school. His former college roommate, Craig Mazin, is almost addicted to telling people about it on Twitter, noting that the presidential hopeful leaves behind a greasy film on whatever he touches. They even had a nickname for it    Cruhz.  He was also fond of hanging out near the women s restroom in a bathrobe for reasons we would rather not imagine.Of course, it could be said that Trump is creepy, as well, with his numerous remarks about how he wants to sleep with his daughter   and the insanely unsettling ways they pose for photographs, so Cruz does have some competition in that department. At least Cruz can say, completely honestly, that he doesn t want to sleep with his little girl.Watch Black lay the smack down, below:The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore Get More: The Nightly Show Full Episodes,The Nightly Show on Facebook,The Nightly Show Video ArchiveFeatured image via screengrab",News,"February 3, 2016",0,3155
Greek top court to decide Dec. 13 on Russia cyber suspect extradition,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece s Supreme Court will decide on Dec. 13 whether to extradite a Russian to the United States where authorities want to put him on trial for laundering $4 billion via a bitcoin platform. Alexander Vinnik, who says he is a bitcoin consultant, is accused by U.S. authorities of running the BTC-e exchange, which they allege was a conduit for laundering proceeds from illicit activities.  Vinnik denies the charges and is fighting his extradition to the United States.  I don t think there is independent justice in the United States for a Russian citizen,  Vinnik told the court in session in Athens. He also said conditions in American prisons were  terrible . Addressing the court, a Greek public prosecutor recommended Vinnik s extradition. The 38-year-old was arrested in northern Greece on the basis of a U.S. warrant in July, one of seven Russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on U.S. cybercrime charges. Since his arrest, Russia has also sought Vinnik s extradition there on lesser charges of fraud. Vinnik has agreed to be extradited to Russia. In competing requests of this nature, the final decision of where Vinnik will be extradited rests with Greece s justice minister. ",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",1,1285
New Trump travel order will aim to short circuit legal challenges,"(Reuters) - In formulating a new executive order limiting travel to the United States, President Donald Trump has promised to make the directive harder to fight successfully in court than the one he issued in January.  One way the administration will likely try to do that, legal experts say, is to shape the order more narrowly to undercut the opportunity for states and other opponents to sue by showing courts they have “standing,” or the ability to argue the president’s order causes them harm. But legal experts said a new order, which a White House source said was expected this week, was unlikely to fully eliminate the ability of challengers to pursue legal actions.  More than two dozen lawsuits were filed in U.S. courts against the initial travel ban, which temporarily barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In one case, which ultimately got the order temporarily suspended, the state of Washington claimed standing in part because the ban affected Washington residents living and working legally in the United States as permanent residents known as green card holders.  By excluding legal permanent residents from a new order, something the administration has said is likely, the president would make it harder for opponents to challenge the ban. Larry Klayman, founder of the conservative advocacy group Freedom Watch, said that with a narrower order, legal standing could be a real problem for potential challengers. “If you’re not a citizen, or if you’re not a permanent resident, you have no constitutional rights,” Klayman said. Trump has said travel limitations are necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. Americans were deeply divided over the measure, which had some support but was condemned by prominent U.S. companies and allies. The initial order caused chaos at airports, as people,  including green card holders initially, were temporarily blocked from entering the United States.  Some of those people, and several states, challenged the order. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruling in the Washington case, said the ban likely violated the state’s due process rights and suspended it.  The 9th Circuit also ruled that Washington had legal standing to challenge the ban, over objections from the Department of Justice.  Stephen Legomsky, former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Barack Obama, said a narrower ban “weakens the arguments for standing but doesn’t entirely eliminate them.” Legomsky noted that, “in general the Constitution does not apply to people outside the United States, but that is not iron clad.”  A U.S. citizen whose spouse was barred from visiting by the order, for instance, could argue that he or she had standing to challenge it. Or a state university might argue that the order negatively affected it.  In its ruling, the 9th Circuit said Washington state had standing because it was harmed by Trump’s order, specifically noting that faculty at the state’s universities from those seven countries would be prohibited from traveling for research or academic collaboration.  “The universities’ reputations depend on the success of their professors’ research,” the court wrote. The one thing legal experts on all sides of the issue agree on is that the new order will be challenged in courts.  “No matter what they do there will be litigation,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr. He said he thinks it likely challengers will be able to establish standing, leaving the courts to decide whether the ban is legal. At that point, Yale-Loehr says, the wording of the new order will become crucial. “If they limit the executive order to people who have never been to the U.S. before, they might win on the merits eventually,” he said.

AL GORE DECLINES ENDORSEMENT OF HILLARY FOR NOW…WHAT’S HE WAITING FOR?,"It s too early to endorse Hillary? What s Al Gore waiting for? It s clear that Hillary is the anointed one for the Democrats so why would he wait and who would he be waiting for if not HRC?Al Gore declined to back Hillary Clinton for president when asked who he thinks would be next in the White House.When questioned by WPP founder Sir Martin Sorrell at the Cannes Lions festival of creativity about whom he would back for 2016, Gore   Bill Clinton s vice president from 1993 to 2001  notably didn t take the chance to praise Hillary. In a packed Cannes Lions session Friday, Sorrell asked Gore,  Would you refuse to answer the question [who will be the next president of the United States]?  Gore responded,  I wouldn t refuse to answer that question, I would try to cleverly dodge the question   I would say it s actually too early.  Gore merely smiled, but didn t comment further, after Sorrell added,  I think Hillary will win and it would be great to have a female president of the most powerful nation on the planet.  Gore has reportedly had a complicated relationship with the Clintons since 2000. Political insiders speculate Gore may be remaining neutral for now but would eventually back the Democratic nominee. Gore last October described Hillary in an interview with Bloomberg as an  extremely capable person,  adding she did an excellent job as secretary of state and a New York senator.

"North Korea can learn from Iran nuclear deal, U.S. says","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea, which conducted a fourth nuclear test in January in contravention of U.N. Security Council resolutions, can learn from a deal struck between Iran and world powers to freeze its nuclear program, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. North Korea, which regularly threatens the United States and rich, democratic South Korea, also conducted a long-range rocket launch in February, defying U.N. sanctions. The Security Council last month expanded those sanctions aimed at starving North Korea of funds for its weapons program on a resolution drafted by the United States and China. “Iran made a fundamental choice. It decided to freeze and roll back its nuclear program and allow inspectors to come in and create the time and space to see if we could agree a comprehensive agreement,” Blinken told reporters in Seoul. Iran and six world powers clinched the nuclear agreement in July 2015, which allowed for the easing of sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.     “It’s our hope that the DPRK will be inspired by that example,” said Blinken, speaking after a meeting with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts. DPRK stands for Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official title.   Recent diplomatic progress between the United States and Cuba and Myanmar demonstrated U.S. willingness to engage with countries like North Korea, Blinken said. “If a country, even one with which we’ve had the most profound differences, is prepared to engage seriously and credibly in answering the demands of the international community, we are also prepared to engage,” Blinken said. Blinken said on Monday the United States would respond strongly in the case of a further North Korean nuclear test, days after the North’s failed attempt to launch what the United States believes was an intermediate-range ballistic missile.

One Person MURDERED Every 14 Hours In Obama’s GUN-FREE Hometown…Black Chicago Residents Speak Out: “My Life Has Been Hurt By Democrats” [VIDEO],"69 people were shot in gun-free Chicago over this past Memorial Day weekend. Meanwhile Barack Obama is busy working with Black Lives Matter terror groups to point fingers at law enforcement and white people for the crisis majority black neighborhoods are facing in their communities. When will the media start exposing the truth about gun-free zones in America? It should be clear to every American that violent gun related crimes don t stop because you put up a gun-free zone sign in a neighborhood filled with bad guys.Instead of focusing on broken families, elected Democrats have been ignoring these communities for decades in favor of kickbacks and favors from vendors and contractors and in many cases, outright theft from money that was designated for local schools or community improvement projects. Unless and until someone gets serious about finding jobs for blacks and cutting off welfare funding as a reward for teenage and single moms to have multiple children, this problem will only get worse. Children need a father in the home period.Here are a few crime statistics that prove most of the crime victims in the gun-free city of Chicago are black males. Black on black crimes are the biggest issue these communities face, yet Obama and race baiters for hire across America have magically turned the argument around and are blaming Whites and cops for the huge uptick in violence in these mostly black neighborhoods.Sadly, a large number of the crimes have gone unsolved, as people who live in these neighborhoods don t want to rat out the killers. (Note the number of shootings where police were involved vs. the number of shootings between citizens HELLO Black Lives Matter!)Here s what black Chicago residents really think of their Democrat leaders, including the former Chicago community organizer/hustler, Barack Hussein Obama. They explain how Democrats are really the people responsible for perpetuating black on black crime:BLOODY MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND:Just after midnight, in one of the last shootings of the Memorial Day weekend, two people pulled out guns and started firing in East Garfield Park.The first call to police early Tuesday was for one person shot on Homan Avenue. Then a second victim. Then a third. Then someone walked into a hospital a few minutes later.In all, 27 of the 69 people hit by gunfire over the weekend were shot in or near the Harrison District, one of the city s most violent and one of the most heavily patrolled by police.So many people were shot there that Deputy Superintendent John Escalante promised Sunday to beef up patrols. Nine more people were shot there by early Tuesday.The breakdown from the weekend is: Three people killed and 12 people wounded Friday afternoon through early Saturday; one person killed and 24 people wounded Saturday evening through early Sunday; 13 people wounded Sunday afternoon through early Monday; and 16 people shot Monday into early Tuesday, two of them fatally.Here s a SHOCKING 30 DAY Stupidity Trend from HeyJackass.comThe holiday weekend was police Superintendent Eddie Johnson s first since Mayor Rahm Emanuel picked the veteran cop to lead the embattled department in late March. The department sought volunteers to work overtime over the weekend, although police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi did not release figures on how many officers worked. Instead of hiring more cops during a city budget crunch, Emanuel instead has relied heavily on overtime to try to tamp down violence. Via: Chicago TribuneWith the constant bashing of law enforcement by Black Lives Matter terrorists, coupled with the desire by Barack Obama and AG Loretta Lynch to tie the hands of cops across America, it should come as no surprise that cops are no longer willing to go the extra mile to protect those who would like to see them harmed.Question: How much on average does it cost for each gunshot victim in Chicago in 2016?Answer: An ASTOUNDING $68,683* per person*Costs assume the following:$55,000: Average gunshot victim ER and hospital expenses. $1000: Average CFD ambulance ride, only applicable to 80% of victims, rest self-transport. $800: Homicide-related autopsies. Doesn t include hospice care or ongoing rehabilitation. Cost estimates provided by Chicago Killings Cost $2.5 Billion. ",politics,"Jun 1, 2016",0,4413

Former Trump campaign staffer files discrimination complaint: NYT,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A 26-year-old former campaign staffer for Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has accused the campaign of sex discrimination, the New York Times reported on Sunday. Elizabeth Mae Davidson, who worked as an organizer in Iowa for the New York businessman, filed a complaint with the Davenport, Iowa, Civil Rights Commission, claiming female staffers were paid less than male staffers, according to the report. She claimed her requests to plan and speak at Trump’s campaign rallies were ignored while her male peers were allowed to do so, it said. Davidson also claimed that Trump had addressed her and a young female volunteer with a remark that referred to the women’s appearances, saying “you guys could do a lot of damage,” the Times report said. According to the Times, Trump, in an interview on Sunday, denied having made the remark to the two women. He did not address the other two allegations, the Times said, and he said he did not remember Davidson but had been told she had done “a terrible job” while working on the campaign. Davidson, who was fired on Jan. 14, and her lawyer Dorothy O’Brien did not respond to requests for comment.  Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said the campaign had not been notified that a complaint had been filed.  “These claims from a disgruntled former part-time employee are without merit,” Hicks said. “She is in violation of her contract and continues to disparage the campaign with falsehoods, which, in addition to doing a terrible job, is why she was terminated weeks ago.”  (Reporting By Emily Flitter; Editing by Dan Grebler) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",politicsNews,"February 1, 2016 ",1,1776
Democrats seek probe of Trump donation to Florida attorney general,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida Democrats demanded investigations on Tuesday into a donation made by a Donald Trump foundation to the state’s attorney general, citing an Associated Press report that the Republican attorney general solicited the money around the time her office was considering a lawsuit against Trump University. At question is a 2013 donation of $25,000 from a Trump charity to a political committee supporting the attorney general, Pam Bondi, that has received media scrutiny this year.  “Florida’s top law enforcement official solicited a donation from someone she was supposed to be investigating for fraud,” Florida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tant said in a statement. “She even went as far as to campaign for Trump, who has made a habit of bragging about buying politicians. Floridians deserve answers and Pam Bondi must be held accountable,” Tant added. Bondi, who has endorsed Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, on Tuesday called the AP report misleading. “My office has made public every document on this issue, which shows no one in my office ever opened an investigation on Trump University nor was there a basis for doing so,” she said in a statement. “Any news story that suggests otherwise is completely false.”  The Trump campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The Associated Press reported on Monday that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join a New York state investigation into Trump’s defunct real estate training school. Trump is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaire’s real estate investment strategies. Bondi ended the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived, the AP reported. At the time of the donation, she was seeking re-election. The Tampa Bay Times quoted a Bondi spokesman saying on Monday that documents released in the case “consistently demonstrate that through due diligence, staff assessed matters brought to their attention and properly determined that New York litigation seeks relief for any and all aggrieved consumers, regardless of their state of residence.”  ",politicsNews,"June 7, 2016 ",1,2332

Obama asks for $11.6 billion more in supplemental defense budget,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday sent a request to Congress for an additional $11.6 billion in supplemental war-related funding, which would include money to fight Islamic State militants and sustain high overseas troop levels. The request, detailed in a letter released by the White House, seeks an additional $5.8 billion for the Pentagon for military operations in Afghanistan and fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and an $5.8 billion for the State Department and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for fiscal 2017. Obama made the request just before Congress returns to Washington for its “lame duck” session before the new Congress starts in January. “For the Department of Defense, this plan reflects the evolving nature of our military campaign against ISIL and our efforts in Afghanistan,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Carter added that the funding would also allow the State Department and USAID to counter extremism. “Swift passage of this plan will help the Department of Defense and our partners in the U.S. government and around the world protect this nation, and I urge Congress to support it,” the statement said.  U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, the chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said he would review President Barack Obama’s request but that it was too low. “While we will review the request carefully, the amount still does not accommodate the increased pace of operations against ISIL and does nothing to begin addressing the readiness crisis,” Thornberry said in a statement.

China disputes Trump's claims of fentanyl 'flood' into United States,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s drug control agency disputed on Friday U.S. President Donald Trump s claim that most of the synthetic drug fentanyl at the heart of the U.S. opioid crisis was produced in China. Declaring the crisis a public health emergency, U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he would discuss as a  top priority  stopping the  flood of cheap and deadly  fentanyl  manufactured in China  when he meets President Xi Jinping during his state visit to Beijing next week. Wei Xiaojun, the deputy secretary-general of China s National Narcotics Commission, said China did not  deny or reject  that some fentanyl produced in China had made its way to the United States. But the  intelligence and information exchanged between China and the United States is not enough to say that most of the fentanyl or other opioid substances originate from China , Wei said at a joint news briefing with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Beijing. Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl last year, surpassing common painkillers and heroin for the first time. American law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the United States, as well as precursor chemicals, originate from China.   While Chinese officials dispute these claims, Beijing has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of synthetic drugs, and has placed fentanyl and 22 other related compounds on its list of controlled substances. It had done so even though fentanyl was not widely abused in China, Wei said, primarily in the spirit of cooperating with the United States and the broader international community.  China and the United States have increased cooperation on drug control in recent years and are holding a bilateral meeting on the issue this week. The DEA opened its second country office in southern Guangzhou in January.  Lance Ho, who heads the DEA s Country Office in Beijing, said the cooperation between the two countries had generated good  momentum  and was focused on improving the real-time sharing of information.   Once China controls a substance it has a dramatic effect on the United States in terms of lives saved,  Ho said.   The U.S. Department of Justice indicted two major Chinese drug traffickers last month on charges of making illegal versions of fentanyl and selling the highly addictive drug to Americans over the internet and through international mail. Wei said it was  regrettable  that the United States decided to announce the case  unilaterally  because it would affect China s ongoing investigations. ",worldnews,"November 3, 2017 ",1,2844

"'We like Paris but are a bit scared,' Chinese tourists say after muggings","PARIS (Reuters) - In tight-knit groups with their backpacks hanging in front where they can keep an eye on them, Chinese tourists walked around Paris on their guard on Monday, alarmed by a recent mugging and other attacks targeting Asian visitors.  We like Paris but we are a bit scared,  Chinese tour guide Jenny Xu said as she lead a group around the department store district hours after China s foreign ministry said France needed to step up security after a high-profile robbery.  Chinese tourists, they are afraid for their safety in Paris,  said Xu, speaking in English as she recounted some of her own clients experiences of being mugged in shops or museums.   We tell them again and again to have their bags in front of them. And I tell them not to take so much cash.   France has in the past promised to do more to protect the safety of Chinese tourists, who come to Paris in ever larger numbers and have become more of a target for the cash they often carry and the luxury goods they buy. Last week, a group of 40 Chinese tourists was tear-gassed and robbed by four men in the parking lot of their hotel near Orly airport, south of Paris. While the muggings are not good for the city s reputation, and tourism was hit hard by the Islamist attacks of 2015, Paris still attracted 16 million visitors in the first half of 2017, making it one of the most popular cities in the world.          Chang Hui Ying, a tour operator from Taiwan who leads Chinese and Taiwanese groups across Europe, said Paris was the city where she was most worried about client safety.  One hour ago, when I was leaving the Louvre museum, two girls opened my bag and I was almost robbed,  she said, adding that once a whole week s worth of wages was stolen from her bag in the French capital.   There really are a lot of thieves,  she said.  But they still want to come. We like to shop here,  she said as she led a group to a store especially dedicated to Chinese visitors which the Galeries Lafayette chain opened earlier this year.  Tourists said they were taking extra precautions.   We put a small wallet somewhere and more money deeper inside (our bag), and the bag always in front,  said Chang Hui-Neng, speaking English with the help of her guide.  A group of hoteliers deplored last week s mugging and called for more protection.  More needs to be done to avoid such tragic events that have a lot of impact on Paris  image and that of France as a tourism destination,  UMIH said in a statement. With no backpack or shopping bags that would mark her as a tourist, 23-year-old Chinese student Wang Xi Qing, who has been living in France for 18 months, said she knew here way around and felt comfortable. But she said she tells friends who visit to be careful, especially since one of them got mugged in Notre Dame cathedral.  It s important to be aware,  she said. ",worldnews,"November 6, 2017 ",1,2929

"HP CEO Whitman compares Trump to Hitler, Mussolini","(Reuters) - Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co chief executive and Republican donor Meg Whitman reiterated her opposition to Donald Trump as the party’s presidential nominee and compared him to fascist leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, according to media and two sources. Whitman made the comment Friday at a conference hosted by previous Republican nominee Mitt Romney, while she challenged U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan on his endorsement of Trump, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Two participants at the off-the-record session in Park City, Utah confirmed Whitman’s language to Reuters. Whitman could not immediately be reached for comment.      A billionaire and former supporter of failed candidate New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Whitman has been actively working to stop Trump’s nomination, including fundraising for an anti-Trump Super PAC.  In February, the technology CEO called Trump “unfit” to be president. Since then, Trump has become the presumptive Republican nominee and is likely to run against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Ryan, addressing the 300 attendees of the session, explained the difficulty he had with the decision to endorse, the Post said, including weathering pressure from House Republicans to lend his backing to Trump.   After weeks of holding out, Ryan endorsed the New York businessman in early June, breaking with a number of establishment Republicans who see Trump’s rhetoric as damaging to the party. The opponents include Romney, Republicans’ 2012 presidential nominee, who chose Ryan as his running mate. Romney has blasted Trump in recent weeks for attacks he has made on the Mexican-American judge presiding over a case against him, with Romney warning on Friday about the effect that “trickle-down racism” could have on the country. As the presumptive nominee, Trump now has to balance maintaining the outsider style that helped propel him to the nomination, while courting Republican insiders, who could be critical to financing a general election campaign against a well-funded Clinton.  Trump on Saturday showed no inclination to make peace with his critics. He went on Twitter to note how Romney “choked like a dog” when he lost to then-incumbent President Barack Obama in 2012 and reiterated it at his campaign stops.

Pope prays for nuclear disarmament,"MILAN (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday called on world leaders to work in favor of nuclear disarmament to protect human rights, particularly those of weaker and underprivileged people. The pontiff said that there was a need to  work with determination to build a world without nuclear weapons , speaking from the window of the papal apartment overlooking St. Peter s Square and citing his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si (Praised Be). His remarks came on the day that the group which won this year s Nobel Peace Prize urged nuclear nations to adopt a U.N. treaty banning atomic weapons. With rising tensions between the United States and North Korea, the pope has repeatedly warned against the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of nuclear devices and has called for a third country to mediate the dispute. At his weekly Angelus prayer, Pope Francis added that men and women in the world had  the liberty, the intelligence and the capacity to guide technology, limit their power, at the service of peace and true progress . Speaking aboard the plane back from his trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh, the pope suggested that some world leaders had an  irrational  attitude toward nuclear weapons. Last month he appeared to harden the Catholic Church s teaching against nuclear weapons, saying countries should not stockpile them, even for the purpose of deterrence. Pope Francis, a strong defender of environmental protection,  also hoped that an upcoming Paris summit would adopt  efficient decisions  to contrast climate change.

Factbox: Key figures in Austria's new coalition government,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s center-right People s Party (OVP) led by Sebastian Kurz and the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) have agreed to form a coalition government. The deal marks a major victory for a European far-right party after a flurry of elections this year, in which right-wing parties have made gains but failed to enter coalitions elsewhere in Western Europe. Here are the main figures in the new government:  Kurz became a conservative junior minister at 23, Europe s youngest foreign minister at 27 and leader of the People s Party at 30, moving it further to the right of the political spectrum. He has yet to complete his law degree while he pursues politics. An early critic of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s open-border policy as Europe s migration crisis escalated in 2015, he infuriated Berlin when he spearheaded the closure of the Balkan route into Europe.  Known for his slicked-back hair, he speaks eloquently but often eschews discussing policy details in public. He won October s parliamentary elections promising to break with Austria s decades-old political consensus which shares  power among conservatives, Social Democrats, labor and employer associations. HEINZ-CHRISTIAN STRACHE (FPO), VICE-CHANCELLOR The 48-year-old former dental technician is the longest-serving party chief in Austria and enters government for the first time.  During the campaign he accused Kurz of stealing the FPO s ideas, but Strache toned down his rhetoric during coalition negotiations stressing joint political targets. Strache is keen on ridding his party of its neo-Nazi image, portraying it as a mainstream defender of the middle class. He has called for  zero immigration  and wants to ban political Islam.    The multilingual Middle East and international law expert got her new job on an FPO ticket. She has never been a member of the FPO, which has expressed sympathy for Israel s desire to host embassies in Jerusalem and has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin s party. Kneissl, 52, has criticized Merkel s open-door policy toward refugees and has called the European Union s migrant deal with Turkey  nonsense  in newspaper comments. Kneissl, who owns a farm in Lower Austria province, worked in the foreign ministry under a conservative minister in the 1990s. The Freedom Party s general secretary is seen as its mastermind and powerbroker who wields influence in all party matters.  The 49-year-old future police supremo, who started his career as speechwriter for charismatic late FPO chief Joerg Haider, is known for his sharp tongue. The political hardliner has been a member of parliament for more than a decade.  The hardliner inherits a legal dispute with Europe s largest aerospace company Airbus over a 2003 fighter jet purchase and will soon have to decide how to modernize the neutral country s aerial defenses.     Kunasek, 41, called for a night-time curfew for asylum seekers in 2016 and curbing asylum seekers  access to health services in 2015, according to human rights group SOS Mitmensch.     Last year, he published an article in Die Aula, a magazine linked to Austria s right-wing extremist scene, according to the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance that researches the far right. Loeger has no university degree, but over 30 years of experience in the insurance sector, where he has been the chief executive of Uniqa s Austrian unit since 2013.    The 52-year-old manager, a surprise ministerial appointee who has not held public office before, enjoys sports and art. A close ally of Kurz s, whom he knows from their time in the conservatives  youth wing, 36-year-old Bluemel studied philosophy in Austria and France, focusing on  Christian social teachings .  After various posts in the party he became chief of the conservatives in Vienna, a traditional Social Democratic stronghold, in 2015. He is in charge of the party s media portfolio.

Britons who join Islamic State should be hunted and killed: defence minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britons who have joined the Islamic State militant group in Syria and Iraq should be hunted down and killed, Britain s new defence minister said. Gavin Williamson said that Britons who had gone to Syria or Iraq to fight for Islamic State hated what Britain stands for, and that air strikes could be used against the estimated 270 British citizens who are still out there.  Quite simply my view is a dead terrorist can t cause any harm to Britain,  Williamson told the Daily Mail in an interview published late on Wednesday.  We should do everything we can do to destroy and eliminate that threat,  he said, adding that he believed any British fighters who joined Islamic State should never be allowed to return to the United Kingdom. Williamson, 41, has been defence minister for little over a month, replacing Michael Fallon after he quit in a sexual harassment scandal. Prominent British militants such as Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, and Sally Jones, have been reportedly killed by British or U.S. forces since travelling to fight for Islamic State. After the death of Jones, who was known as the  White Widow , Fallon said that British nationals who chose to leave the UK and fight for Islamic State were a  legitimate target .

 GOP Congressman Secretly Scrubbed This Embarrassing Info From His Wikipedia Page (IMAGE),"A Republican member of Congress was caught scrubbing his Wikipedia page of potentially embarrassing information, including his affiliation with a cult. Rep. David Jolly s (FL) congressional campaign was caught in the act. Jolly is running to replace Senator Marco Rubio after his failed presidential campaign.A spokesman for Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that the campaign removed certain information, including references to the Church of Scientology, that once appeared on Jolly s Wikipedia page.Spokeswoman Sarah Bascom confirmed to BuzzFeed that the campaign took off parts of the Wikipedia entry that told of Jolly s ties to Scientology. The campaign also removed references to Jolly s past career as a lobbyist and his past positions on gay marriage, according to the report.Jolly told a local newspaper the attempt to hide the information was a  careless staff mistake,  but the incident follows a pattern of politicians and their underlings attempting to remove information from the heavily trafficked encyclopedia site. Corporations have also previously been caught attempting to remove unflattering information or add PR fluff to the site as well.The information Jolly tried to remove has been restored, with a sentence noting:Jolly s relationship with the Church of Scientology, which is based inside his congressional district in Clearwater, Florida, has been reported on in the press, including Jolly s attendance at various fundraising events hosted by the organization.Via TheLipTV, here is the invitation for the Scientology fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi involving David Jolly that his campaign tried to hide:David Jolly Scientology InvitationThe Daily Beast reported on Jolly s ties to Scientology in a story headlined  Scientology Could Get Its Own Senator.  In addition to Jolly s fundraising connection to the group, his wife was slated to be a model in a charity fashion show for the group, and the treasurer for his PAC is on the board of a group founded by Scientologists.Jolly is perhaps trying to avoid connections to Scientology due to their well-documented history of harassment campaigns against defectors, practices involving disconnecting members from their families, or their belief in alien involvement in world affairs.Featured image via screencapture",News,"April 6, 2016",0,2417

However, the stories are remarkably similar, and they reflect Trump s own words on the now-infamous Access Hollywood tape where he bragged to then-host Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women. Well, on Thursday, those issues deepened, as a 12th woman came forward.Ninni Laaksonen once held the title of Miss Finland. Speaking with Finnish tabloid Ilta-Sanomat, she says that Trump touched her rear end inappropriately in 2006, where the pageant participants were doing an episode of The Late Show with David Letterman. Laaksonen says: Before the show we were photographed outside the building. Trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought,  What is happening? What is most interesting here is the fact that this young woman didn t go out of her way to go public with these allegations. The paper she spoke with, which is supposedly the second-biggest publication in all of Finland, went looking for women in the nation who had histories with Trump. That is how Laaksonen was found, which makes her allegations against Trump all the more credible. She didn t go looking to attach her name to this scandal unfolding in the United States presidential election, but that is what happened, just because she chose to be brave.Perhaps the grossest part of all of this is what Laaksonen says someone told her regarding Trump s attraction to her: Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger. This is just disgusting. The GOP really should be addressing this with the public. They are literally trying to put a sexual predator in the Oval Office. This just goes to show that they do not care about the women of this country, or about the nation itself at all. They care about their party and their careers, and that s it.Hopefully, more women are found between now and election day, and they won t be able to be ignored.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 27, 2016",0,2231

Mainstream Media Spreads Huge Lie GOP Official Refused Donations for #Houston Relief [Video],"The usual mainstream media suspects are at it again with their fake news reports. Shameless lefty news outlets made up a false story claiming the Texas SOS Rolando Pablos refused aid for Houston Hurricane Harvey victims and instead asked for prayers.The story spread from one sentence in an article from Canada s CBC News: Pablos declined the aid for now, instead asking for  prayers from the people of Quebec,'  the article quotes Quebec s International Relations Minister Christine St-Pierre to have said.  He was very touched by the fact we called him. The CBC has not corrected the lie! Please send feedback (it took me a minute to do so) to them.

CBC confirmed that they had misreported the interview. Contrary to what has been reported in the media, Secretary Pablos did not decline the minister s offer, but instead made sure Quebec made contact with the proper Texas state agency,  a spokeswoman said.  The Quebec Government s office in Houston is in constant contact with local authorities and is arranging for emergency supplies to be shipped shortly.

Apple shares are one reason hedge funds lag mutual funds in 2016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds may have taken too big a bite of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  Shares of the iPhone maker are one of the biggest bets among hedge funds, with 47 of them listing Apple among their ten largest holdings as of the end of 2015, according to a report from Goldman Sachs on March 18. At the same time, mutual funds are going the opposite direction: Apple is their second-largest underweight holding, meaning the funds invest less of their portfolio in the company than its percentage weighting in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The difference of opinion on Apple, with shares flat year to date, is one reason hedge funds are again lagging. The average hedge fund was down 3.3 percent through February, while the average large-cap core mutual fund fell just 0.8 percent, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar.  Mutual funds, meanwhile, have benefited from being overweight in Facebook Inc (FB.O), CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), according to Goldman.  Mutual fund managers believe Apple no longer enjoys the outsized prospects it had in the past. “We’ve done very well with this company for a long time but it’s so large now that it’s becoming impossible for it to move the needle meaningfully” in terms of revenue growth or profits, said one fund manager from a well-known firm. The manager, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, sold all of his shares in the company.  Shares of Apple fell 6.5 percent on Jan. 27, the day after the company reported its slowest-ever rise in iPhone shipments and forecast quarterly sales declining for the first time in 13 years. The stock dipped 0.7 percent to $105.32 on Thursday.   With the higher concentration of hedge funds owning the stock, Apple should brace for more activist calls to raise its dividend, offer more share buybacks, or acquire more companies to increase short-term returns, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. “Your typical mutual fund manager is going to have more patience than your typical hedge fund manager, who if they have a sizeable stake are going to push for structural or corporate changes to enhance shareholder value,” he said.  Hedge fund Bridgewater Associates increased its stake in Apple by 19 percent during the fourth quarter of 2015, while Tiger Global Management initiated a position, buying 10.6 million shares in the same period, according to SEC filings. At the same time, well-known activists such as Carl Icahn and David Einhorn have trimmed their positions..  Hedge fund manager Morris Mark, whose firm Mark Asset Management oversees $500 million in assets, said he is maintaining a large position in Apple, even as the shares flat line. He sees the iPhone as the gateway into new home-based products.  “They’re going to come out with more services layered on top of this incredible franchise, and you are going to see their entire ecosystem grow,” he said.

Colombia's Senate approves peace tribunals for ex-rebels,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s Senate has backed a law to regulate transitional justice under the country s peace deal with Marxist FARC rebels, including special tribunals that will try guerrilla leaders for war crimes.  The law, approved late on Wednesday, is considered the cornerstone of the agreement signed last year between the government and the FARC, known then as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The measure still needs approval from the lower house of Congress, which is likely to vote on it early next week. The special courts will mete out alternative sentences like landmine removal for ex-guerrilla leaders who are convicted of war crimes. Under the peace deal, those convicted will not serve time in traditional jails. The law can also apply to members of the military and civilians who funded illegal groups like paramilitaries. Congress has until the end of the month to approve the law using the court-approved  fast-track  mechanism to reduce the number of required debates in an effort to implement the peace accord as quickly as possible. In a move that invigorated the previously slow debate in the Senate chamber, the nation s top court ruled this week that the majority of the law, including provisions that allow former rebels to participate in politics, is constitutional.  The court made several modifications however. A provision in the agreement prohibits extradition of former FARC members, but the ruling said that only applied to crimes that occurred before the deal. It said ex-rebels who commit crimes after demobilization would be subject to regular laws that include the possibility of extradition.  That did not sit well with the FARC, which is now officially a political party.  The extradition prohibition as it stands in the final accord is a right and not a benefit,  senior FARC member Ivan Marquez told journalists on Thursday.  Making the prohibition ineffectual constitutes a flagrant and very grave non-compliance with the deal.  Under the agreement the FARC will have 10 guaranteed seats in Congress until 2026. The group has already announced a slate of candidates for elections next year. ",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1,2206
IF THESE CELEBRITIES ARE “With Her” Then Why Is Hillary Paying Them Big Bucks After Performing At Fundraisers?,"Hillary gives pay-to-play a whole new meaning Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Tony Bennett all have one thing in common every one of them got paid after performing to raise money for Hillary. So are they  with her  or are they only  with her  if she pays up?  Of course, this begs the question,  besides Chelsea, is anybody really  with Hillary ? Pop star Lady Gaga cashed a $21,000 check from Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign, campaign finance records show.Gaga is a public backer of Clinton, and performed at a fundraiser for the former secretary of state at Manhattan s luxurious Plaza Hotel in June 2015, an event that carried a price tag of $2,700 per head.During the fundraiser, Clinton snapped a picture alongside Gaga and singer Tony Bennett, who also performed at the event. The picture shows Gaga holding up a shirt that read,  Yaaas Hillary!  Hillary posted the photo to her Instagram account.Two months after the event, on Aug. 25, 2015, Hillary for American made a $21,088 payment to Mermaid Touring Inc. for  event production  in Los Angeles, California. The company is registered in the state of New York and lists Stefani Germanotta, the birth name of Lady Gaga, as its chief executive officer.Gaga urged her New York-based fans on Twitter to get out and vote for Clinton in the Democratic primaries. Hillary for America s New York primary day blog highlighted the tweet on its website.Tony Bennett, also an open Clinton backer, called the Democratic candidate the  most qualified person to ever run for president  shortly before the New York primaries. He has received two separate payments from the Clinton campaign, Federal Election Commission records show.The first check to Bennett was dated for July 17, 2015 in the amount of $2,052 for  event production  purposes and came one month after the fundraiser.On Jan. 7, 2016 nearly seven months after the fundraiser another check was cut to Bennett in the amount of $4,421, also for  event production. This is not the first time that a celebrity who publicly backs Clinton has received payments from her campaign.The Washington Free Beacon previously reported that pop star Katy Perry s company, Kitty Purry, Inc., was given $70,000 from Hillary for America.In total, $97,561 in payments was dished out between Gaga, Bennett, and Perry from the campaign.Clinton s campaign did not return a request for comment on why the payment was issued to Gaga by press time.

Highlights: The Trump presidency on April 28 at 8:45 P.M. EDT/0045 GMT April 29,"(Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday: The Trump administration could respond to North Korea’s latest failed missile test by speeding plans for new U.S. sanctions against Pyongyang, including possible measures against specific North Korean and Chinese entities, a U.S. official says. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warns failure to curb North Korea’s nuclear and missile development could lead to “catastrophic consequences” while China and Russia rebuke Washington for its threat of force. Trump signs a bill approved by the Republican-led Congress to avert a U.S. government shutdown and give lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through Sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved. Trump pledges to uphold Americans’ right to possess guns in a speech that he uses to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.” Trump tells Reuters he will either renegotiate or terminate what he calls a “horrible” free trade deal with South Korea and says Seoul should pay for a U.S. anti-missile system he prices at $1 billion. A 5-year-old U.S.-South Korean trade deal could be improved to increase access for American vehicles and deter currency manipulation but changes will not necessarily shrink the U.S. trade deficit with the Asian export powerhouse. OBAMA-ERA REGULATIONS Lawmakers, lobbyists and interest groups are making a final push in their fight over regulations enacted during former President Barack Obama’s last months in office, with the financial services industry working hard to kill a rule on retirement plans run by states. Trump signs an executive order to extend offshore oil and gas drilling to areas that have been off limits — a move meant to boost domestic production but that could fall flat due to weak industry demand for the acreage. A U.S. appeals court grants a Trump administration request to put on hold a legal challenge by industry and a group of states to Obama administration regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, rules Trump is moving to undo. In an unexpected triumph for privacy advocates, the U.S. National Security Agency says it has stopped a form of surveillance that allowed warrant-less collection of the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages.

U.S. securities regulator says 'disappointed' by retirement advice rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The sole Republican member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Michael Piwowar, expressed deep skepticism about a retirement advice rule that the Labor Department released on Wednesday, a sign of potential conflict over the long-awaited regulation. “I am disappointed that the rule announced today seems to ignore the chorus of voices that questioned whether it will restrict middle-class families’ and minority communities’ access to professional financial advice by making retirement advice unaffordable,” Piwowar, an SEC commissioner, said in a statement.  “I am fearful that those concerns, which were widely and bipartisanly held, will prove to be true once the rule becomes effective.”    The SEC, the country’s chief securities regulator has been crafting its own rule on retirement advice for years. Some lawmakers and industry members had said that the Labor Department, which oversees retirement laws, should hold off until that rule was finalized. Under the Labor rule that takes full effect Jan. 1, 2018, brokers would have to follow a fiduciary standard, acting in clients’ best interests when advising about retirement accounts. It aims to end potential conflicts of interest by brokers who advise on individual retirement accounts, and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products. But after a draft was released last year, members of both political parties, along with financial services firms, expressed concern that the rule would drive up costs and put professional advice out of reach for middle and lower-income people.

Outgoing U.S. envoy says U.N. needs to 'push' Iran on arms embargo,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council needs to push Iran to abide by an arms embargo, outgoing U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said on Wednesday amid U.N. concerns that Tehran has supplied weapons and missiles to Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah. Most U.N. sanctions were lifted a year ago under a deal Iran made with Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, the United States and the European Union to curb its nuclear program. But Iran is still subject to an arms embargo and other restrictions, which are not technically part of the nuclear agreement. In her last appearance at a public Security Council meeting before U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration steps aside on Friday, Power said that recognizing “progress on Iran’s nuclear issues should not distract this council from Iran’s other actions that continue to destabilize the Middle East.”Under a Security Council resolution enshrining the 2015 deal, the U.N. secretary-general is required to report every six months on any violations of sanctions still in place. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman briefed the 15-member council on the second U.N. report and said there had been no reports of nuclear-related or ballistic missile-related violations of the council resolution. However, the report expressed concern that Iran may have violated the resolution by supplying arms to Hezbollah. Iran’s senior nuclear negotiator said in 2015 that Tehran had no intention of complying with the arms embargo or ballistic missile restrictions. “We on the council need to come together to push Iran to effectively implement the binding provisions of resolution 2231 - especially restrictions that ban Iran’s export of arms and related material,” said Power. She did not specify how. The council could impose further sanctions over breaches of the arms embargo, but Russia and China - which are council veto powers along with the United States, France and Britain - were unlikely to agree to such a move, diplomats said. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the nuclear agreement or seek a better deal. Trump’s nominee to replace Power, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, said it would be better to review the deal rather than withdraw from it. She also told lawmakers at her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday that Iran should be held accountable for sanctions violations. She said: “Anytime that we put sanctions forward we should follow through on those when there are violations.” ",politicsNews,"January 18, 2017 ",1,2571
 REPORT: Ivanka Trump Took Kellyanne Conway To The Woodshed For Peddling Her Product Line,"Kellyanne Conway got herself into a world of sh*t when she decided to violate ethics rules on behalf of Ivanka Trump s business. Because now Ivanka is PISSED.On Thursday, Conway whined about Nordstrom dropping Ivanka s product line due to lack of sales and then she desperately begged Fox News viewers to open their wallets. They are using the most prominent woman in Donald Trump s life,  Conway began.  Using her, who has been a champion for empowerment of women in the workplace, to get to him. I think she s gone from 800 stores to a thousand stores, or a thousand places where you can buy. You can buy her goods online. Go buy Ivanka s stuff is what I would tell you. I hate shopping, I m going to go get some myself today. This is just a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. And by promoting Ivanka s business, Conway violated Federal Code  2635.702, which specifically states:An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member .An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise.Ethics complaints have bombarded Trump s administration ever since and Ivanka s business is now embroiled in a political scandal, which won t help sales.Despite apologizing to Donald Trump and apparently being forgiven, Kellyanne Conway still had to face Ivanka and the confrontation was reportedly not pretty.According to Politico, A source close to Trump said that his daughter scolded Conway for dragging her brand into an ethics mess and told her not to mention it again on TV. This was a continuation of a conversation that Ivanka Trump had with her father weeks earlier about leaving her business out of the politics, that Conway wasn t aware of. So Ivanka took Kellyanne Conway to the woodshed for hurting her company. And that s just another example of the chaos and infighting that has been occurring inside the White House since Trump took office. One wonders how long it will be before Kellyanne Conway gets fired. Because the way she has repeatedly embarrassed herself on television in defense of Trump, that day should be soon, especially if she keeps angering Ivanka.Featured image via Yana Paskova/Getty Images",News,"February 12, 2017",0,2711

 Kellyanne Conway Admits Comey Tapes Probably Exist But Says Trump Doesn’t Have Them (VIDEO),"Does Donald Trump have tapes of his conversations with fired FBI director James Comey? Until Thursday, he said yes   but after it became apparent that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had hired a team that included former Watergate investigators, Trump changed his story.Now, he says, he was just trying to obstruct justice by using the idea that there were tapes to intimidate James Comey before he testified   a gambit that led to Comey laughing at him during a public hearing.At this point, Trump would be stupid to personally be in possession of any tapes of their conversations, but White House spokesidiot Kellyanne Conway hints that tapes may exist   Trump just doesn t keep them in his nightstand like they are a book of Adolf Hitler s speeches (yes, he kept a book of Hitler s speeches at his bedside).During an interview with CNN s Alisyn Camerota, Conway refused to say why it took 42 days for The Donald to change his story about the tapes with which he threatened the man whom he fired for requesting additional funding for the Russia investigation   but she used some very interesting wording while attempting to explain away Trump s self-made scandal. So the president made clear yesterday and in an interview aired early this morning, Alisyn, on Fox News, that he doesn t have tapes   didn t make tapes, but he left open the possibility they may exist,  Conway said, hinting that because of the  surveillance and leaking going on  the tapes might just surface. But why did we live this charade, there might be tapes or might not?  Camerota asked. There was no charade,  Conway replied. Answer definitively   there were no audiotapes?  Camerota pressed. He answered definitively yesterday,  Conway shot back. Why is he always on your timeline? Strangely, Conway nor Trump denied that tapes were made. Trump just said he personally didn t record them   which would have been a rookie move even for him   and Conway explained that Trump wasn t personally in possession of them.As Republican Rep.

" Trump Project Under Federal Investigation, Possibly Violates Labor Laws","Donald Trump s project that is supposedly converting the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C. is the subject of a Labor Department investigation. It is being alleged that workers on the site are being paid less than what is mandated under federal law.The Labor Department confirmed to POLITICO that it s looking into allegations of wage-rule violations by the Craftsmen Group, a Trump Organization subcontractor that restores windows. And workers on the site, including one Craftsmen Group employee, told POLITICO that they and others aren t receiving pay rates mandated by law. Two of them produced pay stubs to support their claims.Trump s refurbishment of the Romanesque pile, built in 1899, into a luxury hotel is his highest-profile real estate project, if only because the historic structure is situated just a few blocks from the White House. Trump staged a campaign event at the construction site in March, blending presidential politics with commerce.  When it s completed,  he said,  it will be truly one of the great hotels of the world. Trump s contract with the federal government for the site is actually structured so that Trump is actually leasing it from the government. That means wages on the site are set by federal law, which requires all workers   union or not   on the site to be paid the  prevailing wage  set in the area by labor unions.A sign at the Trump site pointed out that glaziers, the workers installing shower doors, should be paid between $24.30 to $27.64 an hour. But their paystubs show them earning way less   between $13 to $16 an hour   almost half of what the law requires.Trump has been slammed recently for repeatedly underpaying contractors who have done work on his properties, and in some instances not paying them at all for the work they ve done for him and his companies.

White House unveils measures to help inmates find work after prison,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday rolled out a series of education and work training initiatives focused on helping convicted criminals avoid returning to prison, part of President Barack Obama’s legacy-shaping effort to overhaul the U.S. criminal justice system as he prepares to leave office. The measures include a program that will link 67 colleges and universities with 141 correctional facilities to provide education and training to about 12,000 inmates. The program will offer federal Pell grants to prisoners, with an emphasis on inmates set to be released within five years of starting classes. “The bottom line is that our communities are less safe when the stigma of incarceration prevents Americans from truly ever shedding their prison jumpsuit,” White House senior adviser  Valerie Jarrett said on a call with reporters. “When people leave prisons and can’t turn their lives around, they too often end up back behind bars,” she said. Other programs unveiled on Friday will offer $31 million in grants for organizations to offer occupational training and apprenticeship opportunities for young adults and more than $5 million to organizations that help inmates prepare for employment. Obama’s top cabinet members for justice, education, labor and housing praised the reentry initiatives as common-sense reforms that should have been in place long ago. “All the little things that people take for granted generate tremendous obstacles for people who are coming out of the criminal justice system,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a panel hosted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank. Obtaining photo identification or being considered for job opportunities were two examples. “In order to compete, you have to be allowed in the arena,” she added. Hiring people with a criminal history “is not an act of charity, it is an act of enlightened self-interest,” Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said, commending Maryland’s largest private employer, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, for employing so many people with criminal backgrounds. Despite bipartisan support for reform of mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, legislation addressing the issue has stalled in Congress. Jarrett said the White House remains hopeful that criminal justice reform will be approved by lawmakers. “We would like to see those bills move forward as quickly as possible,” she said. “We are going to do everything we can to work with members on both sides of the aisle to make sure it comes to fruition.” ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1,2637
Canadian Sikh politician wins race to lead federal New Democrats,"(Reuters) - Jagmeet Singh, an Ontario provincial lawmaker and practicing Sikh, was elected on Sunday as leader of Canada s left-leaning New Democrats, becoming the first non-white politician to head a major Canadian political party. The 38-year-old lawyer, whose penchant for colorful turbans and tailor-made three-piece suits made him a social media star, was elected on the first ballot to lead the New Democratic Party into the 2019 federal election against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s Liberals.  Thank you, New Democrats. The run for Prime Minister begins now,  Singh tweeted. Singh secured 54 percent of the vote, defeating three rivals to become the new head of the NDP, succeeding Thomas Mulcair. The results of the vote, conducted online and by mail, were announced at a party meeting in Toronto. The Toronto-area politician, who led in fundraising since joining the race last May, had been touted by supporters as someone who could bring new life to the party, which has struggled since the death of charismatic former leader Jack Layton in 2011. Singh s profile was boosted in early September after a video went viral showing him calmly responding with words of love to a heckler who interrupted a campaign event to accuse him of wanting to impose Islamic Shariah law in Canada.  His skill, in being able to diffuse the situation, it understandably appealed to a lot of people who ended up supporting him,  said Christopher Cochrane, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. Cochrane added that Singh s ability to connect both with young people and ethnic minorities would make him a  force to reckon with  when competing against Trudeau in 2019. Trudeau congratulated his new political rival on Twitter on Sunday, saying:  I look forward to speaking soon and working together for Canadians.  The NDP is the third largest party in the federal Parliament, with 44 of 338 seats. The party lags well behind the centrist Liberals and right-leaning Conservatives in political fundraising this year, according to Elections Canada data. Singh will now focus on rallying supporters and targeting center-left voters who helped propel Trudeau s Liberals to a decisive victory in 2015. There are hurdles ahead. Singh does not have a seat in the federal parliament and will have to win one in a special election.

 Noam Chomsky GOES OFF On Donald Trump: ‘He’s A CLOWN!’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that world-renowned political theorist Noam Chomsky does NOT want Donald Trump in the White House, and thinks it s an absolute tragedy that the presumptive Republican nominee has even managed to get as far as he has.In an interview with Art Is Power, the author and MIT professor criticized The Donald for using  generalized anger  and his racist white supporters  fear of becoming a minority to his advantage, knowing full well that it was a strategy that would work in the polls. Chomsky also likened Trump s hateful rhetoric to Adolf Hitler as he explained Trump s formula for success: So every time Trump makes a nasty comment about whoever, his popularity goes up. Because it s based on hate, you know, hate and fear. And it s unfortunately kind of reminiscent of something unpleasant: Germany, not many years ago. Chomsky pointed out how interesting this year s presidential primaries had been   not in a good way   and used the business mogul as a prime example. He s a clown   literally, he could be in the circus. He s getting huge support from people who are angry at everything. Mostly white males. Working-class, middle-class, poor white males. And their wives and traditional families. They are furious about everything. In his analysis of Trump s campaign, Chomsky explained that all the disgraced candidate had done was tap into America s nativism. In the past, Americans had been worried about being  replaced  by Germans or Irish immigrants. All Trump did was change the words to make his racist supporters scared of Muslims and Mexican immigrants   and he did a great job fear mongering and relentlessly attacking those specific minorities to achieve his goals.You can watch Chomsky rip Trump below:Chomsky has expressed his disgust over the presidential candidate before, when he called the GOP  the most dangerous organization in human history , criticizing it for creating the kind of hostile, extremist political environment that would allow a joker like Trump to rise.Featured image via William B.

" After Democrats Filibuster For 15 Hours, Republicans Cave, Allowing A Vote On Gun Control","For 15 hours (now the 8th longest filibuster in Senate history), Senate Democrats stood their ground and demanded the Senate take up gun control measures in the wake of the terrorist attack in Orlando. For 15 hours, 37 senators   including two Republicans and two Independents   stood before the American people and relentlessly pleaded their case as to why urgent action was needed.Well, it worked. After pledging to hold the floor until something, anything, was done, Republicans caved.At roughly 2 AM (Washington time), Senator Chris Murphy, who launched the historic filibuster, announced that the Senate will take up closing the terror gap and universal background checks: It is our understanding   that we have been given a commitment on a path forward to get votes on the floor of the Senate   on a measure to assure that those on the terrorist watch list do not get guns and an amendment   to expand background checks to gun shows and to internet sales. Thanking the millions of people who tuned in, called and emailed their congressional representatives, and stood strong against gun violence, Murphy vowed to push on defiantly no matter what the Senate chooses to do when the votes come in.While Murphy and other Senate Democrats spoke on the floor, Republican John Cornyn, the Senate s no. 2, and Democrat Dianne Feinstein began crafting legislation to ban suspected terrorists on a watchlist from buying guns. However, Chuck Schumer, who is poised to become Majority Leader should the Democrats take back the Senate, warned fellow Democrats to be cautious of Cornyn s compromises, saying it was filled with  hoops and ladders. The Senators that spoke on the floor were:If your senator made the list, congratulations. If not (except Feinstein), shame. This historic filibuster will be one generations will look back on and ask why it had to happen. It took 15 hours of nonstop talking to get Mitch McConnell to agree to no-brainier legislation.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2016",0,2090
 WATCH: Trump Supporter Says Women Shouldn’t Be Allowed To Be Leaders,"If there is a special place in hell for a woman who works against the best interests of women, this Trump supporter already has a reservation.Young Turks reporter Jordan Chariton went to Donald Trump s rally in North Carolina on Wednesday before it began to interview several Trump supporters.When Chariton asked one woman if she had a birthday message for Hillary Clinton, rather than say something nice the woman said,  Trump that bitch! We could care less about her birthday,  the woman continued, going on to remark that she hopes Hillary won t be in the White House.The woman then proceeded to tell Chariton that she won t be happy about a Clinton being in the White House, even though it would mark the first time in American history that a woman has been elected President of the United States.  Absolutely not,  she said.And instead of citing her policies or anything else, this Trump supporter said she opposes Clinton because of her gender.  I don t believe there should be a woman President,  she said.And that means any woman. But why? I believe in Christianity and I see that she does not stand for the Christianity,  she went on to say. Does Christianity say you can not have a female President?  Chariton followed up. It doesn t say,  she replied.  I just don t believe there should be woman leaders. I believe women should stand back from things like this, especially the White House. In other words, this Trump supporter believes that a woman s place is being submissive to men just like conservative  Christians  believe. The woman Chariton interviewed doesn t even think women should be  speakers.  Translation: women should shut up and stay in the home and not have any say in political matters whatsoever.Later in the video, the same Trump supporter reversed herself by saying that Jesus might frown upon a woman being a leader and further stated her belief that Donald Trump feels the same way.She went to say that she thinks the 12 women who have accused Trump of sexually assaulting them were paid by the Clinton Foundation to do so. It s an accusation with ZERO evidence to support it. But there is lots of evidence suggesting that Donald Trump is a sexual predator.Here s the video via YouTube.To recap, Donald Trump thinks women are sex objects for men to conquer and do with as they please. His supporters don t give a damn about the victims he has harmed over the years. Trump supporters have also been calling for the 19th Amendment to be repealed, which would strip women of the right to vote. And now we have video of a Trump supporter saying that no woman should ever be allowed to be a leader or speaker.And yet Republicans wonder why women continue to leave the GOP.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 27, 2016",0,2796
 President Obama Furiously Blasts Trump And GOP For Blaming All Muslims For Terrorism,"President Obama is pissed off and he took Republicans and their nominee to the woodshed on Tuesday for inciting hate against all Muslims and insisting that describing terrorists using certain words will make the threat disappear.Ever since the mass shooting in Orlando, Republicans and Donald Trump have suggested that President Obama is weak on terrorism because he hasn t said the words,  radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently tired of hearing this line of bullshit, President Obama struck back with logic and reason during remarks at the Treasury Department. What exactly would using this language accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction,  Obama continued before making it clear to anyone who thinks the administration is  confused  should tell that to all the terrorists who have been killed or captured by our military. The men and women who put their lives at risk and the Special Forces I ordered to get bin Laden and are now on the ground in Iraq and in Syria   they know full well who the enemy is. So do the intelligence and law enforcement officers who spent countless hours disrupting plots. And protecting all Americans, including politicians who tweet, and appear on cable news shows. They know what the nature of the enemy is. So there s no magic to the phrase  radical Islam.  It s a political talking point. Clearly, Obama was taking aim squarely at Donald Trump without even saying his name by talking about  politicians who tweet. But President Obama had more strong words to say to Republicans and Trump on the subject of discriminating against all Muslim for the actions of one in Orlando. We are now seeing how dangerous this kind of mindset and this kind of thinking can be,  Obama said in reference to Trump s renewing his hateful call to ban all Muslims from entering the country.  We re starting to see where this kind of rhetoric and loose talk and sloppiness about who exactly we re fighting, where this can lead us. Are we going to start treating all Muslim-Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that s not the America we want. It doesn t reflect our Democratic ideals. It will make us less safe. Here s the video via YouTube:President Obama has rarely displayed flashes of impatience or anger in response to the Republican Party, but after Trump and the GOP have started to suggest that Obama is helping the terrorists, it appears President Obama is done taking shit from them at a time when he is busy trying to take out ISIS leaders even as Republicans continue to refuse to do their part by declaring war.Indeed, if Republicans believe terrorism is such a big threat, one would think they would take the step of declaring war so that President Obama can use all the tools at his disposal to destroy the terrorists and present a united White House and Congress to the American people on this serious issue.But Trump and Republicans would rather play partisan games instead of doing their jobs to protect the American people.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"June 14, 2016",0,3580
 80-Year-Old Man Guns Down 81-Year-Old Over Church Loan (VIDEO),"On June 13, 80-year-old Edward Acquisto shot and killed 81-year-old John Cloud in a Rhode Island cemetery.According to police, Acquisto had taken out a  substantial loan  from a congregational church in nearby Kingston, MA. The two men arranged to meet at Pocasset Hill Cemetery, in Tiverton, Rhode Island, where Acquisto reportedly went to read his Bible, to discuss the loan.Police did not provide details on the amount of the loan or how Acquisto spent the money that he borrowed from the church.During a press conference, Tiverton Police Chief Tom Blakey said,  There were people visiting graves in the cemetery, visiting loved ones  gravesites, and they heard the commotion, heard the gunshots. After shooting Cloud, the elderly Acquisto led police on a car chase, which ended when he turned down a dead-end street.Acquisto reportedly shot at police before law enforcement killed him in a Tiverton resident s driveway.WPRI reports that Acquisto was out on parole when he shot and killed Cloud.He was sentenced to life in prison in 1981, after raping his former girlfriend in her home. A year later he was sentenced to ten additional years in prison for beating a man to death. He was paroled in 2003.At this time it s unknown where or how Acquisto got the gun he used to shoot Cloud.There is no permit required for someone over the age of 18 to purchase a gun in Rhode Island. The state does require an  application,  and all sellers are supposed to conduct a background check through state or local law enforcement.In spite of that, a man who was released on parole after raping one person and killing another, somehow managed to obtain a gun.While it s possible that Acquisto didn t obtain the gun he used to kill Cloud legally, as the Law Center To Prevent Violence reports here, it s also more than possible that he did.Many states still do not require private gun sellers to conduct criminal background checks. Lax gun-control policies across the country allow violent felons to purchase guns with no questions asked.Here s more from WPRI. Image credit: Mele Avery via Flickr",News,"June 29, 2016",0,2148
TV Host Buys and Forgives $15m Worth of U.S. Medical Debt,"21st Century Wire says This latest stunt only goes to show what a complete rip-off the US healthcare industry truly is.This week, John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight trumped media mogul and billionaire Oprah Winfrey by announcing he will forgive the medical debt of 9,000 people. Presently, the US healthcare industry has the world s highest and most inflated medical pricing on goods and services   pushing millions of Americans into debt over health treatments which should not cost the same as a brand new Lexus SUV or Land Rover. Despite the hype, Obamacare did nothing to address this fundamental flaw in the US system. In fact, it made the situation worse, and has turned out to be absolute boon for the corporate insurance racket.If Obamacare was really all it was cracked up to be, then it would ve done en mass what John Oliver demonstrated on his show   buying up medical debt at a merger one half cent on the dollar, and then putting that into cold storage. Instead, Obamacare only succeeded in RAISING the cost (and debt) of healthcare for individual payers.More on this story here  Watch out, Oprah Winfrey. John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight, outdid TV s biggest gift giver on Sunday when he forgave nearly $15m worth of medical debt on his show.Oliver s  giveaway  came at the end of a 20-minute segment on debt collectors. The segment focused on the bad actors in the industry, who buy debt from banks for cents on the dollar. These predatory collectors attempt to recoup the debt they purchased using threats and other aggressive tactics without first verifying the exact details of the debt. Once the company has bought your debt, whether the information is accurate or not, they are going to try to collect on it,  Oliver explained on Sunday.Last Week Tonight spent about $50 to create a debt-acquisition company in Mississippi. The corporation s name is Central Asset Recovery Professionals Inc   also known as Carp. According to Oliver, soon after its creation, Carp was offered a portfolio of medical debt worth $14,922,261.76 at a cost of  less than half a cent on a dollar, which is less than $60,000 .( )  Thanks to this 5 June airing of the HBO comedy series, Last Week Tonight show with John Oliver, there are a lot more of us now privy to this collection industry practice and the debt treadmill it creates,  said Craig Antico, co-founder of RIP Medical Debt.  In a painfully hilarious (debt as funny? Somehow, yes) piece, John Oliver triumphantly out-Oprah s Oprah in giving away valuable gifts.

THE 2016 Calendar That Won’t Be Hanging In ISIS Caves Or Obama’s Oval Office,"Vladimir Putin the anti-Obama Fans of the maverick Russian president can now gaze upon him every day for the bargain price of just 78 Roubles (72p) by buying his bizarre and wonderful 2016 calendar.The momentous tribute to the iron-fisted leader features him in a typically outlandish range of poses, from fishing topless to cuddling a fluffy puppy.Each page portrays the legendary president s tough and sensitive sides, with him boasting about the prowess of the Russian military one month and professing his love of dogs the next.And it seems that Russians simply cannot get enough of their leader with the glossy calendar selling out in Moscow.But it is unlikely to adorn the walls of many Islamic State (ISIS) hideouts, with the hard man supremo s bombing blitz in Syria contributing to the terrorist group s accelerating collapse.Mr Putin seemingly alludes to the current military operations against ISIS, with some critics saying he has outflanked and out-thought Western leaders.The October entry features the stern Russian president wearing a military cap and striped shirt alongside a slogan proclaiming his country s military might.It states:  No one will succeed in gaining military superiority over Russia.

 Americans Demand Obama Pick Next Justice: GOP Gives Them A Huge Middle Finger (VIDEO)," Ever since the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Republicans have insisted on turning the constitutionally-backed nomination process into a political sideshow to deprive Obama of his legal right to name a new Justice and to deprive Americans of their say in the matter.Senate Republicans, led by their Obstructor-in-Chief Mitch McConnell, have repeatedly made the astounding claim that they will refuse to hold nomination hearings for any person Obama may choose. Sight unseen. Instead, they will spend the next 340 days with an empty seat on the Supreme Court   a glowing middle finger neon sign built in the way of the democratic process.For their part, the American people have made it absolutely clear that this sort of political point scoring is inappropriate, offensive, and unwanted. When Fox News (Fox News!) ran a poll asking if Americans supported Obama naming a new justice, an overwhelming majority said yes.Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s recent death has sparked a debate over how to fill the vacancy on the nation s highest court. Taking into consideration that it s an election year, which of the following is closer to your view?It s still the responsibility of current leaders, President Obama and the Senate, to take action to fill the vacancy now: 62The president shouldn t get to nominate someone for a lifetime appointment to the high court this late in his term: 34Note that the number transcends partisan lines. Obama s approval rating sits at around 50 percent. In other words, there are many people that may disagree with the president on issues, but recognize the fact that he is within his rights to name a new Supreme Court Justice.Republicans just don t care.Days after the polls began trickling in saying Americans wanted Obama to be able to fulfill his obligations, McConnell and other Republican leaders held a secret, closed door meeting in his office to decide what to do. Their conclusion was to circle the wagons, dig in and stick their heads in the sand. The Party of No is alive and well.Key Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee emerged from a closed door meeting in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s office Tuesday united in their determination not to consider any nominee to replace Anton Scalia until the next president takes office. We believe the American people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame duck president,  said Majority Whip John Cornryn.This is an egregious  screw you  to not only Democrats and the president, but also to the American people more broadly. It s disgusting that Sen. John Cornryn would invoke the  American people  in his disgusting defense of the GOP s actions, because the American people already had a voice when it came to the process   they voted for President Obama. Twice.If there is any good news in a story that is essentially about one political party destroying the fabric of the democracy to get their way, it s this: Republicans may fold their arms and throw a tantrum, but they are showing everyone   Democratic and Republican voters alike   that they only care about their own self-interest. The voice of the people? They couldn t care less. I wonder how that s going to play on election day.Featured image via Flickr",News,"February 23, 2016",0,3358
Merkel says not weakened in coalition talks by state-level defeat,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday dismissed the idea that her Christian Democrats  (CDU) defeat in a regional election had made her already tricky job of forming a three-way national coalition even harder. It was sufficiently hard enough anyway, she said. Still reeling from their worst national result since 1949 in September s national election, Merkel s conservatives slumped to 33.6 percent in the northern state of Lower Saxony, their poorest showing in the rich agricultural province in nearly six decades.  I don t see the Lower Saxony election result as weakening us in this (coalition) task,  Merkel said, adding that regional issues had played a big role in the campaign there. The Social Democrats (SPD) won the vote in Lower Saxony - home to carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), which is enmeshed in a diesel emissions scandal - with 36.9 percent, despite lagging far behind the conservatives when campaigning began in August. Education was one of the key campaign topics. Three weeks after her poor national showing, Merkel is about to begin what look set to be thorny coalition discussions with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens on forming a  Jamaica  alliance - so named because the parties  colors correspond with those of the Jamaican flag. Merkel said her conservative bloc was heading into the talks knowing it was the strongest of the three groups, while acknowledging negotiations would be challenging.  We ll have sufficient conflicts anyway. No one is under any illusions about that,  Merkel said. Policy areas over which the three parties are expected to clash include migration, climate and the euro zone. Greens co-leader Simone Peter said the talks would be tough due to the parties  vastly diverging programs, adding:  We must now pull ourselves together and see if coalition negotiations are possible or not.  The conservatives will meet the FDP and Greens separately on Wednesday and then hold three-way discussions on Friday. Merkel said she expected the exploratory talks - an initial stage during which parties decide whether to go ahead with full-blown coalition negotiations - to last several weeks because the  Jamaica  alliance,  untested at the national level, was  an extraordinary political constellation . Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the CDU s Bavarian sister party - said the time before Christmas needed to be used to form a stable government but his colleague Alexander Dobrindt was skeptical:  Whether it succeeds, whether a government is formed, is yet to be seen,  he said. Carsten Nickel, deputy research director at Teneo Intelligence, said the weak CDU result would particularly worry the CSU, which faces a regional election next year.  The CSU will fear that Lower Saxony demonstrates that the popular backlash against Merkel s choices in the 2015 migration crisis is not yet over,  he said, referring to her decision to operate an open-borders policy that allowed more than a million migrants to enter Germany. After the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) took almost a million voters from the conservative bloc in September s national election, the sister conservative parties put a long-running internal dispute to bed by agreeing to limit numbers of migrants coming to Germany.

" A Trump Fan Picks A Fight On A Plane, So The Captain Issues SCATHING Rebuke","As much as we activists might wish otherwise, it s not always a good idea to talk politics. This is particularly true if you re a insecure idiot Trumpkin who just has to say something stupid and racist to the passenger next to you on a plane. This actually happened on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where a Trump supporter scared the passenger next to him by gloating about the Cheeto King s win.According to the caption on the YouTube video, this Trump fan was wearing a plaid shirt and a camo cap, and he just had to say something about being happy that he could keep his guns to the black woman next to him. She began to cry likely because that sounds an awful lot like a threat, and the racism and racist threats that have been oozing out of Trumpkins since Nov. 8 is just vile.The two were separated, and then the pilot gave the entire plane a very stern talking to, thanks to said Trump fan: We re going to be in a metal tube at 35,000 feet to bring up politics. Okay? I understand everybody has their opinions, that s fine.Nobody wants to argue, nobody s going to change their minds by arguing, and let s keep our opinions to ourselves on this particular matter at this particular time.If there s anybody that has a problem with this, that needs to vent or rant or rave, there s another flight tomorrow. You re not going to be on this one. I hope that s clear. He got a lot of cheers for that.While some might interpret his full remarks as insensitive and even pro-Trump, he actually did what he needed to do to defuse the situation. Furthermore, he took down the gloating Trumpkin in the process, much to the pleasure of the other passengers.

"Only 'miracles' can move Brexit talks forward by October, EU tells Britain","TALLINN (Reuters) - Only  miracles  can move Brexit talks far enough to fulfill Britain s hopes of launching discussions next month on its future ties with the European Union, the head of the European Commission said on Friday. Prime Minister Theresa May had been hoping to use an informal EU meeting in the Estonian capital Tallinn to harness what she describes as renewed goodwill over Brexit to push the talks beyond the terms of the divorce, now just 18 months away.  Britain had aimed to make a breakthrough at a summit in Brussels on Oct. 19-20. Two years have been set aside for the Brexit talks and Britain risks crashing out of the 28-state bloc on March 29, 2019, without a deal on future trade terms. But Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU executive and long a bogeyman for some in Britain s eurosceptic press, said the first stage of talks on the rights of expatriates, the UK border with EU member Ireland and the financial settlement when Britain leaves had not gone far enough.  By the end of October, we will not have sufficient progress,  Juncker told reporters in Tallinn, a day after his chief negotiator ended the last round of Brexit talks.  At the end of this week, I am saying that there will be no sufficient progress from now until October unless miracles will happen.  His words were echoed by other leaders. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said both sides would need  a small miracle  to make the required progress before the summit. Irish leader Leo Varadkar said it was  still very evident that there s more work to be done . Their views will be a blow for May, who wants to move quickly on to discussion of the future trade relationship and a transitional arrangement - part of the deal Britain says is needed before any kind of financial settlement can be agreed. In Tallinn, May sidestepped questions over whether she was confident of the October deadline. After three months of talks, which have become bogged down in a spat over the divorce bill, the British prime minister tried to reset the tone with a speech a week ago in Florence. She had hoped to speak directly to EU leaders and reassure them that Britain was not picking unnecessary fights, going so far as to make concessions on the future role of the European Court of Justice and on the Brexit bill.  I made that speech to give momentum to the talks and I think we have seen that being shown in the talks that have taken place this week, and further progress has been made,  May said early on Friday. Pressing her case, she met German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the sidelines of the Tallinn summit and repeated her pledge for Britain to be  the strongest friend and partner to the EU  after Brexit, her spokeswoman said. Merkel said there had been progress, but that there was also a lot of work to do before October.  Altogether it was a very constructive talk,  Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit.  I think that the Florence speech helped to bring a new dynamic into the negotiation process.  May also held talks with Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo, who is concerned about the 800,000 Poles living in Britain. Both agreed on  the importance of reaching an early settlement on citizens  rights , May s spokeswoman said.  But a Spanish government official was blunt.  We don t negotiate with speeches, we negotiate with documents on the table,  he said, describing the two sides as  nowhere near  agreement on the Northern Ireland border and the divorce bill. On citizens  rights, considered by London one of the easier issues to settle, the official said Britain and the EU were getting close, but progress was  not sufficient yet . In a morning visit to Estonia s Tapa military base, where 800 British troops are deployed as part of NATO s efforts to defend against a newly assertive Russia, May said Britain was  unconditionally committed  to protecting Europe after Brexit. By focusing on defense, May wants to show that Britain has something to offer its European neighbors. She will say she is ready to share British expertise   including through the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)   to help EU nations build up their own cybersecurity capability. That, she hopes, could bolster her argument on the Brexit talks, and coax the EU into making concessions. ",worldnews,"September 29, 2017 ",1,4367
Liberians vote to bolster peaceful democracy in presidential poll,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberians voted on Tuesday in an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago. Outgoing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, is praised for maintaining peace since taking over after the end of the West African country s 14-year conflict in which child fighters were used. Liberia s policy of prioritizing reconciliation over justice, however, has meant that prominent figures responsible for the violence that killed a quarter of a million people are still present on the political landscape.   There is no clear frontrunner but Prince Johnson, a former rebel leader who finished third in the last election in 2011, is among 20 candidates on the ballot. The ex-wife of warlord-turned-president Charles Taylor, now imprisoned in the UK for war crimes committed in Sierra Leone, is the running mate of another favorite: former soccer star George Weah.  I am just voting for peace. We want peace right now,  said James Marthics, a voter in Paynesville, a suburb of the capital Monrovia. Residents queued before dawn at polling stations in Monrovia, some bringing small wooden chairs with them, and formed queues as vendors sold them soft drinks and palm wine.  Materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls. State broadcaster ELBC reported a party chair in Lofa County was detained for distributing money to voters. Elections commission head Jerome Korkoya said some individuals were arrested for trying to vote more than once, but he said voting went smoothly overall. Liberia is Africa s oldest modern republic. It was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943.  Johnson Sirleaf, Africa s first elected female president, won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post-war transition. She was re-elected in 2011 but is barred from seeking another term. Among the favorites to replace her is Vice President Joseph Nyuma Boakai.  Weah, who has won FIFA s world player of the year, was greeted at his polling station by supporters in football shirts. He came second to Johnson Sirleaf in 2005. Ex-rebel leader Johnson won around 12 percent of the vote in 2011. A widely-circulated video showed him sipping a beer as he directed the torture of President Samuel Doe shortly before his murder in 1990. Ballot counting started soon after polls officially closed at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT), though voting continued in some areas where there had been delays. Results are expected to begin arriving later this week. But most analysts think it will be difficult for any single candidate to win an outright majority on Tuesday, raising the likelihood of a run-off election next month. Few believe there is a real risk of a return to war but in a national address on Monday Johnson Sirleaf called for peace.  Though held in high esteem internationally, many Liberians, who call her simply  Ellen , say they are disappointed she has not achieved more in her 12 years in office. Liberia is currently 177th out of 188 countries ranked by the U.N. human development index, and Johnson Sirleaf has faced accusations of nepotism and failing to crack down on corruption.

Support for Irish PM's party falls as snap election nears,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Support for Ireland s governing Fine Gael party fell in a poll on Saturday as a political crisis that has left the country three days away from the calling of a snap election showed no sign of being resolved. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar s minority government was on the brink on Friday after the party propping it up submitted a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister, weeks before a summit on Britain s plans to leave the European Union where Ireland will play a key role. Varadkar has said that if the motion put down by Fianna Fail, the main opposition party, is not withdrawn by Tuesday, he would be forced to hold an election before Christmas. Support for his party dropped two points to 27 percent in the Sunday Business Post/Red C poll, only marginally ahead of the 25.5 percent it achieved at last year s election and its worst performance in recent opinion polls. Fellow center-right party Fianna Fail rose to 26 percent from 25 percent a month ago and leftwing opposition Sinn Fein were up two points to 16 percent, both also marginally higher than the last election. The survey was taken between November 20 and 24, the day the crisis escalated rapidly and suggested the parties would struggle to form anything but another minority administration.  Again (the poll) suggests no one wins at a Christmas election if these numbers hold,  Richard Colwell, the chief executive of Red C, wrote on Twitter. Varadkar has said that there is still time to avoid the snap poll but neither side were stepping down on Saturday ahead of the motion of no-confidence, to be debated on Tuesday.  Although the leaders will do their best, it is unlikely that the positions are going to shift between now and Tuesday, and if that is the case the only way we can prevent an election is for the Tanaiste to resign,  senior Fianna Fail MP Jim O Callaghan told national broadcaster RTE. The Tanaiste is the name given to the position of deputy head of government in Ireland, currently held by Frances Fitzgerald. Health Minister Simon Harris said the price of any talks over the next three days  will not be the head  of the deputy prime minister and that the agreement with Fianna Fail that allows the minority government to function was  extremely badly damaged.  Varadkar is due to play a major role in the Dec. 14-15 EU summit on Brexit, telling fellow leaders whether Dublin believes sufficient progress has been made on the future border between EU-member Ireland and Britain s province of Northern Ireland. The government has said enough progress has not been made to date. The border is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly resolved before it decides whether to move the talks on to a second phase about trade and EU officials have said a snap election in Ireland would complicate that task.

Uzbek dissident charged with anti-government propaganda: report,"ALMATY (Reuters) - An Uzbek dissident who was detained this week on return from exile has been charged with two public security crimes that each carry a possible five-year sentence, news website Gazeta.uz quoted police as saying on Thursday. Nurulloh Muhammad Raufkhon, the first prominent dissident to return to Uzbekistan since the death of its long-time leader Islam Karimov, was detained on arrival on Wednesday, raising questions about the new president s efforts to change the country s image. Doniyor Tashkhojayev, deputy chief of Tashkent police, told local media Raufkhon had been charged in absentia and put on a wanted list after a criminal investigation launched in May. The charges include making public calls for unconstitutional change of the state order and producing and disseminating materials containing threat to public security and public order. Each is punishable by up to five years in prison. The interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Raufkhon was in exile in Turkey after publishing in the spring of 2016 a book critical of Karimov who had run the former Soviet republic with an iron fist since 1989.     The authorities then raided Raufkhon s house and put him on a blacklist of potential extremists and dissidents, which forced him to stay abroad. Karimov died last September and his successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, last month ordered the removal of 16,000 people, including Raufkhon, from the blacklist, as part of a broader liberalisation campaign. But Raufkhon s detention and possible conviction could indicate that Uzbekistan s powerful security apparatus is putting limits on such reforms. According to privately-owned Gazeta.uz, deputy chief of police Tashkhojayev said police would investigate Raufkhon s case and also see if his alleged crimes could fall within the scope of an amnesty.

Germany hopes for improvement in Turkey ties after new prisoner release,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said Turkey s decision to release a sixth German citizen from jail on Thursday gave hope that relations between the two NATO allies could improve after plumbing new lows following a failed coup in 2016. The decision to allow pilgrim David Britsch to return to Germany follows the release earlier this week of German journalist Mesale Tolu after nearly eight months in prison.  Decisions such as these give hope that we can rebuild trust step by step and relax the bilateral relationship,  Gabriel said in a statement released late on Thursday. Gabriel said he had agreed with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu to continue talks given the  difficult issues  that still had to be resolved. Germany is home to some 3 million people of Turkish heritage.  Following recent rulings in Turkey, six persons have now been released from prisons or allowed to leave,  Gabriel said.  And in the case of the imprisoned journalist Deniz Yucel, the Turkish judiciary has at least made the conditions for detention easier. The next urgent step here is the presentation of an indictment.  The releases come two weeks after German federal prosecutors dropped an investigation against a dozen Muslim clerics who were suspected of spying in Germany on behalf of the Turkish government. Tolu was charged with being a member of a terrorist organization and publishing terrorist propaganda following the July 2016 coup. She was released on the condition that she does not leave the country.  German politicians have been outspoken critics of Turkey s security crackdown since the coup. Tens of thousands of Turks have been jailed, including around a dozen who hold German citizenship.  Ankara has criticized Berlin for not handing over asylum seekers it accuses of involvement in the failed coup. It says  U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen was the mastermind of the coup, but Gulen denies involvement. ",worldnews,"December 22, 2017 ",1,2014

“You’re Not Welcome!” Obama As Welcome At Roseberg Funerals As Westboro Baptist Church Members [Videos],"Roseberg residents and families of victims are speaking out against Obama and are repulsed by his obvious desire to use the deaths and injuries of their loved ones to promote his leftist agenda. Of course, he s going anyhow. It is of no consequence to him that basically the whole town wants him to stay away. Keep it classy Barry Maybe the Roseberg residents should make the same kind of human chain between Barack and the cameras that they do around the Westboro Baptist  Church  members at funerals Roseberg residents and even relatives of victims are telling Barack Obama to stay home and don t come here to dance on the graves of our loved ones.  You re not welcome! Tomorrow President Obama is scheduled to visit Rosenburg, Oregon, where 10 people were killed last week at Umpqua Community College by a deranged killer who happened to use a gun to carry out his crimes.We ve already reported on the repulsed reaction from the community as people who live there continue to reject Obama s visit. Now Stacy Boylan, the father of shooting victim Ana Boylan, is directly speaking out against Obama s visit and has no interest in putting up with his exploitation of the tragedy for political purposes. I do believe it was Rahm Emanuel who said  Never let a good tragedy go to waste,  and I really feel that his [Obama] visit here is to completely to support his gun control agenda. I can t understand why he wouldn t make a mention of the families and the victims. I mean, he did say that it was a tragic incident and I do thank him for lowering the flags but he made it all about gun control. He was very clear about that and we saw this in Sandy Hook and now we re seeing it again and I just question his motives,  Boylan said.  I ve spoken to my family and for myself and for my family, my daughter and son, on principle I find that we are in disagreement with his policies on gun control and therefore we will not be attending the visit. My position on this is that gun free zones are an issue, they re a target for crazy people because they know they re not going to be met with resistance. You know, my daughter said to me,  What if somebody would have had a gun?  Gun free and gun control takes that option off the table. Somebody doesn t have to use their gun in defense, but to take that option entirely, I don t think that s the right course,  he continued. Via: Townhall On Monday, David Jacques, publisher of the Roseburg Beacon, appeared on a Fox News segment with Bill O Reilly.He made it clear President Obama was not welcome in Roseburg and certainly not to crash the funerals of those killed in the Umpqua Community College mass shooting by using it for his own liberal agenda.https://youtu.be/F-fS9SBLTGkVia: Downtrend",politics,"Oct 7, 2015",0,2840

 John Oliver Exposes Shocking Reality Of Money In Politics (VIDEO),"Activist groups across the U.S. have been raising the alarm about the disastrous impact of money in politics for a long time.While the majority of Americans take issue with the massive amount of money that flows into the political system, most have no idea just how absurd the situation has really become.Leave it to John Oliver to shine a light on the problem.In this segment of Last Week Tonight the comedian/talk-show host goes behind the scenes of Congress to examine how fundraising activities have all but replaced activities related to policy-making and governing in Washington DC.One the most startling revelations from the segment is the fact that most Washington officials now spend at least two-thirds of their time in office raising money for reelection.Oliver reports that elected officials spend at least four hours out of every work day inside Washington call centers. This time is entirely devoted to calling wealthy donors to solicit funds.Toward the end of the segment Oliver sits down with New York Congressman Steve Israel who recently announced his retirement from office, saying: I don t think I can spend another day in another call room making another call begging for money As John Oliver points out in the segment, every elected official in Washington is expected to raise a certain amount of funds for their respective political party.The amount of money a member of Congress is expected to bring in varies according to their position in Washington. An ordinary member of Congress might be expected to raise $125,000, for example. On the other hand, a representative with a greater amount of power and influence, such as Nancy Pelosi, is expected to raise as much as $800,000 for the DNC.During the interview Rep. Israel described how the current system skews the political system toward the rich.Describing what goes on inside a congressional call center, the congressman said: You have a bunch of cubicles set up, and those cheap fabric dividers, and you sit at a little desk, and you have a phone, and you have an assistant next to you, and you have a call book, and the call book has sheets of every donor, uh, past donors and their records, and your assistant gets a supporter on the phone and gives the phone to you and you engage in polite conversation and then you get to the point and then you hang up and then you flip the page to the next donor and then you make another call After John Oliver points out that it sounds like he s describing a  shitty telemarketing operation,  Rep. Israel responds by saying that he views it as  a form of torture.  He then points out that the real victims in all of this are the American people.He notes that the average American citizen believes that  they don t have a voice in this system. Because of the absurd amount of money that federal legislatures are forced to raise, elected officials can t afford to waste time on people unable to donate at least $1,000 to their campaigns.What this means is that if you have large amounts of money to donate to your Senator or Congressman, that money buys you access to an elected official. If you don t have that kind of money to contribute, you re basically out of luck.Watch the segment below, via Last Week Tonight on YouTube:Image credit: video screen capture via Last Week Tonight on YouTube",News,"May 8, 2016",0,3381
Greece charges nine over links to banned Turkish group,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Nine Turkish citizens were charged in Greece with terrorism-related offences on Wednesday, accused of hoarding explosives and of links to an outlawed militant organization responsible for suicide bombings in Turkey. The arrest of eight men and a woman in early-morning raids at three locations in central Athens on Tuesday came days before an expected state visit by Tayyip Erdogan, the first by a Turkish president to Greece in 65 years. Greece says the two events are unrelated.  Police officials said they were being questioned for alleged links to the leftist DHKP/C, a far-left group blamed for a string of attacks and suicide bombings in Turkey since 1990.  Their lawyer said the individuals, who have not been named, were  struggling against a fascist regime  and had denied any wrongdoing.  They were charged with setting up and being members of a criminal organization, terrorist-related acts of supply and possession of explosive materials, illegal possession of firearms, smoke bombs and fire crackers, court sources said. The individuals, escorted handcuffed into a central Athens court wearing bullet proof vests, have not entered a formal plea.   They are refugees,  lawyer Alexandra Zorbala said.  Some have sought, others have received asylum ... they are fighters who are struggling against a fascist regime, against torture and thousands of arrests.  . One of the charges they face is resisting arrest. At least one of the defendants entered the courthouse with a black eye. One of the detainees had been wanted by Greek police in connection with an arms and explosives haul off the Greek island of Chios, close to the Turkish coast, in 2013.    Turkey s Erdogan is widely expected to visit Greece in December, although his visit has not been officially announced. ",worldnews,"November 29, 2017 ",1,1856
Senate sets Wednesday vote on Obama veto of Saudi September 11 bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday on whether to override President Barack Obama’s veto of a bill allowing relatives of victims in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. The vote, which Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell set as the chamber reconvened on Monday, would be the first action in an attempt by lawmakers to override Obama’s Sept. 23 veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. A successful override requires support from two-thirds of lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives, which are controlled by Republicans. Known as JASTA, the legislation passed the Senate and House in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. In vetoing the bill, Obama warned that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, members of the military or companies, even for actions of foreign organizations that had received U.S. aid, equipment or training. McConnell said Wednesday’s vote will follow two hours of debate divided between Republicans and Democrats. No time for the vote has been set.   ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1,1339

Trump wades in on flap over L.L. Bean boycott threats,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Thursday tweeted his support of Maine catalog retailer L.L. Bean after an activist group opposed to the U.S. president-elect called for a boycott of the company. The boycott call began online last week after reports that a member of the Bean family that owns the company, best known for its rubber-bottomed hunting boots, had donated money to Trump’s candidacy. “Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L. Bean for your great support and courage,” Trump said in a tweet early on Thursday. “People will support you even more now. Buy L.L. Bean.” The “Grab Your Wallet” website added L.L. Bean, based in Freeport, Maine, to a lengthy list of retailers it is urging Trump opponents to boycott because of their ties Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20. L.L. Bean scrambled to distance itself from Linda Bean’s donations, noting that she was one of more than 50 members of the founding family associated with the 105-year-old company, which described itself as politically neutral. “Our owners, employees, and customers hold views and embrace causes that are individual and diverse,” the company said in a statement late on Sunday. “We fully acknowledge and respect that some may disagree with the political views of a single member of our 10-person board of directors.” A spokeswoman for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Trump’s tweet drew responses from supporters and opponents on Thursday, some of whom vowed to boycott the company, others who said they planned to buy its merchandise. Trump has taken on several prominent U.S. companies, including United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Carrier air conditioning unit and General Motors Co (GM.N) for manufacturing products outside the United States. His track record of pouncing on high-profile executives has left the leaders of corporate America wary of waking up one morning to find themselves Trump’s latest target. Maine is politically divided. It has a split Congressional delegation and a two-term Republican governor, but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton carried the state in the Nov. 8 election. On Thursday, Governor Paul LePage, a vocal supporter of Trump, praised Linda Bean. “It is reprehensible how progressives have bullied her and her family’s company,” LePage said. “I encourage Mainers and customers around the globe to continue their strong support of L.L. Bean.” ",politicsNews,"January 12, 2017 ",1,2463
Police arrest Kosovo opposition leader for no-show at court,"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo police arrested three lawmakers on Friday, including the popular main opposition leader whom they handcuffed in the street, after the three failed to appear in court on charges of releasing tear gas in parliament in 2015 and 2016. Opposition lawmakers obstructed parliament for almost two years by letting off tear gas in the chamber in a protest against a border deal with Montenegro and an EU-brokered agreement with Serbia. Albin Kurti, leader of Kosovo s biggest opposition party Vetevendosje, was seized and handcuffed by police close to parliament building when he was on his way to attend a regular session. Police used paper spray to disperse several other lawmakers from Kurti s party who tried to hold onto him and prevent police from taking him away, Kosovo media showed. He was eventually moved into a police van. Kurti won more votes than any other political candidate and his party came first in June snap elections, but he did not enter the ruling coalition.  All three MPs were given one month detention, Dukagjin Gorani of Vetevendosje told Reuters later in the day. Dozens of other MPs have been indicted so far for releasing tear gas in the 120-seat parliament.  This is the continuation of a massive and wide-ranging persecution that has started against Vetevendosje,  the party president, Visar Ymeri, said. Last week a court in Pristina sentenced four people, including one member of parliament, to prison terms ranging from two to eight years for taking part in a grenade attack against the parliament building last year. They were all loyalists of Vetevendosje. Opposition parties oppose the border deal with Montenegro saying the country of 1.8 million is losing land by handing over some 8,000 hectares (19,700 acres). The opposition is also against a deal signed in 2013 between Pristina and Belgrade as part of an EU-sponsored dialogue that would give more rights to the local Serb minority. They say the deal will practically divide the poor Balkan country on ethnic lines. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombing drove Serb forces from the territory. ",worldnews,"November 24, 2017 ",1,2213
U.S. bill would ban American tourist travel to North Korea,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. congressmen introduced a bill on Thursday that would ban Americans from traveling to North Korea as tourists and require them to obtain special permission for other types of visits. Democrat Adam Schiff and Republican Joe Wilson said their proposed North Korea Travel Control Act followed the detention of at least 17 Americans in North Korea in the past decade. North Korea has a record of using detained Americans to extract high-profile visits from the United States, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations. “With increased tensions in North Korea, the danger that Americans will be detained for political reasons is greater than ever,” the congressmen said in a statement. Given North Korea’s “demonstrated willingness to use American visitors as bargaining chips to extract high level meetings or concessions, it is appropriate for the United States to take steps to control travel to a nation that poses a real and present danger to American interests,” they said. Four Americans are being held in North Korea as diplomatic tensions with Washington have heightened. Two of them, detained in the past month, are affiliated with a private university in the North Korean capital. A congressional source said the bill would ban tourist travel by Americans outright, while any other visits would require a special license from the Treasury Department, which is enforcing a wide range of sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.      North Korea this month asserted its sovereign right to “ruthlessly punish” U.S. citizens it has detained for crimes against the government. It said calling such arrests bargaining ploys was “pure ignorance.” North Korea said on May 7 it had detained Kim Hake Song, who worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology,  on suspicion of “hostile acts.” Another American, Kim Sang Dok, who was associated with the same school, was detained in late April on the same charge. The other two Americans are Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old student detained in January 2016 and sentenced to 15 years hard labor for attempting to steal a propaganda banner, and Kim Dong Chul, a 62-year-old Korean-American missionary. Kim was sentenced to 10 years hard labor for subversion last year. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2017 ",1,2364
Doubts linger after Florida's Scott pitches biggest budget,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After deep cuts in spending for Florida schools and other public programs following the Great Recession, outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott this month proposed an $87.4 billion budget he says boosts spending on some depleted services to record levels.  Despite Scott’s meaty 2018-2019 budget recommendation, which is about $2.4 billion above current spending, advocates for Florida public education, environment and affordable housing remained skeptical the new plan would go far enough. “It doesn’t move Florida (schools) out from the bottom when compared to other states,” said Mark Pudlow, spokesman for the Florida Education Association, the state’s teachers union.  Florida’s public school per-pupil spending sank from a peak of $7,126 in the 2007-2008 budget to a post-recession low of $6,217 for the 2011-2012 year.  In his latest proposal, Scott recommended increasing funding to $7,176 per student, a $50 rise above record-high per-student funding. Florida has more than 2.7 million students enrolled in its public K-12 schools. Pudlow said he welcomed the governor’s increases, but support for Florida education was still lagging far behind most of the United States. The nationwide per-student spending average was $11,392 in 2015, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available. Adjusted for inflation, Pudlow pointed out, Scott’s budget puts Florida’s per-student spending at about $1,200 less than it was at its peak. Scott proposed increasing public elementary and secondary school spending to about $14.71 billion from some $14.45 billion in the current fiscal year.  Andrea Messina, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association, said she was hopeful Scott’s proposal signaled a an attitude shift in the state capital toward public education financing, but the bill was far from final. The Florida House of Representatives and Senate will hear the governor’s budget recommendations at the next legislative session starting on Jan. 9. They then make their own budget proposals and negotiate until a single plan is agreed on.  That budget will go back to the governor, who has the authority to veto line items before signing off on the bill. Scott has also proposed $180 million in cuts to taxes and fees and asked for sharp increases in spending on departments, including corrections, which would see more than 500 added jobs under the plan.  The budget for environmental protection would surge to more than $1.7 billion from $1.48 billion in the current year, making it among the budget’s biggest gainers. Florida Everglades restoration would be among the environmental projects to receive an infusion of funds. “That’s one place where we’re happy, although the devil is in the details,” said Frank Jackalone, director of Sierra Club Florida. Jackalone said he was concerned the state would continue to cut environmental rules enforcement and to take from earmarked funds intended for the environment to spend on other government programs. State Representative Carlos Smith, a Democrat who represents a central Florida district seeing an influx of residents fleeing from hurricane-battered areas, including Puerto Rico, said he opposed Scott’s budget proposal on affordable housing. Under the plan, overall spending on affordable housing would rise, Smith said, but it would also include a raid of nearly $92 million on trust funds earmarked for affordable homes. “We don’t know what to do, people are sleeping in cars,” Smith said of storm evacuees, namely Puerto Ricans fleeing the bankrupt and hurricane-battered U.S. commonwealth.

"BATON ROUGE COP KILLER Had “Inspirational” YouTube Channel, Was Racist Member Of Farrakhan’s Nation Of ISLAM: “My Religion Is The Religion Of ‘Justice'” [VIDEO]","This cop killer was a hateful, racist sub-human. He not only hated white people and cops, he bragged about it. The scary thing is, much like ISIS, who has no trouble recruiting people with hate in their hearts, there are no shortage of people to carry out Obama s war on cops in America. These are terrorists and our very own  President  has inspired these people to act on their hate for Whites, for cops and for America. This, is Obama s real legacy The 29 year old ex-marine, Gavin Eugene Long, who ambushed and killed three unsuspecting Baton Rouge police officers on Sunday morning, hated those who did not share his skin-tone and harbored a particular hatred for the police. As revealed in the hours after the shootings, a Youtube account operated by Long under the handle I Am Cosmo where the alleged killer posted dozens of clips, provides insight into what motivated the young man to kill three police officers and wound three more on his 29th birthday.In the Youtube videos, Long rants against  crackers, and makes multiple references to the July 5th killing of Alton Sterling at the hands of police officers only five miles away from Sunday s attack. The videos also detail that Long is a member of the Nation of Islam, labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its black supremacist and racist views towards Jews, Asians, and whites which the group s leaders argue have  sucked the blood from and exploited the black community.As Daily Caller details, the 29-year-old was a native of Kansas City, Missouri and was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2010 after reaching the rank of E-5.

House conservative: Tax overhaul must happen by Thanksgiving,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers must deliver tax legislation to President Donald Trump’s desk before December or lose their chance to enact bold reforms capable of driving the U.S. economy, a leading Republican conservative said on Wednesday. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told conservative activists that the prospects for significant tax reform would diminish as lawmakers approach the start of the 2018 congressional election campaign in January.  He said lawmakers needed to introduce tax legislation in September, pass the measure through the House of Representatives and Senate and send it to Trump’s desk by the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. “If it doesn’t get there by Thanksgiving, guys, it isn’t going to happen,” Meadows said.  The White House has said it expects the House to vote on a tax bill in October and the Senate in November. Trump’s fellow Republicans control both chambers, Analysts say the schedule could be too optimistic, because Congress is due to spend much of September and possibly October on spending bills to keep the government open and a debt ceiling increase to avoid default on sovereign U.S. debt. Lawmakers could be more likely to approve tax legislation in early 2018, the analysts say. But Meadows rejected that possibility. “The minute we go past January, everybody starts saying: ‘We can’t do anything too bold,’” he said.  Republicans plan to move tax legislation forward through a procedure known as reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to pass a bill with a simple majority. Republicans control the chamber by a 52-48 margin and would otherwise need 60 votes. The failure of Senate Republicans to find a simple majority for healthcare legislation last week has led to calls for bipartisan tax reform.   White House budget director Mick Mulvaney shot down that idea earlier on Wednesday.  “A tax bill looks a lot weaker, a lot less likely to get us to 3 percent economic growth, if we’ve got eight, 10, 12, 14 Democrats on it,” he told Fox News. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell rejected a Democratic overture for broad bipartisanship on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he still hoped some Democrats would back Republican tax legislation. “There is a great deal of bipartisan consensus about what ails our tax code, and my hope is that our friends on the other side of the aisle will join with us in a serious way,” McConnell said on the Senate floor.

The president of the United States,  CNN host John Berman said as he concluded the segment, seemingly agreeing with Kingston.The tone from liberals on Trump s legitimacy differs greatly from the president s own attitude toward former President Obama.

(VIDEO) LAWYER FOR “Patriot” Gyrocopter Mailman Who Landed On White House Lawn Asks A Very Good Question," I m Doug Hughes, I m 61 years old and I m a mailman working out of Riverview, Florida. No sane person would do what I m doing. I had carefully planned it so that no one would get hurt, including me especially me. I thought about being 75 years old and watching the collapse of this country, and thinking that I had an idea that might have arrested the fall  and didn t do it. And I will tell you, completely honestly that I d rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall. The wife of a Florida man who was arrested after he landed a one-man gyrocopter on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol building to protest money in politics insists that her husband is a patriot.While she says that she was not aware that her husband was going to attempt the illegal flight to Washington, Alena Hughes nonetheless believes that her husband is a  patriot  who  loves his country. I think he s a patriot and I m proud of him,  Mrs. Hughes told the media.Still, the whole incident has been  stressful,  Alena said.Doug Hughes, 61, a post office employee from Tampa Bay, Florida, told Capitol police that his gyrocopter mission was to highlight  money in politics  and he intended to deliver a letter to each member of Congress to urge them to initiate campaign finance reform.Since his arrest, the 61-year-old also claimed that the 2012 suicide of his son, John Joseph, also motivated him to make his protest flight.Hughes hired an attorney in Washington, but Mrs. Hughes also hired Paul Carr, her own attorney, just in case.Mrs. Hughes  attorney had an interesting take on Mr. Hughes  actions.  Tell me what restrictions mailmen have to deliver mail,  Carr said. The attorney went on saying,  He has a right to deliver mail. In fact, it s his obligation. Purportedly getting money out of politics has been a long-time goal of the left-wing. But Hughes is fighting against several Supreme Court decisions that holds that donating to politicians and political causes equates to a protected right of free speech.

Congo Republic signs peace accord with 'Ninja' rebels,"BRAZZAVILLE (Reuters) - The government of Congo Republic on Saturday agreed a ceasefire with rebels in the southeast region of Pool, halting a 15-year conflict that rights groups say has cost dozens of lives and forced tens of thousands to flee. Political violence spiked in the Central African oil producer after a contested presidential election in April 2016 was won by President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who has ruled for 33 of the last 38 years. A militia led by Frederic Bintsamou, better known as Pastor Ntumi, which fought Sassou Nguesso during and after a 1997 civil war, has been blamed by the government for deadly raids on police, military and government bases, and has also halted trade through the Pool region with blockades. In return, the government has bombed the Pool region, including one helicopter raid last year on a residential area that Amnesty International said killed at least 30 people. The unrest has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes and sparked allegations from human rights groups of abuse by government troops. Ntumi s so-called Ninja rebels have clashed with the Congo government since 2002 and have long sought an end to government military intervention in the Pool region. The peace agreement between the two sides was signed by Interior Ministry security advisor Fran ois Nd  and Pastor Ntumi s representative, Jean Gustave Ntondo.   Today is a great day for the Congolese. This is the day we have just signed the cessation of hostilities agreement,  said Ntondo.  Under the deal, the militias have agreed to hand over arms and allow the free movement of trade between the capital Brazzaville and the commercial hub of Pointe Noire. During hostilities, trains and cars were often halted by militias.  The government will oversee a commission that will monitor the peace, and loosen security in the region to allow people to travel to and from their family homes.

Trump says union head who accused him of lying has 'done a terrible job',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump clashed on Wednesday with a union official who accused the president-elect of lying about the number of jobs saved in a deal to keep air conditioner maker Carrier from moving some jobs from Indiana to Mexico. Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents workers at United Technologies Corp’s Carrier plant in Indianapolis, in an interview on CNN criticized Trump for at least the second time in two days over the deal.  Trump, in a Twitter post on Wednesday, offered a sharp reply: “Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers Local 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!”  On Tuesday, Jones told The Washington Post that when Trump spoke at the Carrier factory last week, “He got up there and, for whatever reason, lied his ass off.” Indiana state officials have agreed to give Carrier $7 million in tax breaks to encourage it to keep about 1,100 jobs in the state, although about 300 of the jobs are in the company’s headquarters and were not scheduled to go to Mexico. Only 800 of the positions are union factory jobs, and Carrier still plans to send an estimated 1,300 jobs to Mexico. Some employees are disappointed, Jones said on CNN on Wednesday. “We had a lot of our members, when the word was coming out of 1,100, they thought that they would have a job,” he said. In more remarks on CNN later on Wednesday, Jones responded to Trump’s Twitter post. “That’s pretty low-down, low life,” he said. “He doesn’t like to be challenged, and I challenged him.” Trump, who made tough talk on trade a centerpiece of his election campaign, had vowed to impose hefty tariffs if Carrier did not reverse course on shifting jobs to Mexico.  Trump posted another tweet after Jones’ later remarks on CNN. “If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana,” Trump wrote.

Democrats urge EPA not to reopen vehicle fuel efficiency rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and 11 other Democrats said on Tuesday it was “critical” that the Trump administration leave in place new vehicle fuel efficiency rules, saying the higher standards were achievable.  Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to announce as early as this week the reopening of a review of the rules that were set by the Obama administration for the 2022-2025 period. Automakers say the changes, which would raise the fleet average fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 from 27.5 mpg in 2010, will impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. They argue they need more flexibility to meet the rules amid low gas prices. Environmentalists, who favor the new standards, say they would reduce fuel costs and greenhouse gases and have vowed to sue if the Trump administration weakens them. “These automobile emissions standards are economically feasible and technologically achievable for the auto industry,” the Democratic senators, including Edward Markey of Massachusetts and former presidential candidate Bernard Sanders of Vermont, wrote in a letter to Pruitt. “It is critical that they remain in place.” EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn declined to comment on the letter “since the agency has not announced how it will proceed on the vehicle emission standards.” The White House also declined to comment. Trade groups representing automakers, including General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), have asked the EPA to withdraw the rules, which stem from a 2011 deal the industry reached with the U.S. government. The chief executives of GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), along with the top North American executives at Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and others separately have urged President Donald Trump to revisit the decision. The Obama administration in 2011 said the changes would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles and cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. In July, the EPA estimated the fleet would average 50.8-52.6 mpg in 2025 because Americans were buying more SUVs and trucks. It had until April 2018 to decide whether the standards were feasible under a “midterm review,” but moved up its decision to a week before President Barack Obama left office. The EPA is also considering taking steps to reverse California’s waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it to set its own vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards. California has repeatedly vowed to vigorously contest any efforts to withdraw its authority, and in January the state hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to represent it. At the Geneva auto show, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne told reporters he opposed the Obama administration’s decision to finalize the rules. “We have simply asked that the case be reopened to understand what the consequences would be of the norms introduced five years ago,” Marchionne said, adding that he expects to “see a positive reply in the coming days” from the Trump administration.

Kushner stresses Trump's Mideast peace optimism but details scant,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump remains committed and optimistic about achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace, his son-in-law and senior adviser told the sides on Thursday during his first visit to the region since last month’s surge of violence.  But there was little to suggest any breakthrough or significant progress toward ending a decades-old conflict is imminent as Kushner met separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Palestinians were still seeking a pledge of support from the Trump administration for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - the foundation of U.S. Middle East policy for the past two decades. The last round of peace talks between the two sides collapsed in 2014. For his part, Netanyahu faces pressure from right-wing coalition partners not to give ground on Jewish settlement building in occupied territory that Palestinians seek for a independent state. The settlement issue contributed to the breakdown of negotiations three years ago. “We have things to talk about - how to advance peace, stability and security in our region, prosperity too. And I think that all of them are within our reach,” Netanyahu, welcoming Kushner to his Tel Aviv office, said in a video clip released by the U.S. Embassy. Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation,  arrived in Israel with U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt on Wednesday after meeting Arab leaders in the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan.     “The president is very committed to achieving a solution here that will be able to bring prosperity and peace to all people in this area,” Kushner, who was tasked by Trump to help broker a peace deal, said in his response to Netanyahu. Meeting Abbas later in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Kushner said Trump sought “peaceful relations between the countries in the whole region” and was “very optimistic and hopeful for a better future for all Palestinian people and Israeli people”, according to a statement from Abbas’s office.   Trump has described peace between Israelis and Palestinians as “the ultimate deal” - and added a new wrinkle last February by saying he was not fixed on two states co-existing side by side as a solution to their dispute. Kushner last traveled to Israel and the Palestnian territories in June. A month later, he was involved in telephone diplomacy to stem Palestinian and Jordanian unrest over Israel’s handling of a contested Jerusalem holy site. Four Palestinians, three Israelis and two Jordanians were killed during the crisis.  Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said Kushner’s visit could prove significant, particularly because of the envoy’s consultations with regional allies this week: “This may create a new chance to reach a settlement based on the two-state solution and the Arab initiative and stop the current deterioration of the peace process.” Abu Rdainah was referring to a 2002 Arab League initiative that offers Israel diplomatic recognition from Arab countries in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and a full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in a 1967 war. Netanyahu has expressed tentative support for parts of the blueprint, but there are many caveats on the Israeli side, including how to resolve the complex Palestinian refugee issue. The statement from Abbas’s office quoted the Palestinian president as telling Kushner: “We know things are difficult and complicated but nothing is impossible when efforts are sincere.” ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2017 ",1,3648
 Donald Trump Just Gutted The Agency That Maintains Our Nuclear Arsenal,"The nation s nuclear arsenal is going to be even more difficult to maintain because Donald Trump just ordered the top people at the National Nuclear Security Administration to resign immediately.Donald Trump has previously claimed that he wants to ignite a nuclear arms race and expand America s nuclear arsenal, but it looks like he s only interested in making America less safe.The National Nuclear Security Administration is charged with keeping America s nuclear weapons up to date and ready to go so that if we ever need to use them they ll be in working order.The NNSA presents a budget to Congress every year and asks for money to do their jobs. But if Trump has his way, the NNSA will not be able to do these things.In the past, presidential appointees to posts like the NNSA have traditionally been held until after the new president appoints and the Senate confirms their replacement. Such a tradition ensures that the government is still working even during a transition of power.But according to Gizmodo,Trump, however, appears determined to immediately push out everyone who was appointed by Obama, regardless of whether or not he has anyone in line for the job. Or, as our source put it:  It s a shocking disregard for process and continuity of government. Just as with Obama s soon-to-be-removed international envoys, Trump has ordered Under Secretary for Nuclear Security Frank Klotz and his deputy, Madelyn Creedon both Obama appointees to leave their posts, even if it means no one is in charge of maintaining the country s nuclear weapons. According to our Energy Department source, Trump s team has yet to nominate anyone to succeed them. Since both positions require Senate confirmation, if could be months before their chairs are filled. And the vacancies may extend beyond the leadership roles.And because Klotz and Creedon are the only ones in the NNSA who can present a budget to Congress, it means the agency could end up without leadership and funding to do what it is supposed to do until Trump and the Senate do their jobs, and that could take months.An Energy Department source told Gizmodo that,  I m more and more coming around to the idea that we re so very very fucked. Donald Trump is putting our nation at risk by not observing the transition traditions that keep the government working efficiently and smoothly. He is apparently obsessed with ousting anyone who disagrees with him and anyone who was hired during the Obama Administration. But Republicans should remember that if they allow Trump to do this, they have no right to whine when Democrats do the exact same thing to conservatives in four years. Because then we ll see what taking out the trash really looks like.The fact that Trump is literally willing to weaken the effectiveness of our government and endanger our national security with his pettiness is frightening. The only person who is probably happy about this news is Vladimir Putin. Once again, Trump is a useful idiot to Russia.Featured Image: Pixabay",News,"January 9, 2017",0,3081
Washington State Judge Issues Temporarily Block on Trump’s Immigration Ban Nationwide,"21st Century Wire says On Friday a US federal judge in Seattle ordered a temporary nationwide block on U.S. President Donald Trump s 7 nation immigration ban. As expected, the White House labeled the legal ruling outrageous  and promised the White House intends to file an emergency stay .Judge James Robart, appointed by former President George W. Bush in 2003, ruled on the President s executive order on immigration and US Customs and Border Protection has already alerted major airlines that the United States will start reinstating previously banned visas.The war of words between the Administration and the members of the judiciary has been stark.  The answer is none,  Judge Robart said.  You re here arguing we have to protect from these individuals from these countries, and there s no support for that.  The new lawsuit seeks to permanently block parts of Trump s recent executive order which suspend entry to US from 7  Muslim-majority  countries which include Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.The complaint states that,  The executive order effectively mandates that the states engage in discrimination based on national origin and/or religion, thereby rescinding the states  historic protection of civil rights and religious freedom,  , calling it a violation of the U.S. Constitution.The US Department of Justice is expected to file the emergency stay on Saturday in defiance of Friday s ruling.Washington state s Attorney General, Bob Ferguson, issued a stark challenge to President Trump, saying, This decision shuts down the executive order right now. No one is above the law   not even the President . It s our president s duty to honor this ruling and I ll make sure he does,  added Ferguson.It is estimated that some 60,000 people from the affected countries had their visas cancelled.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump Files",US_News,"February 4, 2017",0,1962

 NUTJOB Missouri State Rep Beheads Live Chicken On Facebook Video To Make Point About Abortion,"A Missouri state representative is making national headlines today after he shared a video on Facebook of him decapitating a living chicken to drive home his disgusting opinion about abortion.In the grotesque video, GOP state Rep. Mike Moon promotes his anti-abortion bill while he hangs a live chicken upside down from a tree branch.Mr. Moon then says, When the governor called for the second special session this year, I was right in the middle of my summer job. But like any good career politician, when I get the call, I m going back to work,  he happily exclaims as he starts to slice into the neck of the chicken, causing it to writhe around and flap its wings.He then proceeds to mutilate the chicken, pulling out its heart while lecturing about the need to protect human lives. God gave us man dominion over life. He allows us to raise animals properly and care for them and then process them for food so we can sustain life. And that s what I m doing here with this chicken. So we ve been called back to this special session for the primary purpose of supporting life, protecting the unborn specifically. I think we need to get to the heart of the matter here. So today, I m filing a bill that will lead to the stopping of abortion in the state of Missouri and I hope you ll support it. The Springfield News reports that Moon s bill emphasizes that Missouri protect the right to life of all humans, born and unborn   and to require due process of law before the life of any human, born or unborn, is ended prior to natural death. The National Abortion Rights Leauge didn t think the stunt was very funny and calls Moon out for playing  political games  with the healthcare of women. It was insulting watching Rep. Moon use the rights of women across Missouri as some kind of political prop,  the organization said.  His call to ban abortion is disturbing and dangerous, no matter what he does with that chicken. Hopefully, the backlash from this stunt will make Mr. Moon realize that women deserve access to healthcare, regardless of what he likes to do to chicken in the privacy of his own home.Feature image via Screen Capture",News,"June 14, 2017",0,2231
Mexico's Carstens says 'implicitly' weighing risk of Trump victory,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico central bank governor Agustin Carstens said on Friday he is “implicitly” factoring in the possibility of Republican hopeful Donald Trump becoming U.S. president in the bank’s economic risk models. In an interview with El Financiero/Bloomberg Carstens was asked whether the chances of Trump, a persistent critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement, becoming the next president of the United States was in the central bank’s risk models. “Well, explicitly, no,” Carstens said. “But implicitly all of us have it in our heads, this possibility.” Carstens was also asked about Mexican monetary policy in the coming months after the bank launched a surprise rate hike on Feb. 17 to shore up the peso currency, which had been falling sharply against the dollar since the end of 2014. He reiterated that the February move was not the start of a monetary policy tightening cycle, but that the bank would be following moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve closely. “Our monetary policy will above all be led by ... the exchange rate, the monetary policy relative to the United States and the inflationary pressures that could occur due to the economic cycle in Mexico,” the central bank governor said. Trump, front-runner to win the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election, sparked outrage in Mexico with campaign vows to slap tariffs on Mexican exports and to build a southern border wall and make Mexico pay for it. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said this month his country would not pay for Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and likened his “strident tone” to the ascent of dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

Spanish police to take over Catalan polling stations to thwart independence vote,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s government said on Tuesday police would take control of voting booths in Catalonia to help thwart the region s planned independence referendum that Madrid has declared illegal. The dispute has plunged Spain into one of its biggest political crises since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s after decades of military dictatorship. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the referendum is against the law and the constitutional court has ordered it be halted while its legality is determined. Catalonia s separatist government, however, remains committed to holding it on Sunday. Rajoy, speaking on Tuesday alongside U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, said it would be  ridiculous  if the affluent northeastern region declared independence from Spain.  Trump said he opposed the referendum and wanted a united Spain.  I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain. I think it would be foolish not to,  he told reporters.  Senior Spanish government officials said on Tuesday authorities had done enough to prevent a meaningful referendum as Catalonia lacked an election commission, ballot boxes, ballot papers, a transparent census and election material.  Today we can affirm that there will be no effective referendum in Catalonia. All the referendum s logistics have been dismantled,  the Spanish government s representative in Catalonia, Enric Millo, told reporters in Barcelona. Catalonia s prosecutor has ordered the regional police - known as the Mossos d Esquadra - to take control of any voting booths by Saturday, a spokesman for the Madrid government s Catalan delegation said. In an order to police issued on Monday, the prosecutor s office said they would take the names of anyone participating in the vote and confiscate relevant documents.  Anyone in possession of the keys or entrance codes to a polling booth could be considered a collaborator to crimes of disobedience, malfeasance and misappropriation of funds, the order said. The Madrid government has in recent weeks taken political and legal measures to prevent the referendum by exerting more control over the use of public funds in Catalonia and arresting regional officials. Hundreds of police reinforcements have been brought into Barcelona and other cities. Madrid has also threatened fines against bureaucrats working on the ballot, including the region s election commission, which was dissolved last week. These actions have provoked mass demonstrations and drawn accusations from Catalan leaders that the Madrid government was resorting to the repression of the Franco dictatorship. A  yes  vote is likely, given that most of the 40 percent of Catalans who polls show support independence are expected to cast ballots while most of those against it are not.  But the unrelenting opposition from Madrid means such a result would go all but unrecognised, potentially setting up a new phase of the dispute.  The Catalan regional government, which plans to declare independence within 48 hours of a  yes  victory, maintained on Tuesday the vote will go ahead and it sent out notifications to Catalans to man polling booths across the region. Many had not yet received information about where or when they would be working after the state-run postal service was ordered to stop all mail related to the vote, a parliamentary spokeswoman for one separatist party said.

"How Trump rallies the faithful: Belittle Clinton, news media","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign rallies have turned into eruptions of barely contained emotions from his impassioned followers, who urge him to fight on despite a series of gut punches that have put his chances of winning in doubt. With the Nov. 8 election now only weeks away and polls turning against him, Trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. What he would do if elected is covered, but much of his speeches are spent belittling his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He also accuses the U.S. news media of a plot to bring him down, and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame. Opinion polls show a gloomy picture for Trump. A week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women, the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll on Friday showed Clinton up, with 44 percent to Trump’s 37 percent. And the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero. One woman at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday wore a homemade T-shirt that said “Trump Can Grab My,” with an arrow pointing to her crotch. On Friday in Greensboro, North Carolina, a man wearing a “Gays for Trump” shirt punched a protester who held up an upside down American flag. Both were ejected. Trump’s message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about Clinton, who Trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state. “She would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office,” he said. A crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up Clinton at an event in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. “Lock her up!” they chanted, mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events. Trump could only smile and shake his head.  “So young and so jaded already,” he said. The New York businessman feeds off the energy generated by crowds that pack his rallies by the thousands. But he is easily distracted, lurching from topic to topic based on whatever happens to sprint to mind. On Wednesday in Lakeland, Florida, Trump jumped from bashing the news media as “the most dishonest people you’ll ever see,” to tout his performance at a debate in St. Louis on Sunday - “which I won big league” - to Clinton’s stroll across the stage in front of him at that event. “And the papers said I invaded her space,” he said. “Believe me, the last space I want to invade is hers.” There are moments of levity. A woman who recovered from a brief fainting spell in the heat of Lakeland was pointed out by Trump. “That woman was out cold and now she is recovered — a little ding to the head,” he said, approvingly. Trump can form an attack line against Clinton out of pretty much anything that springs to mind. Venting about Chinese trade practices before a raucous crowd of perhaps 20,000 in Cincinnati on Thursday night, Trump  suddenly imagined how China might treat Clinton given her bout of pneumonia a month ago, which had caused her to nearly collapse at an event in New York. “If she goes down in Tiananmen Square, they’ll just leave her,” he said. “They’re tough people.” Trump’s crowds sometimes get agitated. Many of his supporters are upset at the news media, whipped into a frenzy by both Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who in Cincinnati introduced Trump by condemning “the insanity of the media, the insanity of the way they cover him.” Upon entering the arena, Trump’s traveling press corps was booed by thousands of people who chanted “tell the truth.” Trump boosters near the media work area repeatedly cursed and taunted reporters. “When are you all going to be ashamed of yourselves?” one man shouted. “Lower than Congress — that’s what your approval rating is.” ",politicsNews,"October 15, 2016 ",1,3933
NOT KIDDING! HILLARY’S State Department Blocked Investigation Into Muslim Terrorist’s Florida Mosque Because “It Unfairly Targeted Muslims”,"Nothing to see here. Hillary was likely just fulfilling a promise to a foreign Muslim donor. It wasn t the first time she gave a  stand down  order and if the Democrat party can help it, it won t be the last Hillary Clinton s State Dept. shut down an investigation into the mosque Orlando killer Omar Mir Siddique Mateen attended because it  unfairly singled out Muslims. The Fort Pierce Islamic Center, where Mateen worshipped several times a week, was under investigation by both the FBI and DHS as early as 2011 for ties to a worldwide Islamic movement known as Tablighi Jamaal which was linked to several terrorist organizations.But the investigation was shut down under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHS s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims, according to recently retired DHS agent Philip Haney. The FBI had opened cases twice on him, and yet they found no evidence to charge him; it means they didn t go through the same basic, analytical process that I went through over a three- or four-hour period in which I was able to link the mosque to my previous cases,  he told WND on Sunday.In other words, the FBI had limited options at stopping Mateen because it was ordered to back off its investigation into his mosque.Both Clinton and the Obama administration have a history of enabling Islamic terrorism.In 2012, Clinton s State Dept. was backing al-Qaeda in Iraq, which morphed into ISIS, and other Islamic extremist groups as a proxy army to topple Syrian President Bashir al-Assad. The Salafist [sic], the Muslim Brotherhood and AQI [al-Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria,  a leaked memo between her State Dept. and the Pentagon stated.  The West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support [this] opposition, while Russia, China and Iran  support the [Assad] regime. The FBI had opened cases twice on him, and yet they found no evidence to charge him; it means they didn t go through the same basic, analytical process that I went through over a three- or four-hour period in which I was able to link the mosque to my previous cases,  he told WND on Sunday. This secret document confirms that Clinton s State Dept.   and the Obama administration in general   were directly responsible for the rise of ISIS, which is now targeting the West. The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, confirmed the document s importance.  I don t know that [the Obama administration] turned a blind eye [to ISIS], I think it was a decision; I think it was a willful decision,  he said.Clinton even admitted some responsibility. The United States had   to be fair   we had helped create the problem we re now fighting,  she said in an interview with Fox anchor Greta Van Susteren.  When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, we had this brilliant idea we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force on Mujahideen, equip them with Stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.

 Watch Elizabeth Warren Get PISSED And Destroy A GOP Stooge Who Won’t Answer Her Question (VIDEO),"Elizabeth Warren is a strong advocate for justice on behalf of regular Americans, particularly when it comes to financial issues. She often speaks passionately about ideas she feels very strongly about, but she rarely gets visibly pissed off. However, one particular Republican stooge managed to accomplish that feat, as you will see in the video below.Senator Warren was speaking during a hearing that was intended to discuss covering the  costs  to banks if they were regulated, in an effort to prevent them from completely imploding the American economy again. Republicans produced a  star witness, Leonard Chanin, who is one of the people most responsible for the 2008 financial crisis, to testify that banks should not have regulations places on them. As you may have already figured out, that was a bad idea. Senator Warren pointed out how his personal inaction, as well as that of the rest of the Federal Reserve, basically guaranteed a financial crisis.Mr. Chanin, as Sen. Brown mentioned from 2005 to 2011 you held top positions in the Federal Reserve s division of consumer and community affairs, and in those positions you had both the legal authority and the legal responsibility to regulate deceptive mortgages, including dangerous subprime lending that sparked the 2008 financial crisis. But you didn t do it, despite years of calls and even begging from consumer advocates and others asking you to act. Instead, you did essentially nothing.According to the Dallas Fed, that crisis cost the American economy an estimated $14 trillion. It cost millions of families their homes, their jobs, their savings. It devastated communities across America.Republicans simply do not give a sh*t about how much it costs regular Americans to allow banks to literally rob the entire middle class of everything they own. This was a point that was slammed directly in the face of Chanin.So when you talk now about how certain regulations are too costly or too difficult to comply with, you sound a lot like you did before the 2008 crisis when you failed to act. So my question is, given your track record at the Fed, why should anyone take you seriously now.As if the severe embarrassment that she just laid on him personally was not enough, Chanin went on to try to lie to Senator Warren s face, followed by refusing to answer even the most basic questions from her afterwards. That s when it all went wrong for the Republicans  star witness. If the guy keeps his job after this embarrassment it ll be shocking.Watch what happens when you lie to Elizabeth Warren below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 6, 2016",0,2703
TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BECOME FIRST APPOINTED CITY COMMISSIONERS: Hope To Create More Opportunities For Illegals,"Is there really any point to go through the work and expense to become an American citizen anymore?Huntington Park may become the first city in California to appoint two undocumented immigrants as commissioners on city advisory boards, a lawmaker confirms.City Councilman Jhonny Pineda has picked Francisco Medina to join the health and education commission and Julian Zatarain for the parks and recreation commission.The 32-year-old lawmaker told CBSLA online producer Deborah Meron that he promised voters while running for office that he would create more opportunities for undocumented residents. Huntington Park is a city of opportunity and a city of hope for all individuals regardless of socioeconomic status, race, creed, or in this case, citizenship,  the councilman said in a statement.  Both these gentlemen have accomplished a great deal for the city. For that, on behalf of the city council, mayor, and our city, I want to say thank you to them both and I am confident they will do an excellent job on their commission posts. Pineda says he cleared the appointments with the city attorney, who confirmed there s nothing that requires a commissioner to be a registered voter, a documented citizen or even a resident, which technically means someone here without legal residency can serve.Appointees first pass a LifeScan background check.Medina and Zatarain would not be paid for the volunteer positions and would not have a direct hand in constructing policy but would help advise the council on legislation. Other commissioners receive a $75 monthly stipend on months when they hold meetings.Coming the same year that California allowed residents to apply for a driver s license, regardless of immigration status, this move is the latest in an effort to recognize an increasingly sizable demographic in the state.Pineda says at 13 years old he emigrated alone to the United States. He established legal residency and told Meron he feels blessed to have been able to come here and work. He s served as a district representative on the California State Senate and legislative assistant for the U.S. House of Representatives. He currently is president of the California Latino Leadership Institute, an organization designed for young professionals interested in leadership development and serving their community.A graduate from Cal State Dominguez Hills with a bachelor s degree in sociology and Chicano studies, Medina interned for then-Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, who now serves on the Los Angeles City Council, Pineda says. Medina also organizes immigration forums aimed a helping working-class communities.Pineda says the decision will be announced at the City Council meeting scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday and will become official after being processed by the council.Via: CBS Los Angeles",left-news,"Aug 3, 2015",0,2911

" Zero F*cks Obama Puts Obstructionist GOP On Notice: You Claim To Love Constitution, Then Do Your Job","At a press conference on Tuesday, President Obama could barely hide his frustration towards the would be obstructionists in the Senate who say they will block any potential Supreme Court nominee he suggests for the remainder of his term.When asked by a reporter what he thought about the political move by Republicans to block the process until after the next election, Obama didn t hold back. At times Obama s normally calm rhetorical style gave way to more and more passion as his disbelief in how badly these senators were behaving became apparent. In the past, this has not been viewed as a question. There is no unwritten law that says it can only be done on off years. That s not in the constitutional text. I m amused to hear when people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution, suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there. Republicans have spent the days after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death arguing that Obama should not be allowed to use the next year of his presidency selecting a new nominee. Instead, they have feigned the belief that in the last year in office a president must sit on his hands until the election is over. As Obama points out, this has never been a thing. Notably, as recently as 1988, President Ronald Reagan appointed a new justice during an election year and nobody batted an eye.In a nice little dagger twist, President Obama then put the spotlight back on Republicans who vow to not do their jobs. Rather than allow partisan point scoring get in the way of yet another Democratic process, Obama suggested this could  be a good moment to rise above that  and show America that Congress isn t a complete-and-utter mess. This is the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. It s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics. This will be the opportunity for Senators to do their job.Your job doesn t stop until you are voted out or until your term expires. Obama also used the time to make it abundantly clear that he isn t about to be held hostage by the Republican obstructionists either. In one of the most crackling exchanges of the presser, a reporter asked the President if he would be nominating a moderate so that he might be able to appease Republicans and get them to do their jobs. He was not amused. No. No. Where did you get that idea? Obama reaffirmed that he would be selecting a candidate based on their merit and on the belief that they would be the best person for the job, not on whether or not he thought a group of conservative politicians would like the pick.As is typical in President Obama s second term, this was a take-no-prisoners moment. Having watched Republicans openly vow to stop him from accomplishing anything, even if it meant harming the country as collateral damage, his new strategy is not to even try to work with them. Instead, he has begun to call them out at every term. A name-and-shame scorched earth policy that is making it harder and harder for obstructionists to get a free pass to continue poisoning the political process.It s fun to watch.Featured image via NBC News",News,"February 16, 2016",0,3257
"YIKES! 46,000 DEMOCRATS In Important Blue State Switch Over To GOP…Trump Effect?","This is a state that hasn t always been reliably blue. If this important state ends up being one the GOP could win in November, there is going to be a LOT of panic in at the DNC Nearly 46,000 Pennsylvania Democrats have switched to Republicans since the beginning of the year.According to Penn Live, some experts attribute the mass exodus to Donald Trump.There s even a title for the movement. It s called  Ditch and Switch  and calls for lifelong Democrats to abandon the party, register Republican, and help ensure Trump s place in the general election.Professor of Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, Dr. G. Terry Madonna, tells the paper he has a theory behind the switch. With the increase in support in exit polls for Trump among working class, blue-collar Democrats, it is my belief that these are people who fall into that genre,  said Madonna.The numbers are similar in other states as well. The paper says in Massachusetts, as many as 20,000 Democrats have gone from blue-to-red this year with Trump cited as a primary reason. And in Ohio, as many as 1,000 blue collar workers have promised to switch parties and vote for Trump.Numbers show that some Republicans are also switching to the Democratic party, but nowhere near the numbers that are switching to Republican.

 ‘Most Beautiful Girl In The World’ Is Only Ten – And Already Dealing With Sexist Attacks (IMAGES),"Widely hailed as  the most beautiful girl in the world,  10-year-old Kristina Pimenova is no ordinary child, not by any measure of the word. She has already appeared in photographs by heavyweights in the modeling industry such as Vogue Italia, Dolce & Gabbana, Robert Cavalli, Armani, and others. She also just landed a lucrative contract by the ultra-prestigious agency LA Models, and will be relocating to Los Angeles to further her modeling career at a faster pace than probably any child ever has before.On Instagram Kristina has over 1.2 million followers, and on Facebook she s fast approaching 4 million. But, with success, comes consequences. Already Kristina is being objectified by grown men claiming among other things, that they ll be  waiting  for her. Considering her tagline is  Remember beauty is inside,  it doesn t appear everyone is that deserving.Last year her mother was accused of posting  provocative  and  sexualized  photos of little Kristina, but her mother Glikeriya Pimenova says such accusations are baseless. If anything, people were  paedophiles  if they think her photos made her look like a  babe.  We d have to agree with her. It s not uncommon to go to a swimming pool and see little girls swimming in their bathing suits, or wearing things that little girls simply wear. This is just another example of men accusing beautiful women of being at fault, merely because they find them attractive.It s pretty sick and it s this type of double standard that men have that really needs to be called out   especially because this is a child. Kristina is only ten-years-old and already getting the kind of attention normally reserved for adult women, and it s only going to get worse from here. That s why society needs to be aware of it, and men need to know it s not okay. Let a 10-year-old girl be a kid. Be aware of your inner prejudices that are prone to attack or vilify simply because of your own inner issues, not theirs.#kristinapimenovaA photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Jun 7, 2015 at 7:35pm PDTPic via Instagram.Pic via InstagramKristina is now represented by @lamodels and @newyorkmodels A photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Feb 3, 2016 at 10:24am PST#portosbakery we love this place A photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Nov 25, 2015 at 4:09pm PSTWhile we will admit, adults need to be careful of what images they upload of their children, it s not her fault she s beautiful.Featured image from Instagram.",News,"February 7, 2016",0,2623
TRANSGENDER PRISONER IN CA JAIL FOR MURDER IS GRANTED PAROLE FOR SEX CHANGE,"Just when you find yourself wondering if the world has gone completely mad you read a story like this that confirms that indeed, it has Gov. Jerry Brown is allowing parole for a transgender inmate who is trying to force California to become the first state to pay for sex reassignment surgery.A federal judge in April ordered the state to provide the surgery, which had been scheduled for July. It was delayed after the state appealed.The governor s office said Friday that Brown was taking no action on the Board of Parole Hearings  recommendation to release Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, which means her parole will proceed.The decision makes it less likely that the 51-year-old will be able to have surgery funded by the prison before she is released. Parole board spokesman Luis Patino said it usually takes about a week for an inmate to be released after the governor allows a parole to proceed.Brown decided Norsworthy is no longer dangerous, 30 years after she fatally shot Franklin Gordon Liefer Jr., 26, following an argument in a Fullerton bar in November 1985.Norsworthy, then 21, was convicted of second-degree murder after she shot Liefer three times. He died six weeks later.She is being held at Mule Creek State Prison, a men s prison in Ione, near Sacramento. Prison records refer to her by her birth name of Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy, though she has lived as a woman since the 1990s.She was diagnosed with gender identity disorder in 1999 and began taking female hormones. She began asking the corrections department for the surgery in 2012 after learning a judge for the first time had ordered Massachusetts to provide an inmate with the procedure. However, that decision was overturned on appeal in December, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.The 9th Circuit agreed to hear California s appeal of U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar s ruling and a hearing is scheduled for Thursday. The appellate court noted that the case raises serious legal questions about whether denying the surgery violates Norsworthy s constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment.The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it has met all of its legal requirements by providing Norsworthy with counseling and hormone therapy.The state filed paperwork in federal court Friday saying it has agreed to provide sex reassignment surgery for another inmate, Shiloh Quine, 56, to settle a separate lawsuit. CDCR evaluates every case individually, and in the Quine case, every medical doctor and mental health clinician who has reviewed this case, including two independent mental health experts, determined that this surgery is medically necessary for Quine,  corrections department spokesman Jeffrey Callison said in an emailed statement.Quine, formerly known as Rodney James Quine, is serving a life sentence for murder, kidnapping and robbery.Norsworthy testified at her parole hearing in May that she accepts responsibility for her crime. She said at the time, she was  pretty much drinking every day all day  but is now sober and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in prison.She said she also takes steps to control her anger and make better judgments.Via: FOX News",left-news,"Aug 11, 2015",0,3274
 State Department Official Says Trump Acted like a “Drunk Tourist” in Europe,"President Donald Trump just completed his first foreign trip and the verdict is decidedly mixed as to how well he fared in Europe.

Greece moves asylum-seekers from Lesbos to mainland,"PIRAEUS (Reuters) - Greek authorities on Thursday moved a few hundred asylum-seekers from the island of Lesbos to the mainland in an effort to ease overcrowding in its camps. Thousands of asylum-seekers have become stranded on Lesbos and four other islands close to Turkey since the European Union agreed a deal with Ankara in March 2016 to shut down the route through Greece.  I came to heaven from hell,  said 30-year old Mohammad Firuz, who lived for two months in a state-run camp in Lesbos. Firuz was among 300 people, many of them women and children, aboard a ferry that reached the port of Piraeus early on Thursday morning. The asylum seekers would be taken to camps and apartments in the mainland, authorities said. Lesbos is now hosting some 8,500 asylum-seekers, nearly three times the capacity of state-run facilities.    Violence often breaks out, mainly over delays in asylum procedures and poor living standards. Lesbos residents went on strike earlier this month to protest against European policies they say have turned it into a  prison  for migrants and refugees. ",worldnews,"November 30, 2017 ",1,1134
 Arizona GOP Speaker Invokes 911 To Ban Press From House Floor In Retaliation For Negative Story,"Arizona Speaker of the House David Gowan (R) enacted a new policy to punish members of the press for the fact one of them published a story that exposed him for repeatedly violating state law.The new rule states that any member of the press who wants to cover the legislature from the House floor has to undergo draconian background checks, including examinations of their criminal, civil, and even their driving records. It s absolutely insane that driving records, or other unimportant misdemeanors, can automatically disqualify a member of the press from being on the house floor for up to 10 years.Press members, so far, have refused to consent to these background checks. As a result, they have to now cover the proceedings from the balcony.My view from the house today. floor privileges revoked after reporters declined to sign background check form. pic.twitter.com/4g0lOCdWm0  Alia Beard Rau (@aliarau) April 7, 2016As usual, Republicans want you to think that their use of the government to attack its own citizens is a good thing. Gowan has tried to say that it s  all about safety  when justifying his childish actions   despite that there have been zero incidents in 34 at the Arizona State House that would suggest a policy like this is necessary.Gowan actually invoked 9/11 to justify this garbage: There had never been an attack on 9/11 either, like that occurred either, before on our shore, but it did. Source: Arizona Daily StarRight. We can t be too careful these days because they surprised us on 9/11. I m not sure you can make a more offensive comparison.Here is what caused all this ruckus. Hank Stephenson of the Arizona Capitol Times ran a piece about Gowan s use of a state vehicle during approximately a 20-day period, where he traveled 4,800 miles. Some of the locations he traveled to were related to Gowan s campaign for his election to Congress. After the story ran, Gowan was forced to reimburse the state $12,000 dollars and now he s currently under investigation for further misuse of public resources by the Arizona Attorney General.It s been suggested that this entire charade was done just to get back at Stephenson personally, who was convicted of trespassing after a bar fight a few years ago. The rule immediately screwed over this reporter in a very personal and retaliatory way, along with every other person who might have some issue with which the new rule is at odds.The constitutionality of the new rule is to be determined. A statement by ACLU of Arizona said that the new rule might not be unlawful because it doesn t fully ban the press from the House. It only prevents them from being on the floor. It s a skirting of the constitution that might allow Gowan to get his way, unfortunately.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 10, 2016",0,2859
" Trump Spokeswoman Slips Up, Says Trump’s Immigration Plan Won’t Work (VIDEO)","We are all getting whiplash from Donald Trump s constant flip-flopping on his immigration policy over the last few weeks. Trump had been touting one of the most racist, heartless and problematic solutions to immigration throughout his entire campaign until just a few weeks ago, when he suddenly walked it back and softened his position. That decision confused everyone   and especially angered his equally racist supporters   and Trump has been stuck in a vicious back-and-forth pattern ever since.Last week, Trump said all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. must leave and then get in line to come back to America. This week, he made another  pivot  in his immigration policy, stating that he hasn t ruled out giving some immigrants a path to legalization. When spokesperson Katrina Pierson went on CNN to try to clear things up, it became apparent that everyone in the Trump campaign is confused now.In trying to defend her boss, a struggling Pierson said that it would be impossible for Trump to deport all the undocumented immigrants in America because there could be 2-3 times more immigrants than what the estimates say. Using the usual imaginary statistics that the Trump campaign has become infamous for, she said: We are continuously hearing that there s not 11 million [undocumented immigrants], there could be 20 million, there could be 30 million. This is important because Mr. Trump can t promise to deport every single illegal alien in the country if there s 30 million. While she was speaking, the host noticed that Pierson was absolutely lost and said,  We understand that it s complicated    which only infuriated Pierson and made her raise her voice. But as hard as she tried, Pierson couldn t give any solid reasoning for why Trump s ever-changing policy could work, because the truth is that it won t. The only thing that was cleared up in this interview was the fact that not even Trump s own campaign can keep up with his policy changes.Watch Pierson stumble through this interview below:.@KatrinaPierson on Trump s changing immigration stance: He said from beginning he d be  a negotiator in Congress  https://t.co/G4qVqhxleN  New Day (@NewDay) September 6, 2016Featured image is a screenshot",News,"September 6, 2016",0,2294
PROVOCATION? Republican Senators Introduce New Bill to Move US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem,"21st Century Wire says Donald Trump s campaign  promise  to move the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem could trigger a series of events pushing the region back towards serious conflict. Trump s appointment of right-wing Jewish bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman (image, left) as his ambassador to Israel is seen by many as an aggressive move to promote an ultra-Zionist agenda, as Friedman is a supporter of illegal Israeli settlement expansion in Palestine.Moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem would be in direct violation of numerous other UN resolutions   11 UN Security Council resolutions have ruled that Israel s seizure of East Jerusalem is that of an occupied territory.Hussein Ibish of Foreign Policy Magazine outlines some of the context of this issue in terms of US politics: Among the many alarming ways in which President-elect Donald Trump might upend traditional American foreign policy, one of the most immediate and troubling concerns his pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.Other successful presidential candidates, most notably Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, made the same promise, only, once inaugurated, to emulate all of their predecessors by invoking the executive waiver to the 1995 Congressional Mandate to relocate the embassy. According to Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official and peace negotiator, said that annexing settlements in the West Bank and moving the embassy to Jerusalem might mean the destruction of the peace process as a whole. Naturally, bellicose Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu denied it would inflame any conflict, stating in December that is was  great step forward to peace. Middle East advocate Camille Mansour, told Al-Monitor that the US move would be devastating to relations between Palestinians and Israel, stating: It is a clear abandonment of the corpus-separatum issue, which Jerusalem has enjoyed since before 1947,  he said. A number of consulates were based in Jerusalem   US, Italian, English, Turkish, Spanish, French and Belgian    based on this separate recognition of the city. NOTE:  Corpus-separatum  refers to Jerusalem s observed neutral legal and political status, closely related to that of an independent city-state.This comes on the heals of the recent controversy over the recent UN Security Council Resolution condemning Israeli settlements. Apparently, the UN also followed up the settlement resolution with a plan to track activities of companies doing business in the illegally occupied West Bank.Either way, this latest push by Republicans on behalf of Netanyahu and the Zionist Lobby seems to be a prelude to increased tensions in the Middle East  David Smith The GuardianThree Republican senators have introduced legislation to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s official capital and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv, a plan backed by Donald Trump but likely to ignite fierce protests.After being sworn into the 115th Congress in Washington, Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada and Marco Rubio of Florida unveiled the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act.Similar moves by Republican majorities over the past two decades have come to nought, but this time they have a sympathetic president-elect in Trump. He has repeatedly pledged to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem and nominated a US ambassador who shares that view.Critics warn that the move could unleash a wave of violence and further rattle the Israel-Palestine peace process and the future of a two-state solution.Cruz, runner-up to Trump in the Republican presidential primary, said on Tuesday:  Jerusalem is the eternal and undivided capital of Israel. Unfortunately, the Obama administration s vendetta against the Jewish state has been so vicious that to even utter this simple truth   let alone the reality that Jerusalem is the appropriate venue for the American embassy in Israel   is shocking in some circles.[ ] Rubio added:  Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state of Israel, and that s where America s embassy belongs. It s time for Congress and the president-elect to eliminate the loophole that has allowed presidents in both parties to ignore US law and delay our embassy s rightful relocation to Jerusalem for over two decades.

"Eying snap election, Japan's Abe to focus on education, security","TOKYO (Reuters) - Pledges to spend on education and child care, stay tough on North Korea and revise the pacifist constitution are likely to be pillars of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s campaign in a snap election next month, government sources said on Tuesday. Abe is expected to announce on Monday that he will call a general election on Oct. 22 to take advantage of a rebound in his damaged approval ratings and disarray in the opposition, ruling party and government sources said. The prime minister, whose ratings have recovered from below 30 percent in July, is betting his ruling bloc can at a minimum retain a simple majority in the chamber and at best keep the two-thirds super-majority needed to achieve his long-held goal of revising the constitution to clarify the military s role. A solid victory would boost Abe s chances of a third term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader in a party election next September, putting him on track to become Japan s longest-serving premier.  That is his biggest goal,  said veteran independent political analyst Minoru Morita.  Abe s support rose 6.5 points to 50.3 percent in a poll conducted over the weekend by the Sankei newspaper and the Fuji News Network, while backing for the LDP was at 38 percent compared to 6.4 percent for the main opposition Democratic Party. Abe wants to go ahead with a planned rise in the nation s sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent and use some of the revenue to create a  social security system for all generations , which would invest in education while decreasing the proportion of sales tax revenue used to pay down government debt, the sources said.  Japan s social welfare system is weighted toward spending on the elderly, with people aged 65 and over accounting for a whopping 27.7 percent of the population according to the latest government data.   You can promise anything you want - make a nod toward a more equitable society, empowering women, work-life balance, welfare for all generations,  said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan.  He s got a strategy that is going to win.  Using less tax revenue to pay down debt, however, would make more difficult an already ambitious pledge to balance the budget - excluding debt-servicing and new bond sales - by the year through March 2021. That could in turn raise concerns about less rigid fiscal discipline.  We have to maintain fiscal discipline, regardless,  Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters when asked about reports of such a shift. Abe has said he will decide on a snap election after he returns from the United States on Friday. The opposition Democrats are struggling not only with single-digit support but also a raft of defections. And while the nascent  Japan First  party, which boasts ties to popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, could attract votes, it has yet to draft a platform, pick candidates or formally register as a party. That means the LDP and its junior coalition partner, the Komeito, have a shot at retaining their two-thirds majority in the lower house, political analysts said. However, some analysts believe Abe s electoral base could be undermined by voter distaste over suspected cronyism scandals and concerns about creating a political vacuum even as North Korea raises tensions with its nuclear and missile tests.  I don t dismiss the possibility of the voters giving Abe a nasty surprise,  said Gerry Curtis, professor emeritus at Columbia University in New York. ",worldnews,"September 19, 2017 ",1,3567
Voters in Maine approve expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare,"(Reuters) - Voters in Maine on Tuesday approved a ballot initiative to expand the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare, sending a clear signal of support for the federal healthcare law to lawmakers in the state and Washington D.C.   The approval of the ballot question in Maine comes after Republicans in Washington failed several times over the last few months to pass legislation that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Maine has recently figured prominently in the nation’s debate on how to reform healthcare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, helped block her party’s efforts to repeal Obamacare this year, which angered President Donald Trump.  Maine, which becomes the first U.S. state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, is one of 19 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  About 60 percent of voters in Maine approved the ballot initiative, according to the Bangor Daily News newspaper.   Tuesday’s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.  The state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, staunchly opposes expansion of federal health care insurance, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions.   “I’ve said it before, “free” is very expensive to somebody,” LePage said in a radio address last week.   About 70,000 residents in Maine would be eligible for the state’s Medicaid program when and if state officials certify the results of the election. Lawmakers could vote to repeal or alter the referendum, much like they have recently for several citizen-initiated referendums, the Bangor Daily News reported.   “It is now the responsibility and the duty of the governor and the legislature to fully and faithfully implement this law,” the state’s Speaker of the House, Sara Gideon, said in a statement.  The Legislature’s Office of Fiscal and Program Review in Maine estimated that expansion of Medicaid would cost the state about $55 million and bring in about $525 million of federal money to the state each year, according to the Bangor Daily News.

" KKK Members Showed Up At Nevada Caucus With Pro-Donald Trump Signs (PHOTOS, TWEETS)","Donald Trump s surging presidential campaign attracted some more unwanted attention at a caucus site in Nevada on Tuesday night when some people dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes showed up.

She noted that  Volunteers asked caucus goers to ignore them. The host said the couple claimed to be Trump supporters, but she suspected they were counter-Trump protesters:  Uhm, guys? Do I think they re ACTUAL #Trump supporters? Probably not. Did they say they were? Yes. Was picture taken at #NVCaucus? Yes. When some of her followers noted that the sign held by one of the people said  New England,  Heath indicated that the  woman in photo is wearing a Clark County GOP voting sticker. This was #NVCaucus. It is unclear whether the people in the Klan photos are actual Klan members or protesters attempting to make a point of Trump courting racist voters.Nevada State Senator Aaron D.

 New Information Shows Comey’s Campaign-Ending Clinton FBI Probe Was COMPLETELY Political (DETAILS),"We are stuck with Donald Trump as the most dangerous and incompetent president in history for either the next four years or until he is impeached. If he is impeached, we re stuck with a bona fide theocrat in Mike Pence. It didn t have to be this way, though, and we quite possibly have one man to thank for it: Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey.By now, we are all aware that the insane probe into Hillary Clinton s private email server was closed in July. Despite much GOP hand-wringing, it was found that there was nothing to see there. However, despite his decision not to pursue criminal charges, Comey took an unprecedented step and held a press conference telling the American people that Hillary was reckless in her actions in a scathing rebuke that, of course, would turn voters who were on the fence against her. In addition to that, just eleven days out from Election Day, Comey sent a letter to Congress, which of course made it into the press, saying that he may be re-opening the probe due to some nonsense about Hillary s aide, Huma Abedin, and her husband Anthony Weiner s computer in a completely unrelated investigation. Of course, nothing was there, but the damage was already done. This could very well be what tipped the election in favor of Donald Trump in the minds of undecided voters. After all, plenty of people made up their minds at the last minute.One attorney is, quote,  appalled  at Comey s actions. After filing a Freedom of Information Act request to have the warrant for Hillary s emails released, Randy Schoenberg of Los Angeles, California, says of what the FBI Director did, via USA Today: I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between  Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown  why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant,  he said.  I am appalled.  The FBI s Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Brian Fallon, who of course was a Clinton campaign official, echoed these sentiments via Twitter, saying that unsealed filings regarding Huma s emails reveals Comey s intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time. So, in other words, it is very possible that Comey did this in an effort to tip the scales in Trump s favor. Then again, considering that there was an entire article written during the campaign saying that the  FBI is Trumpland, this really should be no surprise whatsoever. If they wanted to tilt things to Trump, they had the perfect way to do it, especially considering all of the horrible news coming out about Trump.These revelations are especially damning, considering that it has now been revealed that the FBI withheld information regarding an investigation into Trump and his campaign s ties to Russia. To that end, Comey definitely messed with our democracy in what is beginning to look like a criminal act. They hated Hillary so much at the FBI that the director himself manipulated the electoral process to give us a Trump presidency.James Comey needs to be investigated himself, but of course that isn t going to happen under a GOP White House, Department of Justice, and Congress.Shame on you, Director Comey. Representative Maxine Waters was right   you have no credibility, and should resign immediately.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"February 22, 2017",0,3835
 Spicer Quickly Orders Press Briefing To Be OFF Camera After Trump’s Indefensible Morning Meltdown,"Watching the healthcare bill he staked his entire presidency on flame out in the Senate seems to have broken Trump s brain. Within 24 hours, he was on Twitter having a spittle-laden meltdown over the negative coverage he s been receiving. Two articles   one by the New York Times and the other by the Washington Post   seem to have pushed him over the edge.First, there was the New York Times, which found a number of Senate Republicans willing to call him a moron:Senate Republican leadership has made it known that it would much rather negotiate with Mr. Pence than a president whose candidacy many did not even take seriously during the 2016 primaries. And some of the White House s efforts have clearly been counterproductive.Then there was the Washington Post, which discovered that Trump had photoshopped a picture of himself onto the cover TIME magazine and hung it in his golf courses.The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least five of President Trump s clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump. Donald Trump: The  Apprentice  is a television smash!  the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps:  TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV! But that wasn t true.The Time cover is a fake.There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time magazine. And there was no issue at all in 2009 that had Trump on the cover.So Trump being Trump promptly lost his mind.The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017Trump s attack on the Washington Post was particularly insane, not just because he seemingly invented the term  guardian of Amazon,  but that he demanded Amazon pay a non-existent  internet tax    the price for Amazon s owner also owning the Washington Post. It s how a particularly nasty dictator in a particularly nasty banana republic might behave. Hate the message, go after the messenger and everyone the messenger associates with. It confirms much of what Trump s critics have been saying: Trump is at war with the free press.How will the administration defend Trump s meltdown? By hiding.

"Half of Britons support a second vote on Brexit, poll finds","LONDON (Reuters) - Half of Britons support a second vote on whether to leave the European Union and a majority think the government may be paying too much money to the EU to open the way to trade talks, according to a new opinion poll.    The poll, published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, found 50 percent of people supported another vote on the final terms of Britain s exit deal, 34 percent rejected another referendum and 16 percent said they did not know. The newspaper said it was the first major opinion poll since last week s media reports that Britain is preparing to pay about 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to help to move on to talks on a future trade pact with the EU. Mike Smithson, an election analyst who runs the www.politicalbetting.com website and a former Liberal Democrat politician, said on Twitter it was  the first time any pollster has recorded backing  for a second Brexit referendum. Since the referendum in 2016, high profile opponents of Britain s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron, to former British prime minister Tony Blair and billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be disastrous for the British economy. Blair said on Sunday he was trying to reverse Brexit because claims by the leave campaign, such as the National Health Service getting an extra 350 million pounds a week once Britain leaves the EU, have been proved false. Blair told the BBC that the government aims in the Brexit negotiations will fail because it wants to leave the single market, but retain all of the benefits, and voters can change their minds.  It s reversible. It s not done until it s done,  he said.  When the facts change, I think people are entitled to change their mind.  Brexit supporters argue any attempt to halt the exit process would be anti-democratic. According to the Survation poll only 11 percent of voters said Britain should pay 50 billion pounds to quit the EU, while 31 percent said the government should not pay anything at all.   The poll also found 35 percent of those surveyed said they would be worse off financially after Brexit, while 14 percent said they would be better off. The online poll, carried out by research firm Survation, interviewed 1,003 adults in Britain between 30 November and 1 December. Survation said it carries out polls for media organizations including the BBC, Sky News, the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian. The polling agency correctly predicted a narrowing in the vote between the ruling Conservative party and the opposition Labour Party in this summer s general election that resulted in May leading a minority government.

 Satanists Brilliantly Troll Anti-Gay Baker By Requesting A Birthday Cake For Lucifer (VIDEO),"Christian cake baker Jack Phillips gained national infamy when he violated Colorado s non-discrimination law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple s wedding. He was subsequently sued, and now his case is headed to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, with the current makeup of the court and Donald Trump s administration in place, it is quite likely that discrimination will be codified into law. Nonetheless, The Satanic Temple has come up with a brilliant way to point out that religious freedom cuts both ways: By having these bigoted bakers make cakes for Satan.Jack Phillips has already had his first request via email from a Satanist seeking to celebrate Satan. It reads:Dear Mr PhillipsI would like to get a quote on a birthday cake, for a special event. It is a cake that is religious in theme, and since religion is a protected class, I am hoping that you will gladly bake this cake. As you see the birthday cake in question is to celebrate the birthday of Lucifer, or as they are also known Satan who was born as Satan when he was cast from heaven by God. The cake only needs to be a simple 9 13 single layer cake, with red and black icing. As well as to contain an upside down cross, under the head of Lucifer. And I thought I would seek you out, to bake this cake since you appear to be a very moral person since you refused to bake a cake for same sex couples. And since religion is a protected class, I hope you will be willing to bake this cake, so my small group of religious friends can celebrate the birthday of Lucifer this coming November, just a few days after Halloween.Sincerely,(Name redacted)Here is a sample cake posted to Twitter by The Satanic Temple s co-founder, Lucien Greaves:Did you know: bakers can't refuse service to The Satanic Temple because religion is a ""protected class""? #SatanCakes pic.twitter.com/9VrVndkbSi  Lucien Greaves (@LucienGreaves) September 26, 2017The whole point here is not to torment bakers or anyone else. It is to point out that if you own a business that is open to the public, you may not discriminate, period. Now, at the federal level there are no non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. However, religion   EVERY religion   is a protected class. If Jack Phillips or anyone else refuses the Satanists their cakes, this will be an open and shut court case.Mr. Phillips, it would have been a hell of a lot easier if you had just baked the damn wedding cake.Here is video of the Temple s co-founder explaining his position:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 15, 2017",0,2629
"Rosneft's Sechin a no-show as witness in bribery trial again, ordered to appear next week","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin again failed to show up as a witness at the bribery trial of a former Russian economy minister on Wednesday, prompting the judge to order him to appear next week. Sechin, boss of Russia s biggest oil company and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, had told the court he would be unavailable for the rest of the year. He is a key witness in the trial of Alexei Ulyukayev, who was arrested last year after a late night meeting in Sechin s office. Ulyukayev faces up to 15 years in prison, accused of accepting $2 million from Sechin in return for approving the sale of a state-controlled oil company to Rosneft. Police detained him inside Rosneft headquarters shortly after Sechin handed him the cash. Ulyukayev denies the accusations and says he was framed by Sechin. His lawyers say their client cannot testify in court prior to Sechin s testimony as a witness.  All of us are here thanks to witness Sechin,  Ulyukayev s lawyer Timofei Gridnev told the court after Sechin failed to appear on Wednesday. Gridnev said it was the third time Sechin had ignored a summons to appear. Judge Larisa Semyonova read out a letter from Sechin s lawyers saying he would be unable to attend for the rest of the year due to his tight schedule, but she nevertheless summoned him for next Monday. Rosneft made clear later on Wednesday that chances its boss would appear in court on Monday were rather slim.  This hunt for Sechin discredits the court. Sechin is not the accused one,  Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev told Reuters.  All this shouting of Sechin s name in court and these dates are trash.  Before his arrest, Ulyukayev was one of the leading figures in a faction of economic liberals who argued for less state control over the economy. Sechin is widely seen as the main champion of the opposite view, that the state should consolidate its grip, particularly over the energy sector that provides a large share of Russia s state revenue through its two biggest companies, Rosneft and Gazprom. Ulyukayev had opposed last year s sale of the medium-sized oil company Bashneft to Rosneft. But prosecutors say he signed off on the deal and then took the cash from Sechin. Sechin missed Wednesday s hearings because he is on a business trip to western Siberia, where on Tuesday he attended the opening of a new Rosneft oil field. On Wednesday, he met a regional governor and chaired a meeting with Rosneft s management in the Siberian city of Khanty-Mansiisk, Rosneft said. ",worldnews,"November 22, 2017 ",1,2614
"U.S. retaliates against Russia, orders closure of consulate, annexes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has told Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and buildings in Washington and New York that house trade missions, the State Department said on Thursday, in retaliation for Moscow cutting the U.S. diplomatic presence in Russia. The announcement was the latest in tit-for-tat measures between the two countries that have helped to drive relations to a new post-Cold War low, thwarting hopes on both sides that they might improve after U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Last month, Moscow ordered the United States to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in Russia by more than half, to 455 people to match the number of Russian diplomats in the United States, after Congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions against Russia. The sanctions were imposed in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and to punish Russia further for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.  We believe this action was unwarranted and detrimental to the overall relationship between our countries,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the United States had completed the reduction.  In the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians,  Nauert said, the United States has required the Russian government to close its San Francisco consulate and two annexes in Washington, D.C. and New York by Sept. 2. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of the closures in a phone call on Thursday, a senior Trump administration official said. The two men plan to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September, the official said. Lavrov expressed regret about Washington s decision during the phone call with Tillerson, his ministry said.  Moscow will closely study the new measures announced by the Americans, after which our reaction will be conveyed,  the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. The latest U.S. move caps eight months of back-and-forth retaliatory measures between the two countries spanning two U.S. administrations. In December, the administration of Barack Obama closed two Russian countryside vacation retreats in Maryland and New York, saying the compounds had been used for intelligence-related purposes. The closures were part of a broader response, including the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies, to what U.S. officials have called cyber interference by Moscow in the 2016 elections. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Trump came into office wanting to improve relations with Russia, a desire that was hamstrung by the election interference allegations. The new sanctions passed by Congress conflicted with Trump s goals, but he grudgingly signed them into law this month. The United States said last week that it would have to sharply scale back visa services in Russia, a move that will hit Russian business travelers, tourists and students. The Russian consulate in San Francisco handles work from seven states in the Western United States. There are three other Russian consulates separate from the embassy in Washington. They are in New York, Seattle and Houston. The consulate in San Francisco is the oldest and most established of Russia s consulates in the United States, the senior Trump administration official told reporters. An official residence at the consulate will also be closed. No Russian diplomats are being expelled, and the diplomats assigned to San Francisco can be re-assigned to other posts in the United States, the official said. The Russians can continue to retain ownership of any of the closed facilities, or sell them, but will not be allowed to carry out diplomatic activities there, the official said.  Even after these closures, Russia will still maintain more diplomatic and consular annexes in the United States than we have in Russia,  the official said.  We ve chosen to allow the Russian government to maintain some of its annexes in an effort to arrest the downward spiral in our relationship.  ",worldnews,"August 31, 2017 ",1,4208
 Even Trump’s New Campaign Manager Demanded He Release His Taxes (VIDEO),"The problem with running for President in the 21st Century is that nearly everyone has a Google page or 1,000 about them, and often, video to back it up. That s the case with Kellyanne Conway, who was named Donald Trump s new campaign manager in his second attempt to shake things up.In April, Conway appeared on CNN, where host Don Lemon asked her about an  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz. Conway, who wasn t working for Trump, or apparently even supporting Trump, at the time, thought the alliance was fine, but Trump s refusal to release his taxes wasn t.Then head of a super-PAC supporting Trump rival Ted Cruz, Conway was asked in an April 25 CNN interview if the  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz was fair.  Of course it s fair game,  she said.  Oh absolutely. It s completely transparent. Donald Trump s tax returns aren t, and I would like to see those be transparent.

She also sharply critiqued the businessman in the past over Trump University, his use of personal insults, and simply  saying things that aren t true,  the left-leaning group said.Source: The HillIn other words, it s becoming increasingly clear that Trump surrogates souls can be bought and sold, although it s not clear for how much.

SERIOUSLY INJURED Cop Sues Black Lives Matter…Does He Have A Case?,"This group of Black Lives Matter supporters marched at the Minnesota State Fair chanting,  Pigs in a blanket, fry  em like bacon!

He also said in a YouTube video that he was only affiliated with  the spirit of justice. Don t affiliate me with nothing,  he said.  Yeah, I was also a Nation of Islam member, I m not affiliated with it  They ll try to put you with ISIS or some other terrorist group   no. Among the five BLM members named in the suit is DeRay Mckesson, 31, a former school administrator turned civil rights activist.The suit claims that Mckesson, who took part in nightly protests after Sterling s death on July 5, was  in charge of  a march on July 9 that turned into a  riot.

" Trump: If I’m Elected, I’ll Appoint Justices Who Will Destroy Marriage Equality","The nightmare that is Donald Trump just keeps barreling on, and there seems to be no end in sight. In fact, it seems that he just might become the GOP nominee for the 2016 presidential election. There are endless reasons that this is beyond scary, and he has given us yet another.Earlier this week, Trump showed just how ignorant he is of the law in a bumbling interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC s This Week. The host didn t go easy on Trump in a conversation about the Supreme Court and the appointment of justices, and Trump showed himself to be utterly unqualified to be in any position of political power, much less president of the United States and leader of the free world. Here is a transcript of the exchange, courtesy of The New Civil Rights Movement:STEPHANOPOULOS: Let s talk about some of the issues. Judges. What kind of judges will you appoint? Will they be conservative?What does that mean to you and how will you ensure it?TRUMP: Well, first of all, we have a lot of judges that have to be appointed because we have a lot of openings in terms of judges. And I m very happy about that, to be honest, because I think, you know, appointing judges is a very important and a very, frankly, a very, very important element of what we re doing.STEPHANOPOULOS: But Ted Cruz says he s going to appoint rock rib conservatives with a paper trail. What are you going to do?TRUMP: Well, I m going to appoint conservative judges. I m going to appoint people that have great reputations, that are great with the legal profession STEPHANOPOULOS: Like?TRUMP: Well, I can say like any   you know a judge who is a totally underrated and not spoken is Justice Thomas. I mean, if you look at   if you look at some of the judges that we have like on the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives. I mean STEPHANOPOULOS: But how are you going to TRUMP: Wait, let me first say. Ted Cruz, was the one that really wanted Justice Roberts to go on the Supreme Court. You know that, right? Have you heard that?STEPHANOPOULOS: So, how are you going to make sure you don t get a Justice Roberts? Are you going to ask your appointees TRUMP: Well, excuse me, excuse me, how are they going to make sure? Bush appointed him. And Cruz was the biggest advocate. Cruz fought like hell to get Justice Roberts in there. Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster. He turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare. So, you tell me, ask Cruz, why did he push STEPHANOPOULOS: I m asking you. How are you going to make sure?TRUMP: No, I m asking you, why did he push so hard to have a judge who has absolutely set the conservative movement back and said everything STEPHANOPOULOS: When I interview him, I ll ask him. How you re going to make sure you don t get betrayed by your appointees.TRUMP: I will study it carefully. I will work with people that I respect, conservative people, and we ll appoint judges that will be good. And I don t think I ll have any catastrophic appointment like Justice Roberts, which was really more than anybody else, pushed by Cruz and Bush.With this level of incompetency on full display for all to see, Trump went on Fox News Sunday to redeem himself on the same issue and this time, he did what every Republican does when trying to woo audiences and cover up for mistakes: he turned the discussion to those Fox viewers hate the most: LGBT people. In fact, Trump says that if he is elected president, the justices on his Supreme Court will be those who oppose marriage equality, and he would find a way to have them throw out the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that made equal marriage the law of the land.First, Trump dodged the question, simply telling host Chris Wallace: They have ruled on it. I wish it was done by the states. Wallace didn t let Trump off the hook though, and plowed on, finally forcing Trump to say to the conservative audience on the issue of justices who would overturn the marriage equality decision: I would strongly consider that, yes. There you have it, folks. We knew Trump was a bigot, but he had never come out and said he d actively work to roll back LGBT right on this level. Not surprising at all, though. Just another reason to make sure his fantasy of ruling America never becomes a reality.Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 31, 2016",0,4429
Hillary Clinton wins Missouri Democratic primary: Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has won the Missouri primary, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, with rival Bernie Sanders conceding the contest. Results for the contest, which was held on Tuesday, were slow to roll in because of the razor-thin margin separating the number of votes received by Clinton and Sanders. Ultimately, Clinton’s win was declared by just 1,531 votes.  The Sanders campaign had previously weighed the option to request a recount in the tight race, but in an interview with the AP, Sanders said he would “prefer to save the taxpayers of Missouri some money,” as the winner is awarded just two additional delegates of the otherwise nearly evenly split spread.

 GOP Consultant Tells Black Reporter She Wants To Choke Him For Calling Out Republican Racism (VIDEO),"Yes, this actually happened.During a panel discussion on Meet The Press on Sunday, Detroit Free Press reporter Stephen Henderson explained how Republicans are not believable when they try to distance themselves from Donald Trump s racist hate speech because they have been doing it for decades in coded language and through the policies they push.There s also a substantive credibility problem here,  Henderson said. I mean, you have Republicans saying,  Trump is not one of us.  And yet, a lot of the things that he s saying are said in coded language by other Republicans. I wrote a column last week about Paul Ryan, for instance, saying,  This is not a party that preys on people s prejudices. And yet, you can think of lots of examples of Republicans doing exactly that, going back to Ronald Reagan, giving a states  rights speech in Neshoba County, Mississippi, in 1980. This goes on all the time in coded ways. Trump is saying some of these things more explicitly. And that makes them, you know, it makes you uncomfortable too And that made the old conservative white lady next to Henderson angry, so she expressed her desire to choke him because how dare he call out Republicans for being racist, and what about all those poor white supremacists who people unfairly refer to as bigots? No, it doesn t make me uncomfortable, it just makes me want to choke you because it s ridiculous and it s the creation of Trump,  said former Reagan and George W. Bush consultant Mary Matalin. Because conservatives do not consider themselves bigots or homophobes or misogynists, okay? What Cruz won at CPAC, and he won overwhelmingly, he is expanding the electorate by bringing like-minded libertarians, young people. Trump is expanding the electorate by getting people who are sick of being called bigots, because they want to secure the border. This is not a race race, okay? Let s not go there. Let that sink in for a second. Matalin actually expects us to believe that conservatives are not the racist, sexist homophobes that we all see them as   even though they have persecuted gays with anti-gay laws and hateful rhetoric, persecuted women with draconian laws meant to take away a woman s right to make decisions about their own reproductive health along with denying women pay equality, and have made it quite clear that they hate black people due to the way they have treated the first black president over the last seven years. And that s just the tip of the iceberg.Henderson laughed at Matalin s desire to choke him, however, it didn t sound like she was joking. But he responded anyway, in disagreement, of course. I think it is. I mean, I think there s no question that what he is doing is appealing to race. And Republicans have done that for a long time. Here s the video via Crooks and Liars.I m sure the Republican Party is pleased that at least one of their pawns is still brainwashed enough to believe that conservatives are somehow a diverse lot who care about the plight of women, minorities, and gay people even though the GOP has done nothing to help any of these groups. All they have done is attack them in an effort to take away their rights, and if they had their way, Henderson wouldn t be allowed to speak unless a white person gave him permission to do so.

Myanmar army chief urges internally displaced to return to Rakhine,"SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Myanmar s army chief called on Thursday for people internally displaced by violence in Rakhine State to go home and rebuild communities, but he made no mention of 422,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh to escape his force s operations. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in a major speech on his plans for Rakhine state on his first visit there since the latest strife erupted, said the military had handled the situation as best as it could after a wave of coordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Aug. 25. The United Nations has said the military response to the insurgent attacks is ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing the Rohingya Muslim community out of Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces are waging a legitimate campaign against Muslim terrorists who have been attacking and torching villages of Buddhists and other non-Muslims, some 30,000 of whom were internally displaced. Min Aung Hlaing did not mention the accusation of ethnic cleansing in his speech to business people, officials and some of the displaced, in Sittwe, the state capital.  Regarding the rehabilitation of villages of our national races, for the national races who fled their homes, first of all they must go back to their places,  he said.  National races  is a Myanmar term referring to members of officially recognized indigenous ethnic groups who make up the diverse nation. The Rohingya are not recognized as a  national race , and are instead seen as illegal immigrants and denied citizenship. Animosity between Buddhists in Rakhine state and the Rohingya goes back generations, but has seethed in recent years, fueled in part by a surge of Buddhist nationalism since nearly five decades of strict military rule came to an end.  The important thing is to have our people in the region. It s necessary to have control of our region with our national races,  Min Aung Hlaing said.  We can t do anything if there are no people from our national races ... that is their rightful place.  Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to the return of Muslims to their villages in the north of the state, almost half of which have been abandoned and torched. The crisis has drawn international condemnation and calls from the United Nations and U.S. President Donald Trump for the military to stop the violence and support diplomatic efforts for a long-term solution for the Rohingya. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, in her first address to the nation on the crisis on Tuesday, said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process to take back refugees, under a 1993 arrangement with Bangladesh.  Refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem,  she said. Min Aung Hlaing did not mention the return of refugees from Bangladesh.    ",worldnews,"September 21, 2017 ",1,2846
Vietnam protests over Chinese live-fire drills in South China Sea,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam on Tuesday issued a strong condemnation of Chinese military live-fire exercises in the disputed South China Sea, amid rising tension between the two countries. The Maritime Safety Administration of China s southern province of Hainan, which oversees the South China Sea, said last month there would be live fire drills around the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam claims, until September 2.  Vietnam strongly objects this action by China and seriously requests China to respect Vietnam s sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelagos,  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement.  Vietnam once again asserts that (we) will resolutely protect our sovereignty and our legitimate rights and interests in the East Sea (South China Sea) through peaceful measures that are suitable with international laws,  the statement said. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims. Tension between China and neighboring Vietnam is at its highest in three years over the disputed waters. Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China in July under pressure from Beijing. China has appeared uneasy at Vietnam s efforts to rally Southeast Asian countries over the South China Sea as well as at its growing defense relationships with the United States, Japan and India.

OBAMA NOMINATES FIRST MUSLIM FOR FEDERAL BENCH: Can A Devout Muslim Rule Without Including Sharia Law In His Decision?,"President Obama is clearly not quite ready to go  gentle into that good night.  As he moves towards the end of his second term as President of the United States, Obama is still firmly in the driver s seat. Obama announced a nomination for a federal judge on Wednesday, and that nomination is historic. Washington lawyer Abid Riaz Qureshi will become the first Muslim federal judge to hold that seat if his nomination is confirmed.Obama released a statement about Qureshi s nomination that read in part, according to CNN:I am pleased to nominate Mr. Qureshi to serve on the United States District Court bench. I am confident he will serve the American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice. Qureshi is a Washington-area lawyer who has been a partner at the law firm of Lathan & Watkins LLP, where he has spent the entirety of his legal career. The Pakistani-born Qureshi, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1997, has specialized in cases involving securities violations, False Claims Act, and health care fraud. He has served on the District of Columbia Bar Association s Legal Ethics Committee since 2015, and from 2006-2012 served as co-chair of the Litigation Department in Washington.

 Trump Brags About How Powerful America’s Nuclear Arsenal Is In Scary Twitter Post,"Donald Trump continued escalating his rhetoric on nuclear weapons Wednesday morning in a boast that should concern every American.The reality of a potential nuclear holocaust hasn t been this worrisome since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Except the threat isn t coming from the Russians this time, but our own president.On Tuesday, Trump threatens to rain  fire and fury  upon North Korea, which resulted in Kim Jong-Un threatening to bomb Guam.Trump s irresponsible threats made the country gasp in horror. After all, Trump has been obsessed with nuclear weapons since the 2016 campaign and is mentally unstable enough that he may actually use them to retaliate against even the smallest personal slight against him.Hillary Clinton was right when she warned that,  A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. On Wednesday morning, Trump bragged about America s nuclear arsenal on his Twitter feed and promised that America would remain the most powerful nation on Earth because of it. He even had the audacity to claim that he is responsible for the renovation of the arsenal.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017 Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017For the record, it was President Obama who ordered a sweeping renovation of America s nuclear arsenal in 2014. So once again, Trump gets caught taking credit for something President Obama did.In addition, Donald Trump must not be aware that Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States.And, finally, America s nuclear arsenal does not make us the most powerful nation in the world. It now makes us the number one threat against it because of Trump.Forcing Trump out of office has never been more important than it is right now. Because failure to do so could result in trying to survive a nuclear apocalypse caused by a petulant child.Read more:Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 9, 2017",0,2265
HILARIOUS! Look Who LIBERAL Middlebury Professor Is Blaming After She Was Sent To Hospital By Angry Mob Of Leftist Students,"Two weeks ago at Middlebury College, Charles Murray needed a safe space   literally.In a significant escalation of the campus speech wars, protesters hooted down the conservative scholar in a lecture hall and then roughed up a Middlebury faculty member escorting him to a car.The Middlebury administration commendably tried to do the right thing and stand by Murray s right to be heard, but was overwhelmed by a yowling mob with all the manners and intellectual openness of a gang of British soccer hooligans.The students who brought in Charles Murray framed the evening as  an invitation to argue,  and in that spirit asked Professor Allison Stanger, a Democrat in good standing, to serve as Murray s interlocutor. When chanting students commandeered the lecture hall, Stanger and Murray repaired to another room for a livestreamed discussion.Protesters found the room and pounded on the windows and pulled fire alarms. When Murray and Stanger exited at the end of the livestream and headed for their getaway car, protesters assailed them. They shoved and grabbed Stanger, who was shaken up and later went to the hospital, and pounded on the car and tried to obstruct it. She was recently diagnosed with a concussion that she suffered during the liberal beating by Middlebury students.Stanger wrote afterward that she  feared for my life. And for what offense? Talking to someone who thinks differently than the average Middleburg faculty member or student.Allison Stanger invited Charles Murray, famous for The Bell Curve, to speak at the school. Students were so outraged Murray had to flee for his life, and Stanger got beaten up. Her response?It s Trump s fault!During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, student Red Guards forced professors to make self-confessions. This situation was clearly different, however, as most of the students were not Chinese.Stanger is smart. She doesn t have to deal with Donald Trump at her school, but she does have to deal with her fellow leftist faculty members and leftist students. She s trying to make kissy-kissy with them so they don t smack her in the head again.If I were in her position, I d probably do the same thing. On the other hand, Vermont is a concealed carry state, so maybe there could be another option when faced with a life-threatening leftist mob.Exit question:1) When someone goes to an emergency room with throbbing head pains and a hardcore leftist worldview, how can an E.R. doctor determine whether the patient has a head injury or simply a very rigid ideological point of view?   American ThinkerSo in summary, the leftist professor who s made it her mission to indoctrinate Middlebury students, is now blaming President Trump because those same students she encouraged to think and behave like leftists, behaved in a way that is compatible with how leftists behave.  Using  violence and threatening behavior to get your way and drown out the opposing voices is nothing new for leftists, they ve just taken it a significant notch since Obama took office 8 years ago.

Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau launches case against sister agency,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian investigators on Tuesday said they had opened a criminal case into suspected extortion by officials at a sister anti-corruption agency, based partly on information from a whistleblower who also implicated the president s office. The National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NAZK) is a keystone of Western-backed reforms but has been criticized for making slow progress with its main task of verifying officials  wealth declarations for evidence of ill-gotten gains. NABU - a sister agency investigating high-profile corruption cases - said it opened the case against NAZK officials on suspicion they received  undue benefits in especially large amounts, combined with the extortion of such benefits.  Officials at other state bodies are also being investigated, a NABU spokeswoman said, without giving further details. While details of the case are not yet clear, the fact that a state-run anti-corruption agency is itself being investigated for corruption suggests the authorities still have progress to make in their promised drive to eliminate graft. The NABU spokeswoman said the case was opened on Nov. 10 partly due to information from the former head of NAZK s financial control department, Hanna Solomatina. Earlier on Tuesday, Solomatina said she had decided to resign and hand over evidence to NABU after realizing an online wealth declaration tool managed by NAZK was compromised.  In reality, the e-declarations system is used to cover officials loyal to the authorities ... and for the self-enrichment of the head of NAZK and NAZK members,  Solomatina said in a briefing.  NAZK is not an independent body, but is completely controlled by the authorities,  she said.  She described how she had been summoned to the administration of President Petro Poroshenko and told NAZK s decisions should first be checked with the president s office. In a statement, the presidential administration denied Solomatina s allegations.  We have no way to influence the work of NAZK,  it said. NAZK also denied Solomatina s account and said it would lodge a claim in court to refute her comments.  We stress that the widespread information of the ex-official (Solomatina), without concrete facts, is a personal attack on the chairperson, members and staff of the state agency  and an attempt to discredit successfully launched anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,  it said. Following the ouster of a Moscow-backed president in 2014, Ukraine s new pro-Western authorities promised to root out graft and modernize the economy in exchange for billions of dollars in international funding. But Ukraine s backers have seen a failure to bring corrupt lawmakers and senior officials to justice as an indication the authorities may lack the commitment to eliminate the power of vested interests.

"Pope to meet top Buddhist monks in Myanmar, address military","VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will meet Myanmar s top Buddhist monks, its military generals and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in November when he visits that country and Bangladesh, both caught up in a crisis over the Rohingya Muslim minority.   According to a full program of the Nov. 26-Dec. 2 trip released by the Vatican on Tuesday, the pope will say two Masses in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and one in Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim. Francis will be the first pope to visit Myanmar and the second to visit Bangladesh, where Pope John Paul visited in 1986. The pope arrives in Yangon, the country s largest city, on Nov. 27 after a flight of more than 10 hours and is scheduled to rest for about 24 hours before heading to the country s capital Naypyitaw for a day.   There, he will have separate private talks with President Htin Kyaw and Suu Kyi, who is both State Counsellor and Foreign Minister, making her effectively the country s civilian leader.   A senior Vatican official said military leaders are expected to attend a separate, public meeting where the pope will address politicians and diplomats. This is where he is expected to give the keynote speech of the trip.   Myanmar is facing international scrutiny over the plight of its Rohingya community. In February, Francis said they had been tortured and killed simply because they wanted to live their culture and Muslim faith.   Last August, some hard-line Buddhists were riled with the pope spoke about  the persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters  and asked Catholics to pray for them, adding that they should be given  their full rights .   On Nov. 29, the pope will address the Sangha Maha Nayaka, the country s highest Buddhist authority, which is a government-backed panel of senior monks responsible for regulating the Buddhist clergy.   The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday that Bangladesh border guards reported more than 11,000 Rohingya refugees crossing into their country from Myanmar on Monday alone..   The government offensive has drawn international condemnation and U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing, which the government denies.   There are about 700,000 Roman Catholics in Myanmar according to the country s cardinal, Charles Maung Bo, out of a population of about 51.4 million.   Catholics make up a tiny minority in Bangladesh. Francis will be the second pope to visit that country, after Pope John Paul in 1986. (This refiled version of the story adds dropped numeral in second paragraph Nov 26 instead of 6).

 Chicago Police Caught On Camera Assaulting Black Female Pastor (VIDEO),"One night in 2013, Reverend Catherine Brown turned down the alley that leads to the driveway of her Chicago home, just as she had done many times before. Her two small children were in the back of her vehicle.As she came around the curve, Rev. Brown encountered a vehicle heading straight toward her on the narrow alleyway. Her first instinct was to slam on the horn, as she quickly brought her own car to a stop.Before Brown knew what was happening, Chicago police officer Michelle Morsi Murphy jumped from the other vehicle and immediately began hurling obscenities at the young mother.According to Brown, she was shocked by the officer s aggressive actions.  As she reached for driver s license, a second officer, Jose Lopez, got out of the vehicle and pointed a gun at her head.Not knowing what else to do, the terrified pastor called 911 asking for a supervisor to be sent to the location.According to CBS in Chicago, which obtained a copy of Brown s 911 call, the recordings  reveal she felt threatened and in danger. They also show that  She repeatedly asks for a lieutenant and police to come and help. CBS Chicago also reports that  her daughters  screams can be heard on the calls. Instead of waiting for a supervisor to arrive, Murphy and Lopez attempted to force the door of Brown s vehicle open.The terrified pastor put her car in reverse and backed out of the alley, hoping to reach an area where witnesses might see what was taking place.The two Chicago police officers pursued Brown s vehicle.Dashcam footage shows that, once she was out of the alley, Brown brought her own vehicle to a complete stop again.The cops plowed directly into Brown s car, showing a complete lack of concern for the two children in the backseat.At this point Brown got out of her car and began shouting for witnesses.Officer Lopez then pepper-sprayed the terrified woman directly in the face, also spraying her one-year-old baby in the process. Officer Murphy can be seen laughing.Murphy then jumped on top of a car which was parked on the street, next to Brown s vehicle, aiming her gun directly at the woman.Another officer appeared at this point. He charged onto the scene, hitting Brown s car with a metal object.The entire gang of Chicago police officers then tackled the unarmed mother, beating and kicking her. They beat me down to my underwear,  Brown told CBS Chicago.  They tore my skirt off. They beat me with their batons, kicked me with their boots. Between the two of them, officers Murphy and Lopez have a total of 30 excessive force complaints against them. Yet these two officers remain on the police force. Since when does protecting and serving mean beating unarmed women and terrifying innocent children?Watch the video from CBS Chicago below, via YouTube.

 The World Speaks Out On Trump — Top Foreign Diplomats Unite Against Him,"Here s the thing about being the leader of the free world, you need to be able to get along with other nations and be able to work with them hand in glove. However, the world seems to be united against he possibility of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. Several foreign diplomats have issued statements declaring their concern.According to Reuters: Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia have complained in recent private conversations, mostly about the xenophobic nature of Trump s statements, said three U.S. officials, who all declined to be identified. With one of the officials stating: As the [Trump] rhetoric has continued, and in some cases amped up, so, too, have concerns by certain leaders around the world. Reuters explains: U.S. officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign. U.S. allies in particular usually don t want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, mindful that they will have to work with whoever wins.Senior leaders in several countries   including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada   have already made public comments criticizing Trump s positions. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded him a threat to peace and prosperity in an interview published on Sunday. With Trump s consistent racist and xenophobic talk and tactics that are borderline fascist and totalitarian, it is easy to see why so many worldwide are deeply concerned. One senior NATO official said: European diplomats are constantly asking about Trump s rise with disbelief and, now, growing panic. With the EU facing an existential crisis, there s more than the usual anxiety about the U.S. turning inward when Europe needs U.S. support more than ever. Just last week,  more than 90 Republican foreign policy veterans have pledged to oppose Donald Trump, saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security, in the latest sign of fissures between the Republican presidential front-runner and the party establishment. It has been clear that not only Democrats don t want Trump, but also Republicans and pretty much the entire world. We, as voters, need to make sure that Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office, not even on a White House tour. He s dangerous and would not only tarnish the image of the United States at home and abroad, but may cause irreversible harm to diplomatic relations worldwide.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",News,"March 7, 2016",0,2566
"Turkey's border with northern Iraq remains open, for now, minister says","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s border with northern Iraq remains open, although that does not mean it will remain so, the Turkish customs minister said on Wednesday, adding the number of trucks passing through had decreased. Bulent Tufenkci also said he did not believe that the Kurdish independence referendum in northern Iraq would have a big impact on Turkish trade with Baghdad.   President Tayyip Erdogan has said Iraqi Kurds would go hungry if his country halts the flow of trucks and oil across the border, warning that Turkey could take military and economic measures against its neighbor after the referendum  The Habur border gate is open for now, we see that the numbers of vehicles passing are decreased,  Tufenkci said, referring to the main border crossing with northern Iraq.   The Habur border gate being open for now does not mean that it will remain open,  he said in comments broadcast live on television. Turkey, home to the region s largest Kurdish population, has been battling a three-decade insurgency in its largely Kurdish southeast and fears the referendum, held earlier this week, will inflame separatist tension at home.  We can continue trading with the Iraqi central government through Iran or via sea or airways,  Tufenkci said. Turkey has long been northern Iraq s main link to the outside world, with a Turkish oil pipeline connecting northern Iraq to global energy markets. Iraq, including the Kurdish region, was Turkey s third-largest export market in 2016, according to IMF data. Turkish exports to the country totaled $8.6 billion, behind Germany and the United Kingdom. ",worldnews,"September 27, 2017 ",1,1678

There s so much more to this whole thing and it s just getting worse for Bill and Hill. Chickens coming home to roost?Hillary Clinton s State Department was part of a panel that approved the sale of one of America s largest uranium mines at the same time a foundation controlled by the seller s chairman was making donations to a Clinton family charity, records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show.The $610 million sale of 51% of Uranium One to a unit of Rosatom, Russia s state nuclear agency, was approved in 2010 by a U.S. federal committee that assesses the security implications of foreign investments. The State Department, which Mrs. Clinton then ran, is one of its members.Between 2008 and 2012, the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, a project of the Clinton Foundation, received $2.35 million from the Fernwood Foundation, a family charity run by Ian Telfer, chairman of Uranium One before its sale, according to Canada Revenue Agency records.The donations were first reported in  Clinton Cash,  a new book by Peter Schweizer, an editor-at-large at a conservative news website, about the financial dealings of Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton.

Macron sees February end to fight against Islamic State in Syria,"PARIS (Reuters) - The military campaign against Islamic State in Syria should be completed in February following the end of fighting against the militant group in Iraq, French President Emmanuel Macron said.  On December 9, Iraqi Prime Minister (Haider al-) Abadi announced the end of the war and the victory over Daesh, and I think that by mid- to late February we will have won the war in Syria,  Macron said in a broadcast interview, using the Arab acronym for Islamic State. France would now push for peace talks involving all parties in the six-year-old Syrian conflict, including President Bashar al-Assad, Macron told France 2 televisions, promising  initiatives  early next year. He did not say how any French proposals would relate to existing negotiations being brokered by the United Nations. Despite being a leading backer of the Syrian opposition, France has sought a more pragmatic approach to the Syrian conflict since the arrival of President Emmanuel Macron, saying that the departure of al-Assad was not a pre-condition for talks.  Assad s government has been backed by Russia and Iran. President Vladimir Putin last week announced a significant scaling back of Russian forces in Syria, saying their mission was largely complete.

IF HILLARY HAS TO DROP OUT Of The Race…Here’s What Will Happen,"After months of speculation about Hillary s poor health, she appeared to have a pretty serious  episode  after leaving the 9-11 memorial service in NYC. Fortunately, someone was able to capture her on video in a  press-free zone,  as she appeared to be having convulsions and collapsing, forcing the secret service to physically lift her into her vehicle. Many in the media are saying the Democrat Party is scrambling to figure out what to do if Hillary is FORCED to drop out of the race. Of course Hillary wouldn t leave the race on her own for the good of the country or for the good of her party. This is her final shot at the highest office in our nation, and she has already proven there is nothing that will get in her way from her lifelong goal of becoming our first female President. No lie is too big and no scandal will take her down. It s her turn. But in the event that she ends up incapacitated by her illness which, according to many prominent physicians looks more like Parkinson s Disease, here s what would happen if she was forced to drop out:It s never happened before, but if Hillary Clinton has to drop out before Election Day, the Democratic National Committee would pick a successor   and it wouldn t have to be runningmate Tim Kaine.If Donald Trump faced the same situation, the Republican National Committee would select a GOP replacement, perhaps by reconvening 2,472 delegates.Clinton s near collapse over the weekend, coupled with the ages of the two major candidates, have brought the far-flung scenarios into the realm of possibility.There s 55 days until the election as of Tuesday and military and overseas ballots are mailed 45 days before the polls open.Thirty-seven states have some sort of early voting, with North Carolina being the first by mail on Sept. 9.What would really complicate matters is if a nominee had to drop out when ballots have already been cast. It would be an unprecedented, complicated mess,  one election lawyer said.The Electoral College would then select the next president.If the electors couldn t agree, the House of Representatives would make the selection.

Dutch government seeks to overturn court ruling on Srebrenica,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Dutch government has asked the country s supreme court to overturn a ruling that the Netherlands was partly responsible for the death of 300 Muslim men killed in the 1995 Srebrenica massacres. The victims were killed after being turned away from a Dutch-run United Nations base where thousands had sought refuge from attacking Bosnian Serb forces at the tail-end of the 1992-95 Bosnian war. Dutch peacekeepers, out-manned and out-gunned by the Bosnian Serbs, did little more than look on as the men were separated from women and deported to killing sites. Up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys in total were killed at Srebrenica in the first genocide in Europe since World War Two.  We do not share the judge s opinion that Dutch U.N. peacemakers acted unlawfully and we do not understand how the court reached that verdict,  Klaas Meijer, Defence Ministry spokesman, told Reuters on Wednesday. He was referring to an appeals court verdict in June confirming a 2014 ruling that said the Dutch peacekeepers should have known that the Muslim men would be murdered if they were forced to leave the U.N. base. The supreme court can only overturn an appeal ruling if it finds that the lower court erred in law or procedure.  Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has been convicted of genocide and sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. His chief military commander, General Ratko Mladic, is currently on trial at the U.N. Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague. A verdict in his case is expected in November.

 Neil deGrasse Tyson And J.K. Rowling BURN Trump With Searing Joke On Twitter (TWEETS),"There is no getting away from Donald Trump, and he can t get away from his impossibly offensive attitude toward women. He s a sexual predator that has no problem asking men on  The Apprentice  to rate women based on their physical attributes, and talked freely about their breast size and whether he d consider sleeping with them. That doesn t even touch his being proud of sexually assaulting women.Aside from that, this election cycle has brought out a certain type of antagonism and uncertainty about both candidates, particularly over their leadership styles and abilities. Neil deGrasse Tyson sort of spoke to that when he asked the following question:If a Space Alien landed in the USA & requested:  Take me to your leader , I wonder how Pres Trump would react vs Pres Clinton  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 14, 2016He probably didn t expect J.K. Rowling, the famous author of the Harry Potter series, to respond at all, let alone with the following burn:Afraid we need to know whether the alien has breasts before we can answer. https://t.co/xHE9K5F7xt  J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) October 14, 2016We don t care who you are, that s funny right there. Why? Because it s not only one of the biggest torches one can take to the catastrophe that is The Donald, but also because it keeps the fact that he s a danger to women and girls in the spotlight in a very mocking way.And, as we all know here, mocking King Cheeto is the only real way to deal with him on the internet.As another sign of how dangerous he is for women, he s busy calling all the women who ve accused him of sexual assault of being liars and seeking fame. He also asked one of his crowds why women aren t coming forward about President Obama, since obviously, if they ll lie for the sole purpose of smearing him, they should also be willing to lie to smear people he hates. In fact, they probably ought to be more willing, since he s absolutely amazing and everyone he hates is the scum of the Earth.Some others answered Tyson s question in a salty way, too:@neiltyson Grope them?

"Persecution of all Muslims in Myanmar on the rise, rights group says","BANGKOK (Reuters) - The systematic persecution of minority Muslims is on the rise across Myanmar and not confined to the northwestern state of Rakhine, where recent violence has sent nearly 90,000 Muslim Rohingya fleeing, a Myanmar rights group said on Tuesday. The independent Burma Human Rights Network said that persecution was backed by the government, elements among the country s Buddhist monks, and ultra-nationalist civilian groups.  The transition to democracy has allowed popular prejudices to influence how the new government rules, and has amplified a dangerous narrative that casts Muslims as an alien presence in Buddhist-majority Burma,  the group said in a report. The report draws on more than 350 interviews in more than 46 towns and villages over an eight-month period since March 2016. Myanmar s government made no immediate response to the report. Authorities deny discrimination and say security forces in Rakhine are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists . Besides Rohingya Muslims, the report also examines the wider picture of Muslims of different ethnicities across Myanmar following waves of communal violence in 2012 and 2013. The report says many Muslims of all ethnicities have been refused national identification cards, while access to Islamic places of worship has been blocked in some places. At least 21 villages around Myanmar have declared themselves  no-go zones  for Muslims, backed by the authorities, it said. In Rakhine state, the report highlighted growing segregation between Buddhists and Muslim communities and severe travel restriction for the Muslim Rohingyas, which limited their access to health care and education. Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled into neighboring Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive have killed at least 400 people. The treatment of Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing Myanmar de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who critics say have not done enough to protect the Muslim minority from persecution. The London-based Burma Human Rights Network has been advocating among the international community for human rights in Myanmar since 2012, it says on its website.

 This Cartoon CRUSHES Every Single Talking Point The NRA Can Possibly Spew Following Orlando," Americans have a right to defend themselves.   Banning one type of gun will lead to banning all guns.

Expanded background checks will lead to a registry, and then government tracking and privacy invasion.

Thanks to them, gun laws either get loosened, or they stay as they are. Then people like Omar Mateen, who was on the FBI s radar for potential ties to terrorist groups, can get whatever kinds of guns they want perfectly legally. There is no explaining that away.The NRA s hands are soaked in the fresh blood of the victims of the Orlando massacre, and what do they have to say about it? Nothing. Zero, zip, zilch, nada, just like after Sandy Hook. They re hiding like the sick cowards they are until they can get some cold-blooded fuckery together that makes them appear as white as snow in all of this.Florida has some of the loosest gun laws in the country.

Afghan Taliban say kidnapped U.S. professor is seriously ill,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban said on Monday that Kevin King, one of two professors from the American University of Afghanistan who were kidnapped in Kabul last year, is seriously ill and needs urgent medical attention.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said King, an American, was suffering from  dangerous  heart disease and kidney problems.  His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,  Mujahid said in a statement.   We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,  he said. The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages. King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital. Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.  The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.  Earlier this year, the Taliban released a video of King and Weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release Taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom. Kidnapping high profile targets has become a lucrative business for the Taliban and other militant groups in Afghanistan who in return often demand huge ransom or release of their members.

" Trump Continues Racist Birtherism, Won’t Say President Obama Is An American","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s first entrance to prominence in mainstream American politics was built on the same thing his entire horrific campaign has been built on: bigotry. Specifically, bigotry against America s first black president, Barack Obama. Trump led the racist charge that would come to be known as the  birther  movement, where he and his racist followers claimed that President Obama is not a Christian American who was born in Hawaii, but was instead a Muslim born in Kenya.Of course, these wild claims have been debunked over and over again during Obama s tenure as President, but that still has not convinced The Donald. In fact, to this day, Trump refuses to admit that he was wrong, and that indeed President Obama was born right here in the United States of America.

Well, Mr. Trump, you spent months upon months publicly worrying over the President s birth certificate, ginning up racism from your fellow bigots who couldn t stand that there s a Black family living in the White House, and no matter what President Obama did   including releasing his long form birth certificate as you requested   nothing was good enough for you.There s a reason for this. It s not about any sort of legitimate question regarding President Obama s origins, but about pure, unabashed racism.

" Officer Who Shot Tamir Rice Finally Fired, But NOT For Killing An Unarmed Child","After more than two years, the Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice has finally been fired. But the reason for his firing has sparked even more outrage.Timothy Loehmann, who was a rookie when he pullled the trigger on that fateful day in November 2014, was not fired for killing an unarmed child. Instead, he was given his walking papers because he lied on his application.Cleveland.com reports:  Loehmann was fired not for shooting Tamir, but for lying on his application with the Cleveland police department. He was also in his probationary period as a Cleveland officer giving the department more flexibility in letting him go, Cleveland Public Safety Director Michael McGrath said. The disciplinary letter cites a letter in Loehmann s personnel file from Independence that says he was emotionally immature and had  an inability to emotionally function.  The letter also cites an emotional breakdown Loehmann had on the gun range in Independence.Cleveland officials said in the letter that Loehmann was supposed to disclose that information. He was also supposed to say in his application that he failed a 2009 written exam when applying to work as an officer in Maple Heights. Loehmann never mentioned the Maple Heights test.A spokesperson for Tamir s relatives said that Loehmann s firing was  deeply disappointing  and only added insult to the pain and grief of the Rice family. Loehmann has been fired because he should never have been a police officer in the first place   but he should have been fired for shooting my son in less than one second, not just for lying on his application,  Tamir s mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement.On November 22, 2014, police got a report of a black male with a gun in a local park. The 911 dispatcher didn t bother to mention to police that the caller has said it was most likely a child and the gun was probably a fake. When Loehmann arrived with his partner, Frank Garmback, it took about three seconds for Loehmann to shoot and kill the 12-year-old, who was holding a toy gun.An Ohio grand jury decided not to incict either of the officers in December of 2015. Garmback was given a 10-day suspension because he pulled his cruiser too close to the child on the day of the shooting, which violated safety protocol. The 911 operator received an eight day suspension in March of this year for her role Rice s death.

House Democrats escalate effort to obtain Trump tax returns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats on Tuesday tried but failed to pressure Republicans into seeking President Donald Trump’s tax returns, saying the scandal over Michael Flynn made it imperative to find out whether the president has business ties to Russia. A day after the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee dismissed the idea, the panel’s Democrats proposed an amendment demanding that the committee ask the Treasury Department for copies of Trump’s returns by March 1. “Unless this amendment is adopted, we will never see the president’s tax returns while he’s in office,” Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, told committee Chairman Kevin Brady at a public hearing.  “Before you stonewall this, I urge you to think twice,” Levin added. “You’ll only keep the issue... alive. Brady strongly rejected the request as an abuse of the committee’s authority. Minutes later, committee rejected the amendment along party lines in a 23-15 vote. The vote represents only the latest skirmish between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over whether lawmakers should review Trump’s tax returns, which critics say would help determine whether the president’s sprawling business empire poses any conflicts of interest. House Democratic aides say the political battle will continue. The resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on Monday intensified Democratic interest in the documents, with one lawmaker warning about the potential danger of blackmail.   Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, issued the first request for Trump’s returns in a Feb. 1 letter that Brady rejected on Monday. Experts say federal law authorizes the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to examine individual tax returns. The two other panels are headed by Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who dismissed the idea of seeking Trump’s returns last week. House Republicans contend that the authority to examine tax returns was meant to ensure the proper administration of the tax code. Democrats contend that Trump’s business empire involves state-owned enterprises in China and the United Arab Emirates, as well as other interests in Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Taiwan and the Philippines.

"Britain's May, party leaders agree to tackle sexual harassment with new measures","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May and other party leaders agreed on Monday to introduce new safeguards for those working in parliament to try to contain a growing sexual harassment scandal. Britain s parliament is the latest institution to become embroiled in a sex scandal after abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior. Allegations have been made against lawmakers in several parties, but the growing scandal is particularly damaging for May who, weakened after losing her Conservatives  majority in June, cannot afford to lose any more parliamentary seats, especially when she is trying to negotiate a Brexit deal. May told reporters on Monday the agreement with Jeremy Corbyn, head of the main opposition Labour Party, and other leaders to introduce a new grievance procedure and face-to-face human resources support was an  important step forward .  The fact that they have taken place here at our seat of democracy should be a matter of shame for us all,  she said.  We ve taken an important step forward today. It s important we get this right and that is what I intend to do.  Corbyn said the leaders had agreed that any form of harassment or bullying was completely unacceptable  in this workplace or indeed in any other workplace in the country .  We ve agreed we will establish a group of representatives of the parties and of the staff ... in this building and we will work out necessary procedures,  he told Sky News. The scandal has led to one resignation - Michael Fallon quit as defense minister last week, but the number of allegations against lawmakers has increased almost daily.

Trump considering options for new Afghanistan strategy: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering his options for a new U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and will make an announcement “at the appropriate time,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Friday after Trump met with his national security team. U.S. officials told Reuters prior to the meeting at Camp David in Maryland that the options being presented to Trump range from a total pullout from Afghanistan, keeping the status quo of some 8,400 U.S. troops, a modest hike, or a small reduction that would focus on counter-terrorism.

 Paul Ryan Quotes Mel Gibson In A Desperate Attempt To Not Be The Next John Boehner,"Paul Ryan is learning quickly that John Boehner had good reason to cry all the time. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the leader of his or her party. The third most powerful person in the free world. Speakers enjoy visibility and influence above and beyond any other representative in the chamber.That s how it used to be, anyway, when the speaker was a position respected by their own party. From the days of Tip O Neil and Tom Foley to Dennis Hastert and even Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House commanded respect.Unfortunately for Republicans, their base began to die off and they needed to replenish, so they decided to go ahead and back the super-zealots of the Tea Party, who have now morphed into the  Freedom Caucus,  and things will never be the same. There have always been fringe-right congressmen and women. Michele Bachmann wasn t the first complete moron to deny science on the house floor, but she was one of the first to be counted among dozens who have actually come together to mold the Republican party platform into something even more conservative and stubborn than we re all used to.They pushed John Boehner right out of office and back to Ohio. They held the seat hostage until they found someone they could agree would do as much damage as possible. They grudgingly allowed Ryan to be elected, lest Nancy Pelosi steal the seat out from under the party, but promised that the honeymoon wouldn t last long.So far it s been easy for Ryan. Everything coming down the pike has been party-line and cut-and-dry. All of that will change when the budget process comes around again and the deal struck last year to pass the omnibus package has to stay glued together. The last thing Ryan and the Republicans want is for the Democrats to be able to point at them and laugh, yet again, because they couldn t be bothered to put aside their internal differences and govern. To quote William Wallace in Braveheart,  Paul Ryan said on Wednesday morning,  we have to unite the clans.  It was the single sound bite he released to the press before a meeting of congressional conservatives. Uniting the clans, as he is finding out, is going to take a lot more than condescending looks towards the President during State of the Union addresses.He was fresh out of a meeting just half a day earlier that the Huffington Post said  did not go well  with those Freedom Caucus members whose entire purpose in Washington is to return the United States to 1789 and force a do-over, with the several states ruling themselves and the Federal government being a non-existent figure-head good for dinners with world leaders and state funerals.Ryan probably expected a long run when he accepted the job as speaker. If he can t gain control of his own party, he may be looking for a new job sooner than later.Featured Image by Gage Skidmore ",News,"February 5, 2016",0,2932
 Alec Baldwin Just Tore Trump Apart Limb By Stupid Limb After Hellish Weekend Of Tyranny (TWEETS),"After this past week and few days that Trump has been our President*, we as Americans have no choice but to be fully aware of the horrors that are in store for us. Already, he has signed executive orders authorizing a partial Muslim ban that led to nationwide protests before it was ultimately shut down (temporarily) by a federal judge, removing funding from any international health organizations that so much as mention abortion, two major pipelines that will destroy our environment, his stupid fucking wall, and even concentration camps for the millions of undocumented immigrants he intends to round up.Already, the first President in history that was effectively installed by a hostile foreign dictator through an aggressive propaganda and fake news campaign as well as a series of hacks directly authorized and overseen by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is not only proving the naysayers correct, but showing the world that they have underestimated the level of horribleness he can attain. As always, Alec Baldwin rushed to the rescue Saturday night with exactly the words we need to hear:1- This country had a calling card.We all knew what it was.It wasn't Wall Street or Hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 20172- that brought countless people, America's future, to this country. It was freedom.Freedom was our calling card.Trump wants to kill that  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017 This country had a calling card. We all knew what it was. It wasn t Wall Street or Hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought America s future, to this country. It was freedom,  Baldwin wrote.  Freedom was our calling card. Trump wants to kill that. Baldwin came to the conclusion reached by many, including a growing number of those who voted for him:  Trump s gota go. 3- Trump's gotta go.  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017 All the indignation is fine. But we gotta get him out! We must demand a competency test!  Baldwin later added.  He is ill! Mentally ill! All the indignation is fine.But we gotta get him out!We must demand a competency test!He is ill!Mentally ill!  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017He s exactly right. Unfortunately most options are going to prove to be fruitless. Impeachment would require the rather enthusiastic participation of a Republican-controlled Congress. The 25th Amendment allows the Vice President and cabinet to declare him unfit for pretty much any reason, but that requires the people Trump appointed to turn on him and things are actually going pretty well for them right now as The Donald checks off the Neo-Nazi wish list items one by one. It would also require Republicans in general to be halfway decent people who care about the good of their country.Right now, things seem hopeless but something amazing is happening. Trump is bringing Americans together, causing even those who once were silent in the face of right-wing oppression to rise up and declare that they are not willing to take it anymore. Americans as a whole are facing this adversity head-on and, most importantly, together.Right now, our future is uncertain, but our number one duty to our country is to oppose Trump s hateful agenda at every turn. Our elected leaders   the ones with backbones, anyway   absolutely must obstruct Trump in any way possible. Our nation has never faced a test like Donald Trump, and it is imperative that we do not fail.Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 29, 2017",0,3594
 WATCH: Mika Brzezinski UNLOADS Fury Against Trump And His Buddies For Fat-Shaming Women,"The men of Morning Joe found Donald Trump s insults against women funny, but Mika Brzezinski shut them and their disgusting sexism down HARD.Joe Scarborough and Willy Geist had a laugh over Trump s interview with Bill O Reilly on Wednesday night and seemed to have no problem with him fat-shaming women just because they gain a little weight.Scarborough tried to excuse Trump s behavior as  just trying to help  while Geist called Trump the real  hero of this story. A sickened Mika then jumped in and took Trump to the woodshed on behalf of women everywhere. It s a beauty contest. You can t actually have any weight on your body for a beauty contest because that wouldn t be beautiful. Think about that. Geist then cracked that women shouldn t  put on 60 pounds  and attributed the  joke  to Newt Gingrich, a supporter of Trump and his campaign. Really?  Mika asked.  That s the pot! People like Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich and men can walk around just rotund as all get out,  Mika continued. And it s not an issue. But women, in order to be beautiful, you have to be 117 pounds. I m sorry. Can someone tell me what year we re in here? Is it 2016? I think we re back in the 70s with these hideous pageants   which, by the way we need to talk about at some point. Someone who runs beauty pageants   you have to think about how they think about women.Look at those beauty pageants. Look at them! Young women walking around in bikinis getting graded on how they look. I can t believe we still do these things.Do we want someone who ran beauty pageants? And still thinks it s okay to talk about gaining weight being a problem? Do we really want that person in the White House? Hiring women? I don t think he s going to hire women unless they re tens. In his view, which is 117 pounds and starving and covered in plastic. Indeed, these sexists think it s okay for them to gain weight but they think women should be held to certain standards. And that s why Trump is getting his ass handed to him by women right now in the polls.Joe Scarborough repeatedly tried to interrupt Mika and talk over her throughout her rant, which is something he probably took a lot of flack about later after the show.In the end, however, Mika got the last word and made it clear that Trump s treatment of women is not something to joke about. It s disgusting. It s perverted. It s a serious story. Stupid men. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump s sexism should automatically disqualify him from seeking the presidency. Instead, Republican chose him as their leader and that demonstrated just how little they care about women, and if every woman in this country voted against Trump and the GOP every year, the party would go extinct.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"September 29, 2016",0,2832
U.S. appeals court hears arguments on Trump travel ban,"SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday wrestled with a bid by President Donald Trump to show that his latest travel ban targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries is legal. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing in Seattle came two days after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Trump’s travel ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds.  The ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. The Republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trump’s powers under immigration law. Trump’s ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. The same three judge 9th Circuit panel which limited a previous version of Trump’s ban heard arguments on Wednesday. Some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the president’s policy. Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked Hawaii’s lawyers whether Trump’s latest proclamation is more sound than prior versions. The current one, he said, is based on specific findings that some foreign governments do not share enough information to properly vet immigrants.  “You would trust Kim Jong Un to say this person is this person, you gotta let him in?” Hawkins said. Judge Ronald Gould said the court would issue a ruling “as soon as practicable.” Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests.  He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts.  That expired in September after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version.  The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear a separate challenge to the ban on Friday, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.

OVER 100 COLLEGES WILL HOLD SEPARATE GRADUATION Ceremonies For Gays As Part Of A “Cultural Celebration”,"A Bi-Product Of Obama s Divided America The LGBT community has been fighting a decades-long culture war to be included in the fabrics of American society   and it s winning.Yet when it comes to their graduation ceremonies, it seems they d prefer exclusivity.More than 100 colleges and universities this spring will be holding separate graduation ceremonies for the LGBTQ population and their allies, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). This includes Georgetown University, Duke University, Harvard University and Boston College, among others.The graduation ceremony is called the  Lavender Graduation,  signifying  pink triange that gay men were forced to wear in concentration camps and the black triange designating lesbians as political prisoners in Nazi Germany,  according to HRC.The special ceremony was started in 1995 at the University of Michigan by Dr. Ronni Sanlo, a Jewish lesbian, who said she was denied attendance at her children s graduation because of her sexual orientation. These events provide a sense of community for minority students who often experience tremendous culture shock at their impersonalized institutions,  HRC says on its website, explaining the need for such ceremonies.  For many students they are the payoff for staying in school, and friends and families find the smaller, more ethnic ceremonies both meaningful and personal. They deem it a  cultural celebration,  that  recognizes LGBT students of all races and ethnicities  it acknowledges their achievements and contributions to the university as students who  survived the college experience.

Republican Trump releases healthcare proposals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled proposals for reforming U.S. healthcare that included repealing Obamacare, allowing prescription drugs to be imported, and turning the Medicaid program for the poor into block grants to states. The plan also calls for the sale of health insurance plans across state lines, full deduction of health insurance premiums from income tax and adds: ""We must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance.""  (here) Trump, who is the front-runner in the race to become the Republican nominee in November’s presidential election, is also proposing allowing individuals to use Health Savings Accounts (HAS) to pay for out-of-pocket expenses. Contributions to HSAs would be tax-free and could be passed on to heirs without any tax penalty. The proposals include requiring “...price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations like clinics and hospitals. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures, exams or any other medical-related procedure.”          On drug prices, Trump departs from standard Republican policy by calling for lowering barriers to cheaper imported pharmaceuticals. “Allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers,” the statement says, adding that “Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America.” The proposals also call for reforming mental health programs and institutions, but provides few details about how to do this. Trump also called for tighter enforcement of immigration laws, a key plank in his campaign platform, as a way to bring down healthcare costs. “Providing healthcare to illegal immigrants costs us some $11 billion annually. If we were to simply enforce the current immigration laws and restrict the unbridled granting of visas to this country, we could relieve healthcare cost pressures on state and local governments,” the proposal statement says.     Democrats were quick to criticize the plan. “As Democrats have said all along, Donald Trump is not an outsider engaging in a hostile takeover of the GOP – in fact, he embodies the Republican Party. “The fact that his healthcare ‘plan’ is clearly cribbed from worn-out and false GOP talking points proves that Trump is just another Republican politician who wants to take healthcare away from millions of Americans without offering any substantive alternative,” Democratic National Committee Communications Director Luis Miranda said in a statement.

Myanmar military trucks hit landmines in troubled Rakhine; one injured,"YANGON (Reuters) - One person was injured when military trucks hit landmines in Myanmar s troubled Rakhine State this week, state media said on Friday, amid ethnic tension following an army crackdown that sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing. More than 600,000 of the refugees have entered neighboring Bangladesh since Aug. 25 attacks by Rohingya militants sparked the army operation. Killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since then amount to ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, the United Nations says. Three landmine blasts caused extensive damage to three military trucks in Rakhine s central Minbya township on Wednesday morning, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said. The landmines were  apparently targeting  army convoys, it added.  Later that day, another landmine exploded near the village of Vethali in central Rakhine as seven military trucks passed, injuring one pedestrian but causing no damage to the vehicles, the paper said.  It was not clear who was responsible for the attacks. Several landmine explosions were reported near the area this year.  United Nations staff and aid workers have said they fear violence in northern Rakhine could spread to new areas as  Buddhist villagers in more peaceful areas enforce a system of local apartheid that punishes people trading with minority Muslims. Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar see Rohingya Muslims as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although many of the Rohingya can trace family for generations. After the August attacks on police posts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which the government has declared a terrorist organization, security forces unleashed a brutal counteroffensive in Muslim-majority northern Rakhine. Even though Myanmar says military operations ceased on Sept. 5, hundreds of refugees have continued to cross the Naf river separating Rakhine and Bangladesh in recent weeks. Separately, Myanmar security forces have arrested 19 men suspected of involvement in the August attacks and charged them under the anti-terrorism law, the newspaper said on Friday.

"Scottish independence case helped by ""Brexit chaos"": Sturgeon","EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain s struggles to chart a way out of the European Union are boosting the case for Scottish independence, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday, but she shied away from committing to a date for another referendum vote. Scotland rejected independence by a 10 percentage point margin in a 2014 vote, and polls indicate that support for it has not shifted significantly since then.  We will consider the (independence referendum) timing again when we have more clarity on what we face,  Sturgeon said, speaking as her Scottish National Party (SNP) began a three-day conference in Glasgow.   People watch the chaos that is engulfing the UK right now and people look ahead and see the damage that is likely to be done by this unfolding disaster that is not just Brexit but this incompetent and chaotic approach to Brexit being presided over by (Conservative Prime Minister) Theresa May,  she told the BBC.  I think the case for Scotland s future in Scotland s hands (...) is becoming greater and stronger by the day.  Sturgeon, who heads the devolved Scottish government, saw her party lose more than one third of its seats in Britain s June election after it mistimed a push for another vote on secession. It subsequently put the plan on hold. Brexit has put the union of the UK s four nations under strain because Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain  while Wales and the larger England voted to leave. Britain s main parties are fighting over what new relationship is needed with the bloc after 40 years of shared trade and politics. May has seen her authority over the Conservatives erode since a June s snap election in which she lost her parliamentary majority. That means Britain still has a choice over the shape of its future trading relations, Sturgeon argued.  I believe so, so strongly, not for ideological reasons but for hard practical reasons, it would be an act of monumental folly for the UK to come out of the single market.

 Trump’s DC Hotel Raised Price And Made Millions In Months Off His Presidency,"Donald Trump s conflicts of interest were of massive concern for many Americans, and rightfully so. There is absolutely no doubt that Trump has been trying to profit off of his presidency   and now there s proof.This year, Trump s company turned $1.97 million in profit at Trump International Hotel, which is far higher than expectations. The Trump Organization actually predicted it would lose $2.1 million in the first four months of Trump s presidency, but the business is instead boasting a 192 percent improvement over what the Trump family projected when the hotel was opened in the fall.At the center of these profits are members of Trump s own Cabinet, who have either stayed or lived at the hotel. The hotel is also frequently visited by Trump s inner circle and Republican leaders, who are willing to spend big money and food and beverages at the hotel s bar and restaurant. Currently, the hotel is charging guests an average of $652.98 a night, which is 57 percent higher than the company s expectations. This makes the hotel the most expensive in the city   many others such as Four Seasons and Willard are only charging $495 per night.It s no wonder that several ethics experts and Democrats have objected to this arrangement. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) called the government s lease a  highly unethical arrangement.  He said: What makes all of this particularly galling is that we now have the unprecedented situation where the President of the United States is both the landlord and tenant of a federal building. Trump has made absolutely no effort to address ethical concerns about his businesses, even though he had originally promised to do so when he won the election.Trump continues to be involved in his businesses and continues to profit off of them. Already, he has been sued by government watchdog groups and state attorneys general over these business practices. However, his behavior clearly shows that he doesn t care. Trump has only been in office for a few months, and he s already spent 65 days at his properties and continues to host dinners that look more like promotions than anything else.

"As U.S. ban on travel to North Korea kicks in, tourists say their farewells"," (This Aug 31 story corrects location of Burkhead s home in third paragraph.) By Christian Shepherd BEIJING (Reuters) - American tourist Nicholas Burkhead said he d be happy to return to his latest holiday destination, with its beautiful scenery, great food and friendly people. The problem is, the destination was North Korea and a U.S. State Department ban on travel to the isolated country takes effect on Friday. Burkhead, a 35-year-old resident of Virginia, was among the last American tourists to leave North Korea, landing on Thursday in Beijing.  I was surprised at how friendly everyone was,  Burkhead said after stepping off the last scheduled flight to Beijing from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, before the U.S. travel ban kicks in.  It was very relaxing - beautiful scenery and they fed us very well in the restaurants there, but the exchange rate wasn t too good for the local won,  he told a waiting scrum of reporters. Burkhead arrived in Beijing on North Korea s state-owned Air Koryo after visiting Pyongyang as well as the city of Kaesong near the heavily armed border with South Korea. His five-day tour cost 1,850 euros ($2,200). Other Americans on the flight included two aid workers as well as Jamie Banfill, 32, who had led tours to North Korea but was visiting this time as a tourist. Banfill, who had made the trip to say goodbyes after regularly traveling to the North for a decade, said the travel ban short-sighted.  It s an extremely complex situation on the Korean peninsula and they oversimplified it,  he said. The United States last month announced a ban on U.S. passport holders from traveling to North Korea, effective Sept. 1. Journalists and humanitarian workers are allowed to apply for exemptions under the ban, which is similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya. Heidi Linton, director of Christian Friends of Korea, who has been working in North Korea for more than 20 years, told reporters she worried about the people her aid group helped, if her exemption was not granted soon.  We started a hepatitis B program and we have 705 patients that have been started on life-saving medicine, that if they go off that medicine then their lives are in danger,  she said.    It was not immediately clear how many Americans had sought, or been granted, exemptions or how many were still in North Korea. An official at the state department said it was not able to give an estimate on the number of U.S. citizens there. North Korea is under growing international pressure over its nuclear tests and repeated ballistic missile launches, including one this week that flew over northern Japan. The U.S. ban on travel to North Korea followed the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed during a tour last year. Warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda sign, was returned to the United States in a coma in June and died six days later. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. Warmbier had been detained leaving the airport in Pyongyang.    I was expecting a strict security check on exit but there was nothing like that,  Burkhead said. The State Department declared U.S. passports invalid for travel to, in or through North Korea. The restriction applies for one year unless extended or revoked by the secretary of state. North Korean state media has described the ban as a  sordid  attempt to limit human exchanges. North Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, as well as three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work.  This month, North Korea released a Canadian pastor who had been imprisoned there for more than two years. Hundreds of Americans are among the 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea annually, according to U.S. lawmaker Joe Wilson. ",worldnews,"August 31, 2017 ",1,3962

 New Report Says Trump Destroyed Scaramucci’s Marriage,"Donald Trump s new pick for Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, is apparently so enamored with Trump that it s come between him and his wife, at least according to the New York Post s Page Six.Scaramucci s wife, Deidre Ball, was a Vice President in investor relations for Scaramucci s former company, SkyBridge Capital. According to Page Six, Ball is filing for divorce because of Scaramucci s ambition and his desire to get close to Trump, who she can t stand. They have been married for three years and have two children together.One source told Page Six,  Deidre has left him and has filed for divorce. She liked the nice Wall Street life and their home on Long Island, not the insane world of D.C. She is tired of his naked ambition, which is so enormous that it left her at her wits  end. She has left him even though they have two children together. A second source close to Scaramucci   who has alternately not been wearing his wedding ring, or has been sporting it on his right hand   said the former couple had fought over his loyalty to Trump. This was his second marriage and Ball was noticeably not present at his recent SALT conference in mid-May.The New York Post is traditionally one of the few media outlets that refuses to report on everything negative about the Trump administration and ,maybe the reason this story made the papers is that it s all about Scaramucci s swooning love affair with Trump. The Mooch,  as Scaramucci refers to himself, admires Trump s alleged athletic abilities: I ve seen this guy throw a dead spiral through a tire. I ve seen him at Madison Square Garden with a topcoat on. He s standing in the key and he s hitting foul shots and swishing them, OK? He sinks 3-foot putts. Source: NewsweekIn fact, during his initial press briefing, the Mooch used the word  love  21 times, and most of them were about Trump. I love the President, and I m very, very loyal to the President. And I love the mission that the President has, okay? Since the early days of the campaign when I went to these rallies and I saw the love that the people had for the President, and I grew up in the middle class, and so there s a struggle out there. The President saw that before I did. I wish I could tell you I saw it before him, but he taught it to me. And I feel that struggle and have empathy for that struggle, and I want to be here to help him make things better for the American people.What do you want to bet that his wife doesn t receive the same sort of adulation. Brava to Ball, though, for standing up for her principles and for her perfectly normal hatred of Donald Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"July 28, 2017",0,2718

 Rudy Giuliani’s Daughter Announces She’s Backing Hillary Clinton,"Trump s biggest (and most insane) surrogate Rudy Giuliani just got some bad news   his daughter, Caroline, is backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for President over Donald Trump, her father s new BFF.After posting on her Facebook that she has been  pro Hillary all along,  and making her profile picture Clinton s iconic H, Giuliani confirmed that the account was indeed hers and that her father, Rudy, does know:I love Hillary, I think she s by far the most qualified candidate that we ve had in a long while.

U.S. agency to free up protest sites during Trump inauguration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Protesters will get public sites for demonstrations during Republican Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, a major federal land agency said on Thursday, after being threatened with a lawsuit from civil rights lawyers who accused it of quashing dissent. Up to 900,000 people are expected to pack into the U.S.  capital for the New York businessman’s Jan. 20 swearing-in to his first political office. Some plan to protest Trump’s more controversial promises, including plans to build a wall along the Mexican border and deport illegal immigrants. Only three of the more than 30 groups seeking to stage rallies either protesting or celebrating Trump’s election independently of the Trump Presidential Inaugural Committee have received permits to use National Park Service land before, during or after Trump’s inauguration. The agency said it expected to begin issuing permits for demonstration sites on park land in coming days, an announcement that came a few hours after the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund said it would sue if the permits were not issued by Friday. “We believe that this is a significant victory for free speech. They are doing this under threat of litigation,” Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, the fund’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. The Park Service had maintained it was following a procedure in place since 2008 by turning over control of sites, including along the parade route from the Capitol to the White House, to Trump’s Presidential Inaugural Committee. Agency spokesman Mike Litterst said the Park Service would regain control of permits for the Ellipse, a grassy area south of the White House, from the inaugural committee on Jan. 21. Litterst said in an email that the agency was working with more than 30 permit applicants and was still receiving requests.    The Park Service has been under a court order since 2008 mandating it to guarantee free speech during presidential inaugurations. Three liberal groups, the ANSWER Coalition, the American Constitution Society and the Black is Back Coalition, have been permitted to hold events near the parade route, but only ANSWER was granted one for Inauguration Day, according to the Park Service permits website. Some 3,000 police officers and 7,000 National Guard troops from outside the District will be on hand to help provide security at Trump’s swearing in, Chris Geldart, the District of Columbia’s homeland security director said in a phone interview. The biggest inauguration protest, the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, will go on regardless of the dispute over protest sites since it will be held on city streets. At least one protest could come with a cloud of marijuana smoke, as the DCMJ pro-pot lobbying group, which spearheaded the legalization of the drug in Washington D.C. in 2015, plans to distribute 4,200 joints near the inaugural site. Smoking marijuana along the parade route would violate the laws of both the District of Columbia - which allows it only in private spaces - and the federal government, which bans it outright.

"Sanders wins Wyoming, prepares to take on Clinton in New York","WASHINGTON - Bernie Sanders won the U.S. presidential Democratic nominating contest in Wyoming on Saturday, besting rival Hillary Clinton and adding to a string of recent victories as the two candidates gear up for a crucial matchup in New York. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has won seven out of the last eight state-level Democratic nominating contests, trying to chip away at Clinton’s big lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the party’s nomination. Wyoming’s 14 Democratic delegates - fewer than any other state - are awarded proportionally based on support from individuals participating in the nominating contest.  Early estimates showed that while Sanders won the contest, both he and Clinton would likely receive seven delegates each in the close race, maintaining Clinton’s lead overall. Going into Wyoming, Clinton had more than half of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination. Sanders trailed her by 250 pledged delegates, those awarded based on the results of the state nominating contests.   Clinton’s lead widens when superdelegates, Democratic leaders who can decide whom to support at the party’s July convention, are included in the tallies. Clinton and Sanders both spent Saturday campaigning in New York, which holds its contest on April 19 and where a total of 291 delegates are up for grabs, more than 10 percent of the tally needed to win the party’s nomination. Sanders’ wife, Jane Sanders, went onstage where he was speaking at a community college in Queens, a borough of New York City, to alert him to Saturday’s victory. “News bulletin - we just won Wyoming!” Sanders said to cheers. Speaking to reporters after the event, Sanders said he believed he had enough momentum to secure the nomination. “We are closing very fast,” Sanders said.   Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, campaigned in the nearby borough of Brooklyn, where her campaign is based. Clinton represented New York as a U.S. senator and considers the state her home turf. Recent polls have shown Clinton more than 10 points ahead in the state. Tension between the two candidates flared earlier this week in a party race that has typically focused on policies and not personal attacks. The candidates dialed back their criticism of one another on Friday. In Wyoming’s Republican contest last month, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas beat New York billionaire Donald Trump, the party’s front-runner. Cruz is trying to block Trump from receiving enough delegates to win the nomination outright, which would lead to a contested convention in July. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that a third of Trump’s Republican supporters could consider abandoning the party’s candidate if Trump is denied the nomination at a contested convention.

Scotland's SNP must come up with 'doable' independence plan after Brexit: Salmond,"GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Scotland s former first minister believes the independence movement has a three-year window after Britain quits the European Union to push again for seccession, despite the Scottish National Party s losses in an election in June. Salmond, who is still very influential in the movement, said the independence drive could be refreshed by proposing to join the European Free Trade Association, which would give Scotland European single market membership.  The SNP lost a third of its seats in the national election, including Salmond s own seat, in a sign of waning enthusiasm for another Scottish independence referendum after the uncertainties thrown up by Brexit. Despite that, support for independence itself has remained at the 45 percent level it was when it was voted down in 2014 and the SNP still holds 35 of Scotland s 59 seats in the Westminster parliament.  Salmond said Brexit was proving to be disastrous for Britain and would only end in  humiliation . Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership while Wales and most-populous England voted to leave at last year s referendum, straining the ties of the four-nation United Kingdom.   So the SNP were and are right about Brexit, but as we found out to our cost in the election just being right does not necessarily make for popularity. Nor does it absolve us of a responsibility to attempt to create order out of chaos,  he told a Business for Scotland annual dinner.   We have 18 months of Brexit negotiations and after that perhaps a three-year period of transition to get our ducks in a row. Salmond said, in a speech peppered with jibes at the government s Brexit talks, which have faltered in recent weeks. He said that EFTA membership could be a prelude to full EU membership if necessary.   We have to offer something which is doable, feasible and speedily deliverable for the European connections of an independent Scotland,  he said, ",worldnews,"September 8, 2017 ",1,2028
McCain introduces bill to kill Puerto Rico shipping restrictions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators John McCain and Mike Lee introduced a bill on Thursday to permanently waive shipping restrictions on Puerto Rico, saying a temporary waiver from the Trump administration is “insufficient” to help the island rebuild from Hurricane Maria. President Donald Trump’s administration earlier on Thursday waived the restriction known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or the Jones Act, for Puerto Rico for 10 days, after a request by Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rossello. Opponents of the Jones Act, which bars foreign vessels from shipping goods between U.S. coasts, say it hurts consumers on U.S. islands, including Puerto Rico and Hawaii, by adding shipping costs to imports of basic goods like food and fuel.  McCain called the Jones Act an “antiquated, protectionist law that has driven up costs and crippled Puerto Rico’s economy.”  In 2013, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report said the Jones Act hurts Puerto Rico’s economy. It estimated that shipping costs from the U.S. East Coast to Puerto Rico are double what they are to the nearby Dominican Republic, thanks mainly to the Jones Act.   In addition, the U.S. Virgin Islands have been exempt from the Jones Act for decades, which opponents of the law say is unfair to Puerto Rico.  It was unclear whether McCain could gain widespread support for the bill that would waive the law, which is supported by shipping and security interests.   Not only do U.S. ship builders support the Jones Act, but also a wide array of industries that build parts that go into ships, businesses that are spread throughout the country.  President Donald Trump, before his administration waived the law temporarily, pointed out that “a lot of shippers and ... a lot of people that work in the shipping industry” did not want the restrictions waived for Puerto Rico. In 1998, McCain sponsored legislation to allow waivers of the law, a measure that created exemptions that are in place today. In 2010, 2015 and this past July he introduced legislation to fully repeal the restrictions.  ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2017 ",1,2136
UK's Johnson to visit Moscow this year to discuss security,"LONDON (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson will travel to Moscow later this year to discuss international security issues, the British government said on Friday. Johnson canceled what would have been the first visit to Russia in five years by a British foreign secretary in April due to a poison gas attack in a rebel-held area of Syria that prompted the United States to carry out missile strikes. Moscow backs Syrian government forces against rebels in the country s civil war. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov subsequently met Johnson at the United Nations in September.   Our relationship with Russia is not straightforward,  Johnson said in a statement.  That is all the more reason to be talking to Russia - to manage our differences and cooperate where possible for the security of both our nations and the international community.  Relations between Britain and Russia have been strained since the murder of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, a killing which a British inquiry said was probably approved by President Vladimir Putin. Britain s foreign ministry said Johnson, on his Moscow visit, wished to discuss North Korea, Iran and regional stability in the Middle East, as well as security for the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament in Russia.  We will continue to challenge Russia s approach where we disagree, whether that is Russia s actions in Syria or its aggression toward Ukraine. My visit will provide an opportunity to talk about these issues and more, face-to-face,  Johnson said. ",worldnews,"October 13, 2017 ",1,1598

Three dead bodies pulled from sea near Spain after migrant boat sinks,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish rescue services pulled three drowned men from the Strait of Gibraltar after rescuing one man from a half-sunken, rickety boat and another from the open sea, an emergency services spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The men are believed to be from a boat that was carrying migrants attempting to cross into Europe, the spokeswoman said. One of the rescued men said there were six people aboard originally, she said. The search continues for the sixth person. Conditions in the Strait of Gibraltar - a narrow strip of water that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea - are currently dangerous with bad weather and big waves, she said.  Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the treacherous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea from Africa every year in unseaworthy boats, leading to thousands of deaths by drowning. Migrant drownings have topped 3,000 on Mediterranean Sea routes for the fourth straight year, the International Organization for Migration said on Tuesday. Migrants seeking a better life in Europe have sought new routes through Spain in an effort to get around European Union actions to curb migration in the central and eastern Mediterranean. Almost 10,300 people arrived in Spain by sea in the first seven months of 2017, the IOM said in September, four times as many as in 2016. ",worldnews,"November 29, 2017 ",1,1399

Embattled Pennsylvania attorney general survives Senate removal vote,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican state senators in Pennsylvania failed to muster enough votes on Wednesday to oust Attorney General Kathleen Kane, who is facing criminal charges for allegedly leaking secret grand jury material. All but one of the Senate’s 30 Republicans voted to remove Kane, a Democrat, from office because her law license has been suspended, falling four votes short of the two-thirds majority required. The chamber’s 18 Democrats, as well as one Republican, opposed the move. “It is simply not appropriate to take this action,” said Senator Judy Schwank, a Democrat who served on the committee that examined Kane’s removal. “It is an outrage against voters’ right to choose their elected officials.” Kane has been in legal hot water ever since her indictment last summer for allegedly passing grand jury information to a reporter as part of a personal feud. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court suspended her law license last fall. Wednesday’s debate in the Senate focused on whether Kane could continue to function as attorney general without a license to practice law. Unlike impeachment, which targets officeholders who have committed crimes and requires action by both legislative chambers, removal is aimed at incompetent but law-abiding officials and requires only Senate action. The process had not been used since 1891. “When you have a suspended law license, you cannot do anything!” said Senator John Gordner, the Republican who chaired the removal committee, during Wednesday’s three-hour debate. But others, notably Democratic former Governor Edward Rendell, who served eight years as district attorney of Philadelphia, previously testified at hearings that a license was not essential. Rendell said that in a large district attorney office, the job is mainly about making managerial decisions, not practicing law. Kane has claimed her indictment was brought in response to her efforts to release thousands of explicit or offensive e-mails circulated by former prosecutors in her office, including those who prosecuted Penn State sexual predator Jerry Sandusky, and two members of the state Supreme Court, among others. “Today is a good day for all those who share my desire to restore confidence in our judges and prosecutors and integrity to our system of justice,” Kane said in a statement after the vote. She could still face removal efforts. The state House of Representatives voted separately on Wednesday to begin an impeachment inquiry, while Senate Republicans used a procedural maneuver that allows them to call for another removal vote if circumstances change.

U.S. Treasury nominee Mnuchin hammered over offshore tax havens,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he would work to eliminate the need for offshore tax havens, as Democratic senators accused the Wall Street veteran of using such vehicles to shelter hedge fund money from the government.  In a confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Treasury was attacked for failing to promptly disclose he was a director of an offshore business vehicle domiciled in the Cayman Islands and owned more than $100 million in real estate. Offshore tax havens used to shield income have become a symbol of the growing divide between rich and average Americans. Democrats seized on the disclosures, made late on Wednesday, to question Mnuchin’s qualifications to revamp the tax code.    “One does not go and create offshore entities at the end of the day other than to avoid, in some form or fashion, the tax laws of the United States. That’s pretty simple,” New Jersey Democratic Senator Robert Menendez said. “We have to decide whether that’s necessarily the essence of what we want as leadership,” Menendez said. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, hedge fund manager and Hollywood film financier, said he moved his Dune Capital Partners LLC registry to the Caymans to allow for some pension fund clients to invest in his funds, not to avoid taxes. But Mnuchin, 54, added that it “makes no sense” for the U.S. tax code to encourage the use of such entities. “In the hedge fund world these are only set up to make the accountants rich and I would love to work with the IRS to close these tax issues that make no sense.” Among the incoming Trump administration’s top economic priorities is a massive tax reform effort aimed at lowering rates for businesses and individuals and closing many deductions and credits. Mnuchin, who insisted his last-minute disclosures were not intentional but due to the complexity of his holdings, complicated federal forms and a lawyer’s advice that the real estate disclosure was not required, also tried to clarify Trump’s recent market-moving comments on the U.S. dollar. The Republican businessman-turned politician, who will be sworn in on Friday, said in an interview published this week in the Wall Street Journal that the dollar’s strength was “killing us,” prompting the greenback to fall and gold prices to jump. Mnuchin said he believed that Trump’s remarks, which usurped a role normally reserved for Treasury secretaries, referred to a short-term spike in the dollar due to market factors, not its longer-term value. “The long-term strength over long periods of time is important” for the dollar, Mnuchin said.      He also said he would like to see an increase in the U.S. government’s debt ceiling “sooner rather than later” to avoid another standoff with Congress that could upset financial markets. The current debt ceiling extension expires on March 15, but the Treasury would not likely exhaust its borrowing capacity for several more months after that.  Democrats had gone into Mnuchin’s hearing perceiving him as one of the more vulnerable Trump nominees, partly due to his involvement with OneWest Bank, which he ran in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. They hammered him for the 36,000 foreclosures that the bank pursued after Mnuchin struck a lucrative deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp to absorb most of the losses from such actions. Critics have described OneWest as a ‘foreclosure machine’ and Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s top Democrat, criticized the bank’s automated “robo-signing” of foreclosure documents and foreclosing on the widows of reverse mortgage holders. Mnuchin argued that his bank was a “loan modification machine,” offering payment reductions to 101,000 borrowers to try to keep them in their homes, and said his turnaround of the failed IndyMac bank, which became OneWest, saved thousands of jobs and homes.

WHY CHRISTIANS ARE ASKING THEIR FELLOW CHRISTIANS TO WEAR ORANGE TO CHURCH #orangejumpsuit,"It s about time Rev. Patrick Mahoney, of Church on the Hill in Washington, D.C. says that Christians in America cannot afford to be silent about what s going on.Speaking with Fox News on Friday, he discussed the persecution of Christians worldwide. Every five minutes, a Christian dies for their faith around the world. That s over 100,000  a year, he said.Mahoney started the #orangejumpsuit project to raise awareness, encouraging supporters to wear orange in a show of support for Christians being murdered for their faith. The color represents the jumpsuits worn by captives of ISIS, including the 20 Egyptian Copts beheaded in Libya in February.As Christians around the country embrace the campaign by wearing orange to church, Mahoney argued that it is not a strictly Christian movement. Americans need to realize we are seeing a genocide the likes we have not seen in a generation,  he said.And for women, forced into marriages and sold into sex trafficking operations, he said, it is  especially horrifying.

Ending Iran nuclear deal would worsen North Korea situation: Kerry,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump risks driving Iran towards nuclear proliferation and worsening a standoff with North Korea if Washington ends a nuclear deal with Tehran, former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said late on Thursday. Kerry, who negotiated the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, was speaking a week after Trump refused to certify that Tehran was in compliance with it, amid growing tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. “If you want to negotiate with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution, the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the United Nations,” Kerry said. He was speaking in a private lecture delivered at Geneva’s Graduate Institute. “And secondly, screw around with the deal that has already been made because the message is, don’t make a deal with the United States, they won’t keep their word,” he said. The nuclear deal places Iran under tough restraints, including inspections, round-the-clock surveillance and tracking every ounce of uranium produced, Kerry said. “We would notice an uptick in their enrichment, like that,” he said, snapping his fingers. “And nobody that I know of with common sense can understand what the virtue is in accelerating a confrontation with the possibility that they might decide they want to break out and make it (a nuclear bomb) now instead of 10 or 15 or 25 years from now.” Kerry, a former Senator who headed the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Swiss media that Trump’s leaving the Iranian deal’s fate to Congress was “very dangerous” and opened the door to “party politics”. Congress cannot unilaterally renegotiate a multilateral accord, the Geneva daily Le Temps quoted him as saying. “It is possible that Congress would make an unreasonable decision that would put Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a very complicated political situation that could force him to retaliate. It’s a slippery slope.”  Khamenei said on Wednesday that Tehran would stick to its accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported. If Iran violated the accord, U.N. sanctions would snap back into place, Kerry told the audience. “Moreover, at that point in time folks, we have a year of break-up. We have all the time that we need in the world to be able to bomb their facilities into submission.” Ending the deal could lead to Iran hiding fissile production facilities “deep in a mountain where we have no insight”. “So the scenario that Trump opens up by saying ‘let’s get rid of the deal’ is actually proliferation, far more damaging and dangerous,” Kerry said.

LAUGHABLE: Clinton Press Secretary Gives Conditions Under Which She Will Give A Press Conference,"From the ABC News report:Hillary Clinton  Will Hold Press Conferences  as President, Press Secretary VowsIt s been 272 days since Hillary Clinton s last press conference. But Clinton s lead press secretary, Brian Fallon, vowed that if elected,  Hillary Clinton will hold press conferences. But the frequency of them is something that would just play out as time went on,  he added.On this week s  Powerhouse Politics  podcast, Fallon promised greater interaction between Clinton and the press on the campaign trail and said he expects the Democratic nominee to hold a press conference soon. The amount of interaction can only go up,  he said, noting that the traveling press will soon be flying with Clinton on her new campaign plane. I m sure that will bring with it a lot of opportunities for additional access to the candidate and interactions between her and the traveling press corps that covers her every day,  Fallon told ABC News  chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, and political director Rick Klein on the podcast. We are very respectful of the press and the job that they have to do,  Fallon continued.  We have done a lot of interviews, but I know that no matter how many questions we answer in a variety of formats, it is the press s job to always demand more access. We respect that, and so we re going to seek further ways to accommodate that in the remaining months of the campaign. Read more: ABC",politics,"Sep 4, 2016",0,1520
U.S. lawmakers reintroduce bill to end restrictions on Cuba travel,"HAVANA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators reintroduced legislation on Thursday to repeal all restrictions on travel to Cuba, this time attracting far more co-sponsors in a sign of growing support for U.S.-Cuban detente even as its future looks uncertain. The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act was introduced in 2015 by eight Republican and Democratic co-sponsors but never made it to the floor. The latest measure attracted 55 co-sponsors. While efforts to ease the decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba have been gathering strength and 55 votes would be a majority in the 100-member Senate, that number falls short of the 60 needed to advance the legislation. There was no indication the chamber’s Republican leaders would allow the measure to come up for a vote. Republican President Donald Trump threatened during his 2016 election campaign to reverse a normalization of ties with the Communist-run, Caribbean island initiated in 2014 by Democratic President Barack Obama. Trump’s administration is reviewing U.S. policy toward the country’s former Cold War foe. Obama eased trade and travel restrictions, fueling a boom in American visits to Cuba, although tourism was still not officially allowed. On Wednesday, more than 40 U.S. travel companies and organizations urged Trump not to roll back expanded U.S. travel to Cuba.  “It is Americans who are penalized by our travel ban, not the Cuban government,” said U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who with Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy led the group that co-sponsored the bill. Flake added that lifting the ban would give Americans more freedom but also benefit the Cuban people. “This is certain to have positive benefits for the island’s burgeoning entrepreneurial and private sector.” The number of U.S. visitors rose 74 percent last year, boosting business for Cuban hotels, BnBs, restaurants and taxis but also U.S. cruise operators and airlines that entered the market over the past year. “We applaud Senators Flake and Leahy for their leadership in supporting the American and Cuban people by eliminating archaic, outdated policy,” said James Williams, president of the Washington-based Engage Cuba group.  There is still strong congressional opposition to any ending of Cuba’s isolation, led by anti-Castro Cuban-American lawmakers including Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez. They say the United States should not make travel to Cuba easier before the Havana government moves toward democracy. ",politicsNews,"May 25, 2017 ",1,2583
" ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Road Rages, Threatens To Shoot Motorcyclist (VIDEO)","The National Rifle Association tells us that all we need to ensure our safety is a  good guy with a gun    a  responsible gun owner  who carries his weapon around with him, ready to leap into action at the drop of a hat and save the day when a  bad guy with a gun  causes trouble. Unfortunately, a  good guy  and  bad guy  with a gun look exactly the same until someone pulls out a weapon with nefarious intent.A Nevada man narrowly escaped an encounter with a good-guy-turned-bad-guy as he was riding his motorcycle with some friends along the highway. A man in a red pickup truck in a lane flipped a man who told KTNV he wishes to remain unidentified  the bird,  prompting the biker to confront him at a stop light. The man politely tapped on the window of the pickup truck in an effort to inquire as to what he did to enrage the men in the pickup truck. Unfortunately, there was no chance of diplomacy.As the passenger rolls down the window, he wells the driver Get that goddamn gun out, motherf*cker.  The driver, of course, listens. The driver immediately points the gun at the motorcyclist and demands,   Get the f*ck away from me. Asked why he flipped the motorcyclist off, the driver accuses a member of the group of wildly crossing through traffic  something that is not visible on the video the motorcyclist uploaded to YouTube. You re all about to f*cking get shot,  the passenger yells. Fortunately, no one was shot during the incident, and it is being investigated by the Henderson police. The motorcyclist says he regrets approaching the vehicle: No matter how big and bad you are or how much weight you lift, there s always somebody that s bigger and  badder  than you are that will put you in your place real quick. Unfortunately, in this situation, no one was  bigger  or  badder.

China says supports Iraq's unity as Kurds vote in referendum,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China supports Iraq s unity, the country s foreign ministry said on Monday, as voting started in an independence referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, ignoring the threats of the Kurds  neighbors. The vote, expected to deliver a comfortable  yes  for independence, is not binding and is meant to give Massoud Barzani s KRG a mandate to negotiate secession of the oil producing region with Baghdad and neighboring states.[nL8N1M60E9] The referendum is being held despite intense international pressure on Barzani to call it off, amid fears that it would spark fresh conflicts with Baghdad and with Iraq s powerful neighbors, Iran and Turkey.  The Chinese government supports Iraq s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing, when asked about the referendum.  We hope the relevant sides can resolve the differences via dialogue, and find an inclusive solution that takes into account history and reality, to jointly protect Iraqi and regional stability,  Lu added. This will help promote Iraq s rebuilding and counter-terrorism efforts and accords with the joint interests of countries in the region and the international community, he said. China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, is generally a low-key player in the Middle East despite its reliance on the region for oil, but has been trying to get more involved, for example by appointing a special envoy for the Syrian crisis. China says it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other countries internal affairs, but it generally takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world. At home, it contends with what it says are separatist movements in its western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, and has repeatedly expressed concern that self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, could declare formal independence. However, Beijing has expressed more openness toward independence votes when both sides have agreed to them, such as Scotland s unsuccessful 2014 referendum to leave the United Kingdom, and South Sudan s 2011 vote in favor of independence from Sudan.

False Flag Florida: FBI Agents ‘Posing As Terrorists’ in Miami Sting Operation,"21st Century Wire says The FBI is walking a very fine line that crosses into the unacceptable.Watch a video of this report here:The FBI has apparently arrested a man planning an attack on a Miami-area synagogue with an explosive device.The suspect had allegedly planned to attack the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center on Friday evening.The plot, which is about as simple as they come, involved throwing an explosive device over a wall and into the synagogue grounds during Friday night services, as congregants would have been marking the start of Shabbat and the final day of Passover.Most importantly, the synagogue was never actually in any real danger.This is because, the man  was stopped by FBI agents posing as fellow terrorists who set up a sting operation. The bomb, apparently a dummy, was  sold to him in Hallandale Beach by an FBI undercover operative just before the planned terror attack .What this means, is that the suspect James Medina, may have never had the material means to carry out any attack with an explosive device unless it had been provided by the FBI.So why is anybody praising the FBI for stopping a terror attack when they are the very group that facilitated its implementation in the first place?The synagogue s Facebook page issued a statement saying the FBI had even told them that,  there are no credible threats directed against us at the present time. No credible threats  means that the only threat was a fictitious false flag created by the FBI.Democratic Party National Committee head and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, apparently unaware of the finer details, said she was,  deeply grateful that the FBI arrested this individual before he was allegedly able to do harm to the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center .Where do we draw the line between  posing as a terrorist , and actually being a terrorist?How can the FBI be allowed to facilitate such incidents and then claim credit, both financially and politically, for stopping them?ALL THE FALSE FLAG INFO YOU NEED: 21st Century Wire False Flag Files",Middle-east,"May 3, 2016",0,2126
MELANIA TRUMP IN RARE ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW: Watch Her DESTROY Leftist MSNBC Hack On Immigration…”I Followed The Law!”,"Melania Trump has been taking a relatively low key position in her husband s bid to become our next President.

Watch her no-nonsense interview here with leftist MSNBC hack host, Mika Brzezinski, who does everything in her power to provoke her and condemn her husband: I followed the law,  Trump said in an interview with Mika Brzezinski aired Wednesday on MSNBC s  Morning Joe,  in discussing the hoops she had to jump through in order to become a citizen of the United States.  I never thought to stay here without papers. I had a visa, I traveled every few months back to the country to Slovenia to stamp the visa. I came back, I applied for the green card, I applied for the citizenship later on after many years of green card. So I went by system, I went by the law. And you should do that, you should not just say let me stay here and whatever happens, happens. Trump, who immigrated to the United States from Slovenia in 1996, said that she and her husband are  prepared  for people to call him names for expressing his viewpoints.  I m a full-time mom, and I love it. So, I decided not to be in the campaign so much, but I support my husband 100 percent,  she said of her role in the campaign itself. We have thick skin, and we know that people will judge him and people will call names. They don t give him enough credit.

Low turnout in Chile election could hand victory to Pinera,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The frontrunner for Chile s presidency, billionaire businessman Sebastian Pinera, faces an array of left-wing parties in this year s elections but he can expect help from one quarter - low turnout. Recent opinion polls give Pinera, a conservative former president, a commanding lead over his seven mostly left-of-center rivals for the Nov. 19 first round but predict he is unlikely to take the more than 50 percent needed to avoid a run-off. While a unified left might muster the votes to defeat Pinera in the second round, weak turnout fed by disenchantment with politics and interparty bickering would pave the way for a Pinera win.  It s likely that many left-wing voters are not going to vote in the second round because their candidate will have been eliminated, and with this drop, Pinera s vote share catapults,  said analyst Kenneth Bunker, of Tresquintos.   Pinera is going to win if fewer people vote.  Investors strongly favor Pinera and bet he would better manage labor and education reforms implemented by current center-left President Michelle Bachelet, in power since 2014. Chile, South America s most developed economy, is one of the few countries in the region that does not have mandatory voting.  Turnout in the elections following Chile s transition from compulsory to voluntary voting in 2012 has dipped as low as 42 percent, near the bottom of developed countries, according to statistics from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Many Chileans are disenchanted with politics following campaign finance scandals that have tainted parties of both the right and left. Unlike citizens of Brazil, Peru and Argentina, they have the right to abstain without repercussions. A recent CEP poll, conducted in September and October, found that only 43 percent of Chileans are likely to vote in the coming election. The poll showed Pinera would beat his two closest contenders, the center-left Alejandro Guillier and leftist Beatriz Sanchez, in a Dec. 17 runoff. Coalitions of Chile s center-left parties for decades dominated politics but have fractured in the face of disagreements over Bachelet s economic and social reforms. The CEP poll found that only 11 percent of voters sympathize with Bachelet s Nueva Mayoria coalition and nearly 60 percent of Chileans did not identify with any of the major political parties.  Pinera s campaign has sought to capitalize on growing discontent and division among the left by appealing to centrist Christian Democratic voters, historically the largest bloc within Bachelet s coalition. Pinera recently called former President Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democrat credited with smoothing Chile s transition to democracy in the 1990s, an  example to follow.  Candidates on the left have sought to counteract Pinera s advances by attempting to rally new voters.  We need a program that makes sense for everyone. If voter participation increases, we win,  said center-left frontrunner Guillier, a former journalist and legislator. In late October, Bachelet s administration launched a get-out-the-vote campaign of television and radio advertisements, calling the election  an important moment for our democracy.  Pinera has criticized the campaign as a political maneuver, but Maria Luisa Puig, of the Eurasia Group, said that motivating a large remaining block of undecided, or uninspired, voters in the center of the political spectrum could prove critical to both sides.  Voter turnout will be the key to this election,  she said. ",worldnews,"November 6, 2017 ",1,3594

NBC, Univision, and the Mexican media company Televisa all recently announced they would not show Trump s Miss Universe Organization beauty pageants because of his comments about immigrants. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best; they re not sending you,  Trump said in his June announcement speech, according to a transcript.  They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us. They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. Trump, who said he was criticizing the Mexican government and not its people, has aggressively responded to the companies that are ending their relationships with him. He said he was suing Univision for $500 million. He denounced NBC as  weak.  And he insisted that he was the one cutting ties with Macy s   not the other way around.He also argued that the Macy s snub proved how difficult it was for billionaires like him to seek political office.

Police question Netanyahu for fifth time in corruption case,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday for the fifth time over suspicions of corruption, Israeli media reported. A Reuters cameraman saw police investigators arrive by car late in the day to Netanyahu s official residence, where previous interrogations have taken place.  Officials with the police and Netanyahu s office declined to comment to Reuters on their visit, but Israel media, without citing sources, widely reported he was being questioned again. No charges have been brought against Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009 and has denied wrongdoing. He is a suspect in two cases, one involving the receipt of gifts from businessmen and the other related to conversations he held with an Israeli newspaper publisher about limiting competition in the news sector in exchange for more positive coverage. Police said earlier this week that a top Netanyahu confidant had been questioned as part of a different investigation into a $2 billion submarine deal with Germany.

As it turns out   the mainstream media was completely wrong   while we were right. This was an elaborate federally managed cover-up from the beginning.21WIRE reported at the time the obvious contradiction; without any audio track to synch with the FBI s aerial footage it was impossible to know when shots were fired and if the official story was actually true. As part of the federal cover-up, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Greg Bretzing, insisted that their footage provided an honest and unfiltered view of what happened. It wasn t   and new evidence told a completely different story, exposing the official story as a lie from the onset.Finicum was shot three times in the back An autopsy revealed with one of the bullets piercing Finicum s heart.The obvious problem with how these latest legal proceedings are being framed is this: Finicum is execute with three shots to the back after a pre-planned federal ambush, while the hired federal gunman who pulled the trigger is indicted for   lying.

As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team,  McCabe wrote in the email. He said he had no input when the Clinton email investigation started in summer 2015, while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the FBI s Washington office. [The Washington office] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a  special  and I was not given any details about it,  he wrote.FBI officials on Wednesday night refused to answer what McCabe meant by calling the Clinton email probe a  special  or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began. We don t have anything to add to the documents that were released,  bureau spokeswoman Carol Cratty wrote The Hill.The note was contained in more than 70 pages of emails the FBI released on its public records site known as The Vault.The emails chronicled McCabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s 2015 campaign for political office.McCabe s references to a  special  status for the Clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by Republican lawmakers critical of former FBI Director James Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation.Remember that the DOJ s Loretta Lynch also wanted Clinton s case to be called an  incident  and not an investigation.

Israel shoots down Iranian-made drone over Syrian frontier: military,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel shot down a pilotless plane over the Golan Heights on Tuesday and said it was probably an Iranian-built aircraft on a  reconnaissance mission for the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group along Israel s frontier with Syria. The incident came hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to address the U.N. General Assembly and cite Israeli concerns about an entrenchment in Syria of Iranian and Hezbollah forces that have been helping Damascus beat back Islamist-led rebels. The drone was launched from an air base near Damascus and was downed with a Patriot interceptor missile over the Golan demilitarized zone that has separated Israeli and Syrian forces since the ceasefire deal that followed their 1973 war, the military said.   As we understand, it was on a reconnaissance mission along the border and the Golan Heights on behalf of Hezbollah,  a military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, told reporters.  Our intelligence suggests it was ... Iranian-made.  Asked whether the drone might have been armed, Conricus said that information was not yet available. He said Israeli warplanes had also been scrambled. Officials from Syria, Hezbollah and Iran had no immediate comment on the incident. The Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 conflict, has seen spillover violence from the Syrian civil war. Israel has at times fired to foil what it deemed deliberate cross-border attacks.

Trump to meet with business leaders on infrastructure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to meet with a group of infrastructure business leaders at the White House on Wednesday, a person briefed on the meeting said. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads, bridges, airports and other public works projects. The lunch meeting is set to include real estate, management consulting, private equity and other business leaders, along with at least one environmental group, a person briefed on the matter said. Last month, Trump touted the plan in an address to Congress. “The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding,” Trump said.  “To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States - financed through both public and private capital - creating millions of new jobs.” The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. infrastructure at D+ and estimated the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told Fox News last month that the needs for infrastructure are so great the federal government cannot shoulder all the costs. “Public private partnerships are a very important part of a new way of financing our roads and bridges that are in disrepair and our very dangerous,” Chao said.     In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at expediting environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially high priority projects “such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.” ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2017 ",1,1796
"MEXICANS, Liberal Tourists NOT HAPPY! American Spring Breakers Chant “Build That Wall!” In Cancun, Mexico","In the past, high school kids have had to worry about getting into the college of their choice, if pictures of them overindulging in adult beverages while on spring break were posted to social media.

"Trump packs transition team with Washington veterans, review shows","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged on the campaign trail to “drain the swamp” in Washington, is staffing his on-the-ground transition teams mostly with government veterans, including ex-lobbyists, a Reuters review of publicly available information shows. Drawing heavily from former military, congressional and  agency staff, he has named about 140 operatives to “landing teams” at various government departments to smooth the transition to a new Trump administration. The Reuters review found that about 80 percent of them have prior government experience. At least 25 of them have done lobbying work at some point in their careers, and at least six appeared to be actively working as registered lobbyists up until November. Trump made getting rid of insiders a key tenet of his campaign. “We have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices a chance to go into government,” Trump said on Oct. 18.  Historically, it isn’t unusual for presidents-elect to staff their landing teams with government veterans and it probably helps, said experts on presidential transitions.  “If you were really trying to drain the swamp ... you want to get people who actually understand the terrain,” said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group focused on government service. For instance, Sharon Brown-Hruska is on several Trump landing teams, including one for the market-regulating Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She is a former CFTC commissioner. Brown-Hruska could not be reached for comment.  Shawn Krause, who is on the housing and urban development transition team, represents mortgage lender Quicken Loans in Washington as chief of its government advocacy program. Krause was a registered lobbyist until early November, when she deregistered because she had not actively lobbied for some time, Bill Emerson, chief executive at Quicken Loans told Reuters. Nova Daly, who lobbied for the aluminum extrusion industry, is on Trump’s trade office landing team. Reached by email, Daly said he had terminated all his lobbying activity. Jessica Ditto, deputy communications director for the Trump transition, said the presence of Daly, Krause and others on the landing teams was not at odds with Trump’s campaign statements about the country being run poorly or about getting rid of bureaucrats who don’t create jobs. “These volunteers who have experience in government are going to help us ensure that we understand the areas that need to be fixed,” she said. Trump’s transition rules require landing team members to sign a code of conduct requiring them to agree not to lobby for six months after they complete their work. A five-year ban is being applied by Trump to actual administration hires.    Trump has nominated some figures from the Washington establishment to top posts, including Elaine Chao, a former labor secretary who is his nominee for transportation secretary. Norm Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, is skeptical about the appointment of Washington veterans to the transition teams. “Those draining the swamp will be alligators themselves,” he said.  But Steve Moore, a Trump policy adviser who is not a formal part of the transition, said, “If you want an incredibly ambitious legislative agenda in your first 100 days ... having people with political savvy and knowing how to pass laws and how the process works is a real asset.” ",politicsNews,"December 1, 2016 ",1,3555
White House says Trump did not know Flynn was representing Turkey,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump did not know until this week that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had been working as a representative for Turkey, although the issue was raised with the Trump team before the Republican took office. Flynn acted as a foreign agent representing the interests of Turkey’s government in exchange for more than $500,000 during last year’s presidential campaign even as he was advising  Trump, the New York Times said on Friday.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Flynn’s lobbying was a personal and business matter, and it was up to him to decide when to register. Asked if Trump had not been aware that former general Flynn was working as a foreign agent, Spicer said: “Correct... You wouldn’t know that until he filed. He didn’t file until two days ago.”  Some U.S. lawmakers have questioned Flynn’s relationship with the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Before Trump’s inauguration, Flynn’s ties to Turkey were widely reported and he wrote an article urging the United States to cultivate better relations with Erdogan. Trump fired Flynn last month for discussing U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office on Jan. 20 and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Before Trump took office, Flynn’s lawyer contacted the presidential transition team about his work for Turkey to ask what he should do, Spicer said. The lawyer was told “it was up to the personal lawyer to work with the appropriate authorities ... to determine what was appropriate and what was not appropriate in terms of filing,” Spicer said. “We trust people to fill out the forms that they are required to do so in an honest and legal manner, and in this case he retroactively filed the forms he was supposed to do,” he said. “We did the right thing then, and we expect every employee to follow the law.” Spicer said he did not know whether Flynn had disclosed his lobbying work in the security clearance review before he became national security adviser.

ARMY THREATENS GREEN BERET WAR HERO WITH COURT MARTIAL For Whistleblowing On Failed Hostage Rescue,"The Army can t be bothered with defending or protecting war heroes, they re too busy with other more pressing issues like ensuring gays are free to come out of the closet and removing any trace of Christianity from our military bases.A Green Beret war hero under investigation for unauthorized communications with Congress will testify on Thursday that the Army is out to court-martial him on criminal charges.Meanwhile, Rep. Duncan Hunter, one of the lawmakers with whom the soldier spoke about Obama administration hostage rescue policies, has asked the Pentagon inspector general to investigate whether the Army is springing allegations against personnel such as the Green Beret as pure retaliation.Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, the Special Forces soldier, is due to testify before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs about what he considers reprisals against him as a whistleblower. After I made protected disclosures to Congress, the Army suspended my clearance, removed me from my job, launched a criminal investigation and deleted my retirement orders with a view to court martial me after I exercised that Constitutional right,  says Col. Amerine, according to partial remarks provided to The Washington Times by Mr. Hunter s office. For nearly five months, I have received no relief from the military and there has been no transparency in their investigation of me. My pay was even stopped briefly after the Army deleted my retirement orders. Mr. Hunter, California Republican and member of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote to Jon T. Rymer, the inspector general, about three soldiers against whom he believed Army Secretary John McHugh retaliated. He asked for an IG investigation into Mr. McHugh s use of the Criminal Investigation Command. Specifically, my concern is that the Army   under the leadership of Secretary of the Army   has used CID for the purpose of influencing actions/outcomes and retaliating against soldiers,  he wrote.He cited three soldiers:  Col. Amerine. The officer worked in a small Army unit at the Pentagon and he devoted himself to developing policies to gain the release of Americans held by Islamic extremists. He came to believe the administration s hostage policies were in disarray and told Mr. Hunter. The congressman proposed legislation to create a hostage coordinator to work with the various agencies involved, such as the FBI, Pentagon and State Department.  Maj. Matt Golsteyn. Also a Green Beret, Maj. Golsteyn saw his valor awards and Special Forces tab stripped by Secretary McHugh. The officer was accused of killing a Taliban bomb-maker, but was never officially charged. He faces a board of inquiry hearing.  Sgt. First Class Earl Plumlee. Sgt. Plumlee was nominated for the Medal of Honor, the nation s highest military award, for repelling an attack on a base in Afghanistan and saving lives. The MOH was endorsed by top commanders, including Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Mr. McHugh downgraded the award to a Silver Star. Mr. Hunter said it was based on a  questionable CID investigation. Col. Amerine already has filed a whistleblower retaliation complaint with the IG. The Army probe began after the FBI complained that Col. Amerine was providing information to Congress. I have personally met with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the developments leading up to the Army investigation,  Mr. Hunter told Mr. Rymer.  An investigation, I firmly believe, was not warranted, but continues to be unjustifiably delayed. Col. Amerine holds a special place in the history of the Afghanistan war. He led a joint Green Beret-Afghan team in the 2001 invasion, and fought along side Hamid Karzai, the future president.An Army spokesman has said,  As a matter of policy, we do not confirm the names of individuals who may or may not be under investigation to protect the integrity of a possible ongoing investigation, as well as the privacy rights of all involved. However, I note that both the law and Army policy would prohibit initiating an investigation based solely on a Soldier s protected communications with.Via: Washington Times ",politics,"Jun 12, 2015",0,4275

 Trump Says ‘Illegals’ Are Here To Chop Up Teen Girls With Knives Because Shooting Them Isn’t Painful Enough,"Holy f*ckballs, Trump s rallies are lit these days.

Chinese police detain teacher in kindergarten abuse inquiry,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing police investigating alleged child abuse at a kindergarten run by RYB Education Inc said on Saturday they had detained a teacher, in the latest scandal to hit China s booming childcare industry. Police in the Chaoyang district said it will further investigate claims of abuse after China s official Xinhua news agency reported this week they were checking allegations that children at the nursery were  reportedly sexually molested, pierced by needles and given unidentified pills . Chaoyang district police said in an online posting on Saturday they had detained a 22-year-old teacher, surnamed Liu from the Hebei province adjacent to Beijing. Police have also arrested another person, also surnamed Liu, for allegedly disrupting social order by spreading false information about the alleged kindergarten abuse, it said in a separate posting. RYB s New York-listed shares plunged 38.4 percent on Friday as the scandal sparked outrage among parents and the public.      The second woman, 31, and a Beijing native, was arrested on Thursday, police said. Parents said their children, some as young as three, gave accounts of a naked adult male conducting purported  medical check-ups  on unclothed students, other media said.  RYB provides early education services in China and at the end of June was operating 80 kindergartens and had franchised an additional 175, covering 130 cities and towns in China.   Meanwhile, Beijing city authorities have urged RYB to remove the head of the kindergarten, Xinhua reported. The Chaoyang district has launched an investigation into all childcare facilities in its area, the report said.  ",worldnews,"November 25, 2017 ",1,1714
"HANDPICKED SUCCESSOR And Son Of DISGRACED Lawmaker John Conyers Reportedly Body-Slammed, Spit Upon and Slit His Girlfriend With Knife","The disgraced Representative John Conyers (D-MI) was not about to quit his job as an elected official before he hand-selected his son as his successor. Never mind that his son has absolutely no experience in politics. His last name is  Conyers , and that s apparently enough for the 88-year old politician. But is that really all they need to know about the 27-year old son of the disgraced lawmaker and the former Detroit councilwoman, Monica Conyers, who was recently released from prison after serving 2 years of a 3-year term for bribery?  And should anyone be surprised by anything that comes out of the mouth of the 88-year old lawmaker, who, in 2010, was caught on video, as he brazenly read a Playboy magazine on a domestic flight in plain view of other passengers, and who has recently been accused by multiple women of either sexually assaulting or attempting to sexually assault them.  John Conyers III also has an interesting background.According to NBC News, on February Feb. 15, John Conyers was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse but wasn t charged, after his girlfriend called the police. The unidentified woman said the younger Conyers accused her of cheating on him, then  body slammed her on the bed and then on the floor where he pinned her down and spit on her,  according to a district attorney s report quoted by NBC News. The woman claimed that Conyers III took her phone when she tried to call the police, he chased her into the kitchen and swung a knife at her, resulting in a cut on her arm.Conyers III asserted that the woman had been drinking and using marijuana and tried to throw him out of her home before they began pushing and shoving one another. He said she threatened him with a knife and cut herself as they struggled.NBC reported that the Los Angeles County District Attorney s Office chose not to move forward with the case, citing a  lack of independent witnesses  and investigators  conclusions that it  could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim s injury was not accidentally sustained.    FOX NewsConyers III also likes to think of himself as a  rapper . He recently made this video where interestingly, he refers to his father as a f*cking player  : Conyers III also caused public headaches for his father in 2010.Chicago Tribune   In 2010, MLive.com reported that John Conyers III was cited for speeding in his father s Cadillac Escalade   or rather, the government-leased vehicle his father used as a member of Congress.There were also reports that year that the younger Conyers had driven the vehicle to a rap concert and that it was broken into, according to MLive.com. The then-20-year-old reported to police that two laptops had been stolen from the Cadillac, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of concert tickets.After the incident, the elder Conyers apologized.",politics,"Dec 6, 2017",0,2982
Factbox: Key court cases shed light on U.S. Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch,"(Reuters) - Neil Gorsuch has taken part in more than 2,000 court cases as an appeals court judge. Here are seven that offer insights into his legal views as he faces questioning this week in a U.S. Senate hearing on his nomination to become a Supreme Court justice. Frozen trucker         Transam Trucking Inc v. Department of Labor, 2016 (bit.ly/2aUK2Ub) This case shows, liberals say, that Gorsuch rules for employers at the expense of workers. In it, he dissented from a three-judge panel that ruled in favor of truck driver Alphonse Maddin. He was fired after he disobeyed a supervisor and abandoned his trailer at roadside after its brakes froze. The panel ruled he was wrongly terminated. Gorsuch disagreed. ‘Chevron deference’ Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch (2016) (bit.ly/2bLfVgE) In an immigration case, Gorsuch criticized the “Chevron deference” legal doctrine that says courts should defer to federal agencies on interpreting the law. Gorsuch said it concentrates federal power “in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution.” If the court were to roll back the doctrine, presidents would have less leeway to interpret the law when issuing regulations through agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. ‘Class clown’     A.M. v Holmes, 2016 (bit.ly/29VN4Jy) Republicans say Gorsuch does not put politics above the law and follows his own path. In some criminal cases, he has come down hard on prosecutors or government officials, while also sometimes defying colleagues on the bench. In this case, he decried the handcuffing and arrest of a seventh-grade “class clown” in Albuquerque who refused to stop burping in class, saying the police officer involved should not have gotten immunity from suit. Paraphrasing Charles Dickens, he said the law is not as much of an “ass” as to allow for that.  ‘No trespassing’ U.S. v Carloss 2016  (bit.ly/2nLGzw3) Standing up for homeowners’ property rights, Gorsuch dissented from a decision to admit evidence discovered by police officers who approached, and later entered, a home despite several “No trespassing” signs outside. He lampooned the idea that the government can knock on anyone’s door, at any time, saying homeowners might be surprised to learn that “No trespassing signs have become little more than lawn art.” Transgender rights Druley v Patton (2015) (bit.ly/2ntFcEV) In a ruling highlighted by liberal activists as a sign he may be hostile to gay and transgender rights, Gorsuch joined a ruling against a transgender Oklahoma state prisoner who claimed prison officials violated her rights by denying her adequate hormone therapy and housing her with men. The court rejected her claims, saying she had not proved she would be “irreparably harmed without her requested hormone treatment.”  Employee rights Hwang v. Kansas State University, 2014 (bit.ly/SsXD8J) In a case criticized by liberals, Gorsuch wrote the opinion when a three-judge panel ruled against Kansas State University professor Grace Hwang. She got six months of sick leave from the school when she was diagnosed with cancer. When she asked for more time, Kansas State refused. Hwang alleged illegal disability discrimination. Gorsuch said Hwang was a capable teacher and was legally disabled. But he wrote: “There’s also no question she wasn’t able to perform the essential functions of her job even with a reasonable accommodation.” He said the law was not intended to “turn employers into safety net providers for those who cannot work.” Hwang has since died. Religious freedom Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, 2013 (bit.ly/2func5k) Liberals say this case shows Gorsuch sides with corporations over people and favors religious liberty over other interests, including womens’ contraceptive rights. Retailer Hobby Lobby argued it should not have to provide insurance coverage for female employees’ birth control, defying a rule by the administration of former President Barack Obama. Gorsuch concurred in an opinion favoring the company and expressed sympathy for evangelical Christian business owners. The Supreme Court later upheld the decision for the company.

 Swastika-Covered Guy Gets Punched In The Face Outside Nazi Rally And It’s Beautiful (VIDEO),"One Nazi made the mistake of leaving his  safe space  at a rally featuring infamous Nazi Richard Spencer and learned, like Spencer did at Donald Trump s inauguration, that most Americans hate his kind and just want to punch him in the face.Punching Nazis has been a controversial issue among liberals, with some saying we should hug it out with them and it will magically erase the hate and the rest of us agreeing with our family members who fought in World War II that if you see a Nazi you should probably punch him (my grandfather didn t leave most of his hip in Europe so I could hug Nazis back home, for instance)   and while some members of a crowd of protesters worked to escort the Nazi to safety, at least one person did the right thing and punched him in the f*cking mouth.The self-defense strike (no violence against a Nazi can be rightfully considered an attack) occurred at a rally in Gainesville, Florida when a man wearing a t-shirt covered in swastikas tried to walk past a group of anti-racism demonstrators. Leave him go,  a well-meaning but delusional protester can be heard shouting in video of the incident as others provide protection to the Nazi, who can be seen wearing a smug expression on his face. One of his escorts even had his arm around him like they were the best of pals:First scuffle. This man with swastikas on his shirt was surrounded by protestors.

THE STATE THAT GETS MORE REFUGEES THAN ANY OTHER IN AMERICA MAY SURPRISE YOU,"Here s one sure way to turn a solidly  red  state  blue In Fiscal year 2014, Texas resettled 7,234 refugees. However, that doesn t tell the whole story because according to the Texas Dept. of State Health Services (an excellent source of information on refugees in Texas), the actual number of migrants legally being treated as refugees last year was really 12,800 (up 24% from the previous year!).The website also tells you which counties got the most refugees.The 12,800 includes refugees, asylees, parolees, special immigrant visa holders (these are Afghans and Iraqis), and victims of trafficking.They hailed from 58 countries (therefore Texas taxpayers are on the hook for many expensive translators gratis a Bill Clinton executive order for all sorts of reasons access to health care, school system problems and the criminal justice system).When I went to several different sources, I find that over 150,000 refugees have been resettled in Texas since 1983, and that number doesn t include secondary migrants from other states (Dallas County got the most secondary migrants last year 60% of all those arriving in Texas).And, of course, it doesn t include all of the children produced in three decades! Nor does it include the thousands of  unaccompanied alien children  that may not have been distributed around the nation from last year s border invasion. Obama would like nothing more than to have them declared  refugees  as well (refugees get all forms of welfare upon arrival!).The top resettlement cities in Texas are (resettlement is not limited to these sites, dozens and dozens of smaller cities and towns are receiving refugees):AbileneAmarilloAustinCorpus ChristiDallasEl PasoFort WorthHoustonSan AntonioFor new readers, you might want to have a look at our archive on Amarillo which has developed into a  pocket of resistance  as the mayor there has asked the federal government to slow the flow since the school system is suffering with the influx of non-English speaking children many of whom are illiterate in their own language. The meatpacking industry is responsible for much of the resettlement to Amarillo (hunger for cheap labor!).The top nations from which Texas received refugees in 2014 were in this order: Iraq, Cuba, Burma, Afghanistan, and tied for 5th place Somalia and Bhutan(Nepal).So when did Texas move into the number one spot in the nation?For years and years other states ranked above Texas including California, New York and Florida. According to this very cool graph (above right), it was in 2011 that Texas gained this dubious distinction.And, if you are wondering why the number dipped in 2011, this is why: That year it was learned that Iraqi terrorists disguised as refugees were arrested in Kentucky. Turns out the pair had lied (can you believe it, they lied!) on their refugee application and it was only when they were found to be planning on helping Al-Qaeda in Iraq was it discovered that one of them had left fingerprints on an IED shard that was warehoused by the US military. The shard came from an IED that had killed Pennsylvania National Guard troops. They are in prison for life.The arrest threw the Refugee Admissions Program of the US State Department into chaos because they had to re-screen thousands and thousands of Iraqis headed to America. Iraqis make up the largest ethnic group we are admitting to America now at a rate of about 20,000 a year. The majority are Muslims (both Shiites and Sunnis as we import their centuries old squabble to your towns!).IT S PROBABLY NO ACCIDENT THAT BARACK OBAMA GAVE THE  Teacher of the year  award to Shanna Peoples,  A high school English teacher from Amarillo, Texas, who works with refugees:In order to question this 35-year-old legal immigration program, you must first get the facts!* Read our Fact Sheet, here.

" Unarmed Black Man Tortured, Maimed, Then Executed By Mississippi Cop (VIDEO)","On the night of June 18, Tupelo, Mississippi police officer Tyler Cook pulled over a vehicle for what authorities say was a  routine traffic stop. Minutes later, Ronnie Shumpert, a 37-year-old Black father of five, was brutalized, maimed and tortured by that officer. Then he was shot dead.It was 9:38 pm when officer Cook pulled over the vehicle Shumpert was driving. The car belonged to his friend, Charles Foster. Foster was with Shumpert in the car. He witnessed much of what happened that night.Shumpert had a felony warrant for his arrest, yet there s no way the officer could have known that at the time of the traffic stop. He was never ID d. The car he was driving was not registered in his name. To officer Cook, he was just another Black man behind the wheel of a car.As soon as Cook pulled the car over Shumpert ran. Officer Cook pursued him with a police canine.According to witnesses, Shumpert was hiding underneath a house when Cook found him.Police say he immediately attacked the officer and the dog. Witnesses say otherwise. Foster and others say Shumpert immediately tried to surrender, but Cook turned the dog loose on the unarmed man. It attacked his groin, ripping off his testicles.Autopsy photos show that there were deep gashes across his body. Several of Shumpert s teeth were knocked out, others were shoved into his gums.By this time Ronnie Shumpert was likely bleeding out from a gash so large  you could fit a baseball in it.  His testicles had been shredded by a vicious attack dog and he was suffering from devastating facial wounds. Yet Cook claims that the unarmed father was still a threat. That s why he had to execute him.According to Foster, less than five minutes passed before officer Cook shot Shumpert dead. He fired four shots. Three bullets ripped through Ronnie Shumpert s chest. A fourth bullet entered his stomach.Police say it was ten minutes before an ambulance was called. The nearest hospital was less than a minute away. Video from the night of the lynching shows an ambulance arriving one hour after Cook fired his weapon.Officer Cook has had excessive force complaints filed against him before. The most recent complaint was filed less than two months ago.According to Tupelo s white city attorney, Ben Logan, any accusations of racial profiling, police brutality and corruption in connection with the death of Ronnie Shumpert are  just ridiculous. During a press conference held on June 27, Logan showed no concern over the nature and extent of Shumpert s injuries. Instead, he accused the dead man s family of being  instigators,  claiming that their cries for justice are  endangering the peace of the community. Rather than being upset over the brutal torture and unjustifiable death of an unarmed Tupelo resident, Logan went on to stress that he is  upset  about statements made by the Shumpert family attorney, Carlos Moore, saying they shine a  bad light  on attorneys.Moore is calling on the Department of Justice to investigate the death of Ronnie Shumpert, as well as the  entire Tupelo police department.  The family is demanding that officer Cook be immediately terminated from the police force. They also want the canine that bit off Ronnie Shumpert s testicles retired immediately.Shumpert s family is also seeking answers from the police department. Some of the questions are about officer Cook s history and length of time on the force. They also want to know why the first ambulance arrived on the scene an hour after Ronnie Shumpert was shot.Aside from these demands, Moore is calling for the establishment of an independent citizen s review board to oversee accusations of police brutality and excessive force in Tupelo.Tupelo police are not equipped with body cameras. That s not acceptable in 2016.As reported by the Atlanta Black Star, New York Daily News and other media outlets, this was a modern day lynching. Out of sight of cameras, Officer Cook allowed his canine to mutilate Ronnie Shumpert in the most brutal way possible.Witness testimony shows that Shumpert was trying to surrender when Officer Cook and the canine attacked him. Autopsy photos demonstrate that after being brutalized by Cook and his attack dog, he was defenseless at the time the officer opened fire on him.Moore, accompanied by Ronnie Shumpert s family, held a press conference on June 27.Here s video from both the Shumpert family s press conference and the press conference held by Tupelo city attorney, Ben Logan, courtesy of Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal on YouTube.

U.S. derivatives regulator to move on from Dodd-Frank under Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator will move on from reforms undertaken after the 2007-09 financial crisis to a new focus on U.S. competitiveness and the potential for shocks to the global $710 trillion swaps markets under President-elect Donald Trump. J. Christopher Giancarlo, in line to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission once Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, has said the agency should look beyond mandates from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to current trends in financial markets. He counts among those cyber threats, liquidity risk, market concentration and de-globalization. As the sole Republican on the CFTC, Giancarlo will at least temporarily run the commission where he is currently the minority member.  Even if Trump later nominates someone else for the permanent post, Giancarlo, who was previously an executive vice president at GFI Group, a wholesale brokerage that runs electronic trading platforms, will be influential in the coming months. In a speech in London on Friday, he said regulators should foster best practices for new trading technologies, address diminishing liquidity, and review regulations that could cause market fragmentation as they enter “the new year and, perhaps, a new regulatory environment.” This week, he forced the commission to delay limits on the positions that traders can hold on physical commodity futures and swaps. Redrawn position limit rules are likely to reappear in 2017, as are the following other agenda items. Giancarlo has often argued the United States should not move too far ahead of other countries in tightening regulations governing the swaps market, which the United States dominates. That could put U.S. firms at a disadvantage and drive up trading costs, he says.  In August he warned the CFTC could create a liquidity crunch by sticking to its September deadline for implementing a new swaps margin rule, given European regulators had delayed start dates for their similar rules. Indeed, in September Asian swaps markets foundered and trades fell through as the U.S. rules came online. The CFTC then gave swap dealers an extra month to comply. “Championing American markets means no longer asking U.S. market participants to go it alone and take it on the chin in implementation of global regulatory reform,” Giancarlo later told the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “Rather, it means standing up for America’s capital and risk transfer markets and treating them as the vital national interests that they are.”  Giancarlo sees the CFTC as “stuck in a 20th Century time warp” when it comes to technology.  He can be expected to push the CFTC toward giving industry space for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence guiding trade execution, “smart” contracts that calculate payments and value in real-time, and distributed ledger technology, known as Blockchain.  In November he voted against the “Reg AT” - Regulation Automated Trading - to update oversight of fast computer trades,  criticizing it for not adequately protecting algorithmic trading companies’ prized source codes and being too prescriptive.  Giancarlo says regulators in other countries, notably Britain, are leading the way in financial technology and the CFTC must follow in making room to experiment. Since 2012, any dealer with more than $8 billion in swap activity has had to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which subjects it to stricter federal oversight. That activity value in dollars, known as the “de minimis” threshold, was poised to fall to $3 billion by the end of 2017, but the CFTC recently delayed the drop by a year. Under Giancarlo, the threshold may never fall - or could disappear altogether.  He has called the thresholds “made up numbers” lacking policy justification. He also said that in general, a specific de minimis level may not do anything to optimize “the safety, soundness, liquidity or vibrancy of U.S. swaps markets.”  In March, Giancarlo failed to launch recommendations on regulating energy markets made by a committee he led, which was dominated by people from the energy sector. Reform proponents said the suggestions were sops to industry and he withdrew its report. When he is in charge, Giancarlo could turn back to the committee’s work. It questioned the need for new position limits and suggested an alternative “accountability system,” where exchanges could grant exemptions to limits. ",politicsNews,"December 8, 2016 ",1,4510

SEC's foreign corruption unit chief to leave by month's end,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, the attorney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who oversees the unit that polices foreign bribery laws, plans to depart the SEC later this month, the regulator announced Tuesday. Brockmeyer, a 17-year veteran of the SEC, has led the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) unit since 2011.  The unit was one of five specialty areas created in 2010 in an effort to bolster the SEC’s enforcement program following revelations over the agency’s repeated failures to detect Bernard Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme. Brockmeyer oversaw a wide array of FCPA cases, including charges against hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC and its chief executive Daniel Och over bribery in Africa, charges against JPMorgan Chase & Co following the so-called “princeling” investigation into hiring practices in China in order to win business and charges against Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA over bribes paid in a variety of countries. The SEC said that after Brockmeyer departs, the unit’s current deputy chief Charles Cain will serve as acting chief until a permanent replacement is named. The SEC’s enforcement of the FCPA is an area that is being actively watched by the defense bar, after President Donald Trump previously made disparaging remarks about the law and called for it to be changed. Trump’s pick to lead the SEC, Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton, also previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced. Clayton, whose nomination was approved by the Senate Banking Committee earlier on Tuesday, is still awaiting confirmation by the full Senate. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have previously raised concerns about whether he will actively pursue FCPA cases. In written responses to questions from the panel’s top Democrat Sherrod Brown following his confirmation hearing, Clayton said he believes the law can be a “powerful and effective means” to combating corruption.  He added, however, that it is more effective when international authorities are also willing to coordinate and take enforcement actions against bribery, as opposed to having the United States go at it alone.

North Korea-U.S. tensions are not Mexico's business: diplomat,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - North Korea s ambassador to Mexico on Friday said its tensions with the United States were not Mexico City s business after President Enrique Pena Nieto ordered that he leave the country in protest over Pyongyang s nuclear tests.  Mexico on Thursday said it had given the ambassador, Kim Hyong Gil, 72 hours to leave Mexico in order to express its  absolute rejection  of North Korea s recent nuclear activity, describing it as a grave threat to the region and the world. The North Korean ambassador branded the move as  ignorant  and said disagreement over the country s nuclear program was an issue for the United States and  has nothing to do with Mexico.   That is why I express great displeasure at the bilateral diplomatic measures taken by the Mexican government that claims to have a sovereign foreign policy. That (claim) is without basis,  he told reporters outside the North Korean embassy in Mexico City. Mexico has traditionally sought to steer clear of diplomatic spats, but in the past few months it has adopted robust language to condemn the governments of Venezuela and North Korea as they descended into increasing international isolation. Mexico s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, has led the diplomatic push as he also seeks to convince the United States to keep the North American Free Trade Agreement in place. Mexico s move follows a tide of international condemnation of North Korea for repeated missile launches and the test of a powerful nuclear weapon in recent weeks. Videgaray on Friday stressed that Mexico was not breaking diplomatic ties with North Korea, but that the country  wanted to send a clear message of absolute rejection  of the recent tests.

'Nasty woman' and Ken Bone: election's viral stars a hit for Halloween,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the U.S. election just days away, Americans can expect to see an occasional “nasty woman” and “basket of deplorables” knocking on doors this Halloween alongside the usual parade of goblins, ghosts and ghouls. Revelers are planning costumes inspired by the campaign for the Nov. 8 election, seeking catharsis and humor at the end of the often bitterly fought White House race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ted Wright, a marketing executive from Atlanta, said he and his wife were planning to dress as a “bad hombre” and “nasty woman,” respectively, references to Trump’s much-ridiculed remarks about some Mexican immigrants and Clinton during a presidential debate on Oct. 19. “This is one of those elections where it’s very difficult to discuss [it] in polite company,” said Wright, 49, a Republican who said he would not vote for Trump. “That is why we’re going ‘bad hombre’ and we’re going ‘nasty woman.’” Hannah Hemperly, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, said she planned to dress up as a “nasty woman” as well. “When (Trump) was calling (Clinton) a ‘nasty woman,’ I think I just felt solidarity with Hillary,” said Hemperly, who lives in Chicago and planned to vote for the Democratic nominee.  Jake West, who works at a Chicago-area architecture firm, said he was going to assemble a group of friends to dress as a “basket of deplorables,” a reference to Clinton’s infamous put-down during a fundraiser of some Trump supporters. West, 43, latched onto the idea “because that word, that phrase, ‘basket of deplorables’ has been flying around so much.” More traditional election-related costumes were also popular ahead of the fancy dress parties and parades planned for the days around Halloween, Oct. 31. Foam Clinton and Trump masks priced at $12.99 were among the top-sellers at Spirit Halloween, according to a spokeswoman for the chain, which specializes in costumes and party supplies. By Wednesday, the Clinton mask had sold out online. Corey Campbell of Virginia said he would shave his beard to mark a briefly famous moment in the campaign. Campbell planned to dress as Ken Bone, the mustachioed, red sweater-wearing audience member who became a social media sensation after he cut into the campaign acrimony to ask an earnest question about energy policy during a town hall presidential debate on Oct. 9. Campbell, who said he was leaning toward voting for Trump, called Bone “a bright moment in this crazy campaign cycle.” “I think the only way you could not have a little campaign fatigue after this cycle is if you haven’t been paying attention.” ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1,2698
Peru and Colombia vow to stand with Mexico after row with Trump,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru and Colombia vowed to stand with Mexico as the country faces an uncertain economic future and grapples with a crisis with the United States just days into U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said members of the Latin American trade bloc the Pacific Alliance must double down on efforts to open markets and strengthen ties as they navigate the “turbulent waters” of protectionist rhetoric. Peru, Colombia, Chile and Mexico formed the Pacific Alliance in 2011 to remove obstacles to trade and orient their markets to the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. “Right now one of us is facing serious difficulties that are not of its own making,” Kuczynski said in reference to Mexico as he sat beside his Colombian counterpart on an official visit. “We have to stand together on our ideals, on global trade which has done us so much good.” Though Kuczynski did not mention Trump by name, his comments were some of the first rumblings of displeasure with the Trump administration from traditional U.S. allies in Latin America. Trump has insisted he will force Mexico to pay for a wall between the two countries to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He has also threatened to slap taxes on Mexican imports and tear up the regional trade deal NAFTA if he cannot renegotiate it to ensure more benefits for the United States. The Mexican peso has been rocked by tensions between the two countries, firming on Friday after Trump said he had a friendly phone call with Mexican President Pena Nieto. “There are clouds of uncertainty around the world,” Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said. “We want to join the call of countries that adhere to the principles that have been so good for the world: free trade, respect for treaties... multilateral solutions.” Santos said he spoke with Pena Nieto by phone on Thursday, when the Mexican leader announced he canceled a meeting with Trump as a diplomatic crisis over the proposed wall deepened. Kuczynski, a former investment banker who spent years living in the United States, said the four countries in the Pacific Alliance represent a market of some 200 million people and that each has emerged from economic crisis in the past by opening markets to global trade. “Of course there are costs to global trade, of course there are job losses, but it’s also clear that the benefits are bigger,” Kuczynski said.

Exiled Egypt presidential hopeful plans return in coming weeks: family,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi s strongest potential challenger in the country s 2018 election plans to return from exile in the coming weeks, his daughter said on Friday. Ahmed Shafik, a former air force commander and government minister, said this week he intended to run for president in a surprise announcement from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he is based. Shafik s daughter May Shafik told Reuters on Friday he was preparing to depart, first for Europe and the United States.  Then he will head back to Egypt to start his presidential campaign,  she said. Shafik had been prevented from leaving the UAE in previous days but had now received assurances that he could travel freely, she said, without specifying who gave the assurances. The UAE denied placing any movement restrictions on Shafik, after a video of him aired by Qatari-owned TV channel Al Jazeera said he had been barred from travel. May Shafik said there had been no intention to release that video, and that it had been leaked to Al Jazeera. The video was filmed as a precaution, she said. The UAE is an ally of Sisi s government, which has been officially silent on Shafik s candidacy announcement. Several Egyptian TV pundits, however, came out against Shafik in a sign of opposition he is likely to face from state-linked media. Shafik is the most serious potential challenger yet to Sisi, who is widely expected to seek a second term, although he has not yet announced he will run. Sisi as a military commander led the ousting of former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, before his own landslide election a year later. Sisi s supporters see him as key to stability following prolonged, violent upheaval that followed the 2011 Egyptian revolt that toppled president Hosni Mubarak.

" Alt-Right Trump Lover Loses His Sh*t, Kills His Own Dad For Calling Him A Nazi","You might never suspect that up here in beautiful Washington State, we have one of the largest numbers of white supremacist groups in America. After all, it s gorgeous and relatively quiet, and this is a  blue  state, right? But under all of our fall colors, our lakes, our bike lanes, and our farmer s markets is the same hate you see in the Deep South or the rural Midwest or really anywhere in the United States.In fact, here in the northwest part of the Northwest, there are a surprising number of  Alt-Right  adherents. But considering how rural much of the area between Seattle and Canada is, nobody should be surprised at how many Trump supporters there are. And that seems to have been the catalyst for many people in my neck of the woods who at one time were relatively self-policing: Permission from the president to be bigots. If you listen to Donald Trump when the conversation moves to white nationalism, the subtext is almost that bigotry makes you more American, and we have got some flag wavers in these parts.So last month when my local paper covered a local murder that was, at least peripherally, connected to the Alt-Right, it really wasn t shocking to me. My (now-adult) son and I have attended any number of rallies up and down the freeway corridor we live on, and there is a strong presence of Richard Spencer wannabes and Milo Yiannopoulos sycophants at every single one. But over the fold was a face I knew: Lane Davis, a 33-year-old guy who lived a few doors down from my mom s old house. I saw him in stores and on the street. I bummed him a smoke outside the Safeway more than once.I touched that guy s hand.Image via FacebookHe killed his dad out on Samish Island, an island that s only actually an island because of a river that crosses the farmland you have have to drive through to get out there. You don t think about white supremacists on your way to Samish Island. I didn t anyway. I thought about my niece s wedding and my grandpa s funeral, both held at the Samish Island Community Center. I think about the herons and red-tailed hawks that hang out in those fields. I think about my mom sometimes. She s a Trump supporter and a bigot, but she wouldn t stab anyone like Lane Davis did.Davis worked for Milo for a little while, and he went by the online name  Seattle4Truth,  under which he posted to Reddit, his YouTube channel, and later, a super-mega-extremely-far-right website,  The Ralph Retort  (which I just won t link, so get to googling if that s your thing). And really, the link at the beginning of the last paragraph has a pretty in-depth profile of his various exploits, after The Daily Beast got their hands on the 911 call his mother made that fateful day.But it s incomplete. This is a small place, and it s personal. The judge who signed off on Davis  probable cause affidavit was the same man who gave me custody of my son. My friends are friends with Lane Davis  friends. I guarantee without texting her to ask her that the saleswoman who used to sell furniture for me knew Lane Davis personally and had possibly been to his house. When I tell you about the little place I live in, and how I casually handed out smokes to an eventual murderer, and the geography and wildlife near where that murderer lived, what I want you to do is go back to the words in bold letters a few paragraphs ago.Before Donald Trump, the white nationalists, racists, skinheads, Klan members, and just generally hateful people around here might have said something racist in public once. Maybe they had  No Trespassing  signs all over their deep-woods properties 20 miles up the Skagit River. Maybe they sported  III%  or  Prius Repellent  stickers on their giant trucks with the smokestacks tuned to blast creosote every time they leave a stoplight.Now they kill their dad because he called them a Nazi and tried to kick them out of the house when he got sick of their bullshit.Heck, Lane Davis isn t even the first murderer I ve ever known. I used to play D&D when I was a kid with a dude who killed another guy after a party back in the early 90 s. But that guy, by the time we were teens, we knew he was going to end up in prison. He was disturbed. He was morbid. He was violent.Lane Davis was just a racist until Donald Trump came along.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 25, 2017",0,4386
"Trump's net worth dwindled to $3.5 billion, Forbes says","NEW YORK (Reuters) - While Donald Trump’s political fortunes were rising, his net worth was dropping to a mere $3.5 billion, or roughly a third of what he claimed during his successful campaign for the U.S. presidency, according to the latest Forbes list of the world’s billionaires.  Trump tumbled more than 100 spots to No. 544 on the magazine’s 31st annual list, largely because of the impact of the slumping New York real estate market on his holdings.  “Midtown Manhattan real estate is down; therefore, so is Donald Trump’s fortune,” the business magazine said in a statement. The developer-turned-politician, who ranked No. 205 last year, fell further behind to Bill Gates, the list’s perennial leader.  Gates, the philanthropic co-founder of Microsoft Corp, was followed this year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett at No. 2 and Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos at No. 3. While Trump’s net worth slipped, more people were qualifying for the list. This year Forbes ranked a record 2,043 billionaires. “Booming stock markets, higher commodities prices and plain old-fashioned entrepreneurship helped make this a record year in terms of wealth creation around the globe,” Forbes editors Luisa Kroll and Kerry Dolan said. Trump’s current $3.5 billion net worth compares with $3.7 billion in October, when Forbes published its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans and a month before his Election Day upset against Democrat Hillary Clinton. While campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in May, Trump’s team filed a personal financial disclosure form that said his net worth was more than $10 billion.  Critics have said he has inflated the true value of his wealth, saying his tax returns would provide a more accurate snapshot of his financial status. But Trump has defied convention and refused to release his returns. Neither the White House nor the Trump Organization, which Trump’s sons have run since their father’s inauguration, immediately responded to a request for comment on the Forbes list.   Gates maintained his No. 1 spot for the fourth year in a row, with his $86 billion fortune up from last year’s $75 billion.  Buffett, the legendary value investor known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” reclaimed the No. 2 berth after a two-year hiatus. His net worth surged to $75.6 billion from $60.8 billion.  Third place went to Bezos, who apparently was the biggest winner on the 2017 list. His wealth jumped to $72.8 billion, a gain of $27.6 billion from last year, Forbes said.

Republican senators start attack on U.S. consumer financial watchdog,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans lawmakers are starting to put in motion plans to destroy or defang the U.S. agency intended to protect individuals from financial fraud. On Tuesday, two Texas Republicans, Senator Ted Cruz and Representative John Ratcliffe, introduced a one-page bill to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau entirely.  Their move comes a few days after Representative Jed Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, outlined a plan to limit the independent agency’s power and to crimp its funding via Congress’ budget process. The agency focuses on financial products such as mortgages and student loans. Next up: David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, will introduce a bill to make the CFPB more accountable to Congress by changing its funding mechanism, according to an aide. Unlike a complete elimination of the agency, which would require 60 votes, Perdue’s bill could be affixed to budget legislation that could become law with a 51-vote majority vote in the Senate. Senate Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown, the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, have vowed to block changes they say would weaken the CFPB’s independence.  Killing the agency altogether would be a hard sell, and even some banking lobbyists have said they would be comfortable with a more restricted CFPB. The agency, which is also facing a court test, was created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Its sole director, currently Richard Cordray, serves a fixed term and its budget flows through the Federal Reserve without being subject to congressional review. Republicans criticizing the CFPB say it overreaches its authority, pushes unnecessary regulation on small banks and uses large fines to direct lenders’ behavior without going through proper rule-making processes. Perdue has also struck at the agency more specifically, introducing a resolution to repeal a new CFPB regulation requiring prepaid cards to disclose their terms prominently. Hensarling’s plan, which anti-CFPB lobbyists and congressional staffers are positing as a compromise, would push some CFPB powers to other agencies while making its budget subject to congressional review and its director a political appointee. Others want to see the agency become a five-member bipartisan commission. President Donald Trump, also a Republican, was elected partly on promises to lighten regulation and is expected to sign any CFPB-related legislation that reaches his desk.

Philippines' Duterte to seek one-year extension of Mindanao martial law,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte will ask Congress to extend martial law in the volatile southern island of Mindanao to quell an insurgency, cabinet officials said on Sunday. Duterte placed the restive region of 22 million people under military rule on May 23 after Islamist militants took over parts of the southern Marawi City in what was the Philippines  biggest security crisis in years. Martial law is due to expire on Dec. 31. The Philippine leader will formally request on Monday a one-year extension of martial law, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea told reporters. The 23-member Senate and the 296-member House of Representatives will vote once they convene in joint session. Lawmakers are due to go on recess on from Dec. 16 to Jan. 14, 2018. Military rule should be extended in Mindanao given threats from Maoist guerrillas, Islamist militants and separatist groups, Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said. Militants linked to Islamic State, which tried to gain a foothold in Southeast Asia by capturing parts of Marawi City, are strengthening their recruitment programs, Andanar said.  There were intelligence reports saying they are planning to attack another city,  Andanar told a radio interview. The request comes nearly two months after Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi City. More than 1,100 people - mostly militants - were killed and 350,000 displaced by the Marawi unrest. Continuing martial law beyond the initial 60-day limit requires lawmakers  approval, but the constitution does not restrict how long it can be extended. ",worldnews,"December 10, 2017 ",1,1674
 Trump Cancels Trip To Israeli Historic Site After Authorities Say He Can’t Land His Helicopter On It,"In yet another example of Trump s inability to maintain even a slight bit of tact while representing America s interests overseas, the White House reportedly canceled plans to visit a historic landmark during his visit to Israel   one of the nation s biggest tourist attractions. The reason: Trump wanted to land his helicopter directly on the ancient mountain fortress and was told no.President Donald Trump has canceled a planned visit and speech at the ancient mountain fortress of Masada in Israel after authorities told him that he could not land his helicopter on top of the UNESCO-listed site.Instead, Trump will now deliver a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. It comes after an Israeli Air Force (IAF) regulation that prevents helicopters landing at the summit of the Masada site, according to Israel s Channel 2 broadcaster.Unlike former presidents who have made the trip, such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Trump declined to land the helicopter at a base of the historic site and then take the cable car up, preferring to cancel the visit altogether.The reasons not allowing helicopters near the 2,000-year-old ruins should be obvious: For starters, the dust and sand that characterize the mountaintop are extremely rough on helicopter motors. Secondly, the wind and sand kicked up by the powerful blades can destroy the ancient structures, costing archaeologists priceless artifacts. Avoiding those issues by simply getting in a cable car was apparently too much energy.It may be another sign that Trump is hoping to breeze past this trip while doing minimal work. Sources close to Trump say he is extremely upset about having to travel abroad for a multi-day trip to the Middle East and already begged his staff to cut the number of days he d be gone. Keen observers of Trump s habits might note that Trump will be missing at least two weekends during the trip, days he typically reserves for golfing at his various private courses.Trump s demands on his overseas guests have raised eyebrows before. Earlier this year, Trump created a stir in England when reports leaked that he had requested Queen Elizabeth pick him up in a golden chariot:The White House has made clear it regards the carriage procession down the Mall as an essential element of the itinerary for the visit currently planned for the second week of October, according to officials.The request frustrated royal planners who described the situation as a logistical and financial nightmare.It s unclear how Israelis will react to Trump s show of laziness during his trip. Already the country s mood toward Trump is souring after the president is said to have leaked classified information provided by Israeli intelligence services to the Russians. He hasn t even left the White House and already his trip is shaping up to be trouble.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2017",0,2968

China's internet regulator denounces its former chief now under investigation,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s internet regulator had said it will purge the  evil influence  of its former top official who the ruling Communist Party has put under investigation for suspected corruption. The official, Lu Wei, was suspected of serious discipline breaches, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) announced on Tuesday.  Lu, a colorful and often brash official by Chinese standards, was at the height of his power seen as emblematic of China s increasingly pervasive internet controls. The Communist Party referred to him as the  first tiger  taken down after a congress in October, when President Xi Jinping pledged that his anti-graft campaign would continue to target both  tigers  and  flies , a reference to elite officials and ordinary bureaucrats. Lu s former agency, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), held a meeting on Wednesday in which it called its former chief  a typical two-faced person  who had  seriously polluted  its political environment.  Lu Wei cannot represent CAC s image. He precisely undermined CAC s image,  the agency said in statement published late on Wednesday. The CAC would  draw profound lessons  from Lu s breaches and  thoroughly purge Lu s evil influence , it said. The CCDI said in a separate commentary on its website on Thursday that the investigation of Lu was a potent sign that the party would not let up on its fight against wayward officials.  One must not think that no one will ask today about yesterday s crimes,  the CCDI said. It was  nonsense  to think the party would  let bygones be bygones , it said. Xi has waged war against deep-rooted corruption since taking office five years ago, punishing hundreds of thousands of officials. Lu worked his way up though China s official Xinhua news agency before becoming head of propaganda in Beijing and then moving to internet work in 2013. He later became a deputy propaganda minister. But his downfall, foreshadowed by his June 2016 replacement as head of the internet regulator and the loss of his other posts, is unlikely to signal a reversal of internet control policies, which have been tightened under his successor, Xu Lin. The government has blocked sites it thinks could challenge party rule or threaten stability, including sites such as Facebook and Google s main search engine and Gmail service.

Obviously some think it s true, while others think it s a bogus smear job. Either way, the thing about it is this: if the rumors really are true, this isn t about what Cruz or anyone else chooses to do in the bedroom. It s about the hypocrisy of going all in on the whole  family values  platform and judging and discriminating against other as a matter of policy and practice. If these religious bigots weren t so high and mighty and self righteous, nobody would care who they choose to crawl into bed with or anything else in their personal lives.

 Khizr Khan EVISCERATES Trump For Disrespectful Purple Heart Comments (VIDEO),"Khizr Khan has been nailing Trump ever since he denounced the Republican nominee s hateful rhetoric at Hillary Clinton s Democratic National Convention last week. Things have only escalated as Trump has repeatedly attacked Khan and his wife, who lost their son, Muslim Army Captain Humayan Khan, while he was fighting for our country.But now that Trump has made some truly heartless, disrespectful comments about receiving a Purple Heart from one of his supporters yesterday, Khan came out in full blast and is more furious than ever that Trump disrespected every veteran by saying,  I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier. In an interview with CNN s Anderson Cooper, Khan shamed Trump and called the acceptance of the medal  heartless.  Khan insisted that Trump  should have pinned that back to that veteran s chest and should have hugged him and thanked him! Khan, making sure that no one forgets that Trump had the chance to serve his country, and he dodged the draft instead, said: You had your chance. You escaped. You dodged the draft and now you want an  easy  Purple Heart in your pocket? You should have pinned it back. Even now, call that man. I want his surrogates to call that man, thank him and put that Purple Heart back on that person s chest. He wants to be the leader, commander-in-chief of this United States of America? That is the thoughtfulness? He should have put that Purple Heart back. If he would have been sensible he would have known what it takes to earn that Purple Heart. In fact, Trump had five deferments so that he could avoid serving his country, yet he thinks he is worthy of accepting a veteran s Purple Heart?

DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER Puts Forth Bill Requiring Wife’s Permission For Men To Obtain Viagra Prescription,"Leave it to a Democrat to waste everyone s time and money by putting forth legislation she knows has no chance of passing, as a means to convince legislators they need to make it easier to kill an unborn child. A Kentucky lawmaker has put forward a bill that would require men to visit a doctor at least twice and obtain a signed permission slip from their wives before they could obtain a prescription for the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.State Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat, acknowledged to the Louisville Courier-Journal that the bill has no chance of passing. However, she said the bill was a response to several anti-abortion measures, including a recently ratified law that requires a woman seeking an abortion to get counseling at least 24 hours in advance from a health professional.In an opinion piece, Marzian said her bill is meant to  illustrate the absurdity of government encroachment into women s personal and medical decisions currently running amok in the Kentucky General Assembly and [Gov. Matt] Bevin administration. Marzian s bill specifies that only married men can obtain Viagra and a prospective patient must  make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse. Other state lawmakers have filed similar bills to make political points. In 2012, a bill from an Ohio state senator required men to get a psychological evaluation before getting a Viagra prescription and last year a South Carolina state representative filed a bill that would require men to wait 24 hours before getting a prescription.Marzian has also said she would file a bill requiring potential gun buyers to undergo counseling from victims of gun violence 24 hours in advance of the purchase.

 Trump Whines About Unfair Media During Coast Guard Commencement Address (VIDEO),"Amateur president Donald Trump used his commencement speech at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday to make the day all about him. Trump did not address the scandals which have inundated the White House directly, but indirectly he did by saying that he s receiving unfair treatment by the media. Even though Trump s scandals have been compared to Watergate, he said,  Look at the way I ve been treated lately. Especially by the media. Trump whined that no politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly. Apparently, the former reality show star has forgotten how he treated Barack Obama, dogging our first black president for years with baseless allegations saying that he s a scary Muslim from Kenya.Trump gave the cadets some advice, saying that they will need to  fight, fight, fight. Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted,  he said, seemingly referring to bombshell reports, which he even admitted to on Twitter, saying he disclosed highly classified information to top Russian officials. Or he could be referring to the other bombshell reports, stating that he asked former FBI Director James Comey to shut down an investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.Trump went on to brag that he s  accomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time. Then he boasted of his upcoming first international trip which is to begin on Friday. As you leave this academy to embark on your exciting new voyage,  Trump said,  I am heading on a very crucial journey, as well. In a few days, I will make my first trip abroad as President. Things will work out just fine,  Trump concluded.  Great honor. Good luck. Enjoy your life. Watch:Poor Trump, the media has treated him so unfairly by quoting him verbatim. When Flynn was forced to resign, he called the disgraced retired General a  wonderful  man then went on to blame the  fake media. Tell me if this sounds familiar. Michael Flynn, Gen. Flynn, is a wonderful man. I think he has been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media in many cases,  Trump said at the time.

BREAKING! INVESTIGATION: Hillary Clinton Did NOT Comply With Records Rules," Was Hillary Clinton negligent or was she doing this on purpose? Either way, it s a really bad situation and gives more fodder for the Trump campaign. Keep at it!The State Department inspector general concluded that Hillary Clinton did not comply with the agency s policies on records, according to a report released to lawmakers on Wednesday that also revealed that Clinton and her top aides chose not to cooperate with the review.The agency on Wednesday released the long-awaited report to Capitol Hill, copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, providing just the latest turn in the headache-inducing saga that has dogged Clinton s campaign.While the report concludes that the agency suffers from  longstanding, systemic weaknesses  with records that  go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State,  it specifically dings Clinton for her exclusive use of private email.The watchdog s findings could exact further damage to Clinton s campaign, and they provide fresh fodder for Trump, who has already said he will go after Clinton for the email scandal  bigly.  The Democratic frontrunner s bid for the White House has already been hindered by high unfavorability ratings, with people saying they don t trust her. The report represents the latest pushback   in this case by a nonpartisan government entity   against her campaign s claim that she did not break any rules and that her use of a private server was completely allowed. The report also details how some technology staff said they were instructed to not talk of Clinton s email set-up after they raised concerns about the unusual arrangement. It also includes conflicting information about whether the private email server had been approved by the State Department s legal staff. Read more: POLITICO",Government News,"May 25, 2016",0,1843

Before colliding with vehicles arranged by FBI and Oregon State Police troopers, the SUV swerves to the left to go around the road block but is quickly thwarted by the accumulated snow. A man, presumably Finicum, emerges from the car with his arms outstretched.Officials begin to approach the man when he appears to reach into his coat and pulls out an object resembling a handgun. The FBI reported that the handgun was a 9mm semi-automatic firearm, carried in Finicum s left jacket pocket.It s at this point when we see the man fall limply into the snow, fatally wounded by one or more Oregon State Police officers.The official description of the incident from the FBI s Greg Bretzing:As the white truck approaches the roadblock, there is a spike strip across the road but it appears Finicum missed it as he attempted to drive around the roadblock. He nearly hits an FBI agent as he maneuvers to the left. The truck gets stuck in the snowbank.Finicum leaves the truck and steps through the snow. Agents and troopers on scene had information that Finicum and others would be armed. On at least two occasions, Finicum reaches his right hand toward a pocket on the left inside portion of his jacket. He did have a loaded 9 mm semi-automatic handgun in that pocket.At this time, OSP troopers shot Finicum.The video debunks claims by the Oregon militia that Finicum was surrendering to police on his knees.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGxDWKrjPQ&w=420&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 28, 2016",0,2062
"MI BOARD OF EDUCATION Will Allow Students To Choose Gender, Bathroom, Locker Room And Even A New Name With No Parental Consent","Every parent in the United States of America should be alarmed by this covert attempt by Board of Education members to essentially tell our kids that their power supersedes that of the parents. Furthermore, this reckless policy of placing same sex kids in bathrooms and locker rooms puts children in danger of being in private spaces with sexual predators and or sexual offenders Make sure to add your comments to the MI Board of Educations HEREMichigan s State Board of Education has drafted a guidance that would push the state s schools to allow all students, regardless of parental or doctoral input, to choose their gender, name, pronouns, and bathrooms.Spearheaded by board president John C. Austin and signed by state superintendent Brian Whiston, the guidance informs Michigan public schools that only the students themselves i.e. not their parents or doctors can determine what their individual gender identities are. The responsibility for determining a student s gender identity rests with the student. Outside confirmation from medical or mental health professionals, or documentation of legal changes, is not needed,  the guidance states.Gender identity is defined in the guidance as  a person s deeply held internal sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, regardless of the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Notably, the guidance makes no mention of a student s age affecting whether or not they can pick a gender without their parent or doctor.In fact, the guidance seems to intentionally cut parents out of the process.The guidance states:  School staff should address students by their chosen name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, regardless of whether there has been a legal name change. Students can even ask to have their chosen name and gender  included in the district s information management systems, in addition to the student s legal name. But what about when school staff members are speaking with parents about their son or daughter?The guidance states that  Transgender and GNC [gender nonconforming] students have the right to decide when, with whom, and to what extent to share private information. Accordingly, the board makes clear,  When contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender or GNC student, school staff should use the student s legal name and the pronoun corresponding to the student s assigned sex at birth, unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise. In other words, a boy named  Jake  could become a girl named  Jane  at school, seemingly without his parents ever knowing.Names, pronouns, and genders aren t the only things the board wants students to choose.The guidance informs schools that  Students should be allowed to use the restroom in accordance with their gender identity. And the board makes clear that single-stall bathrooms are not inclusive enough:  Alternative and non-stigmatizing options, such as an all-gender or singleuser restroom (e.g., staff bathroom or nurse s office), should be made available to students who request them, but not presented as the only option. Locker rooms also should become inclusive of students  many gender identities.  A student should not be required to use a locker room that is incongruent with their gender identity,  the guidance states.  Locker room usage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the guiding principles of safety and honoring the student s gender identity and expression. Students who are bothered by having members of the opposite sex in their locker rooms can request  an adjusted changing schedule  or  use of a private area in the facility. The board quietly issued the statement and guidance on February 23rd, without a press release. The public has only until April 11th to comment on the proposed guidance, according to the Department of Education website. The board will finalize the guidance at a meeting on May 10th.

 WATCH: Stephen Colbert Takes Republicans To The Woodshed For Voting Against Gun Control Bills,"Stephen Colbert was so angry at Senate Republicans that he crushed them into dust during his show on Tuesday night.On Monday, Senate Republicans had the opportunity to join Democrats and pass gun laws designed to prevent suspected terrorists from legally purchasing assault weapons in this country to kill Americans with.Instead, the NRA puppets obeyed their masters and ignored the will of the American people by voting the bills down, which means potential terrorists like Omar Mateen will still be able to buy guns for future mass shootings.And that didn t sit well with Colbert, who wasted no time ripping Republicans to shreds. We all have jobs to do,  Colbert said.  I m doing my job right now and I ve got these cameras here to prove it. After the attacks in Orlando, I thought, maybe the government might do their job and pass any kind of law. Even a fig leaf to justify their existence. They couldn t even agree to keep people on the terror watch list from buying high-powered assault rifles. I don t understand you, Senate. Ninety-two percent of Americans want you to expand background checks for gun buyers and you just ignore them! Since when does 8 percent of the population get to have total control over an issue? That s like taking your entire family on a cross-country car trip and letting grandma choose all the music! Colbert then took the gloves off and continued smacking down Senate Republicans with a series of devastating jokes that should make every American so embarrassed that Republicans control Congress that they will do something to reverse that in November. Hey, Senate, my dog accomplished more than you this week when it rolled over and licked its nuts,  Colbert said, with a beat-track playing behind him. Hey, Senate, I ve seen bugs trapped in amber move faster than you! You guys think the terrorist watch list is when you put  Homeland  on your Netflix que. You might as well ask the gun lobby to check for a hernia as long as they ve got your balls in their hands. Senate, you couldn t pass a bill if it was coated in Ex-Lax. But if you ever did pass a bill it would say,  Be it resolved, no kissing and the NRA should just leave the money on the dresser. Senate, you accomplish so little that Kylie Jenner wants to know what you do for a living. Senate, you got more old white men lying around than a Life Alert ad. You re so divided, you couldn t come together if you had 30 hours and a reach-around from Sting. You re like a grandpa after an all-starch dinner, you cannot get sh*t done. Here s the video via YouTube:Senate Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. They were sent to Washington to protect and work for the American people, not the NRA. Clearly, they are incapable of doing anything substantial to protect the lives of Americans because the NRA owns them and would rather they insist that merely saying the words  radical Islamic terrorism  is enough. Republicans are not fit to be public servants. 150 years after the GOP ended slavery they ve become nothing more than slaves themselves on a plantation run by the National Rifle Association. And that is a threat to the lives of every man, woman, and child in this country.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"June 22, 2016",0,3304
"U.S. military can withstand the sage grouse, lawmakers say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to protect the greater sage grouse, a bird found in the western United States, do not pose a threat to the U.S. military, two senior Democratic House of Representatives lawmakers said on Tuesday. Debate over the bird was intense a year ago when the House Armed Services Committee was finalizing its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the $600 billion  annual bill setting out U.S. defense policy. Arguing that protecting the sage grouse would put large swaths of the western United States off limits for military training, House Republicans included a ban on making the bird an endangered species in the House version of the 2016 NDAA. The measure was stripped out as the bill was considered by the Senate and not in the legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama. But it is again in the House version of the 2017 NDAA, which the House armed services panel will debate on Wednesday. Representatives Adam Smith, the top Armed Services Democrat, and Raul Grijalva, his counterpart on the Natural Resources Committee, released letters from Department of Defense officials saying that land use plans intended to protect the bird will not affect military training, operations or readiness to any significant degree. “These letters put to bed once and for all the silly speculation that a few birds could hamstring the greatest fighting force in the history of the world,” Grijalva said in a statement.

Germany's SPD not available for government after talks fail,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Social Democrats are still not available to join Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats in a continuation of their  grand coalition  government after talks with other parties failed, a party document showed on Monday.  Given the results of the Sept. 24 election, we are not available for entry into a grand coalition,  read a SPD paper due to be discussed by party leaders that was obtained by Reuters.  We are not afraid of new elections.  The comments came after Merkel s efforts to form a three-way coalition government failed, pitching Germany into its worse political crisis for decades, raising the prospect of fresh elections and casting doubt over her future. The SPD won just 20.5 percent in the September election, its worst post-war result after it lost stature as junior partner in the often awkward coalition dominated by Merkel.

"Factbox: Japanese emperor Akihito worked to console the people, reconcile with Asia","TOKYO (Reuters) - A special panel to debate the timing of Emperor Akihito s abdication, Japan s first in nearly two centuries, meets on Friday, setting the stage for a formal decision by the government. Akihito, who turns 84 on Dec. 23 and has had heart surgery and been treated for prostate cancer, said last year he feared age might make it hard to fulfill his duties. Following are some highlights from Akihito s career as the first emperor not to be considered divine from the time he ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne in 1989.  MIDDLE-CLASS MONARCHY    Akihito s 1959 marriage to Michiko Shoda, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, was the first by an emperor to a commoner and was hailed as a symbol of a new Japan. The two courted at a tennis club and he won her promise to marry him over the phone. They worked to craft an image of a  middle-class monarchy   in an attempt to draw the imperial family closer to the people.  All three of their children went to university and married commoners, and the public was informed when Akihito was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002 - in contrast to the secrecy around Emperor Hirohito s ultimately fatal illness. Akihito and Michiko have worked to smooth relations across Asia, which suffered from Japan s aggression before and during World War Two, with numerous visits abroad. In 1992, he became the first Japanese monarch in living memory to visit China, where bitter memories of the war run deep, and  deeply deplored  an  unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great suffering on the people of China . At a news conference marking his birthday in 2001, he said he felt  a certain kinship  with Korea because one of his ancestors had come from there, an unprecedented statement from a Japanese royal that made front page headlines in Seoul. In 2005, the couple went to the island of Saipan, the scene of bloody fighting during World War Two, to pay respects at memorials honoring Japanese, American and Korean war dead.  Akihito has often urged Japan to remember the suffering of the war, comments that have attracted increased attention in recent years, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appears to be pushing for a less apologetic tone towards Japan s past. On Aug. 15, 2015, the 70th anniversary of the war s end, Akihito departed from his annual script to express  deep remorse . The day before, Abe had expressed  utmost grief  but said future generations should not have to keep apologizing. One of the duties the royal couple has taken most seriously has been comforting victims of disasters. Akihito has knelt to talk to evacuees and Michiko has hugged women who lost their homes. In 2011, Akihito took the unprecedented step of addressing the nation in a televised speech after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that triggered the world s worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.  He again turned to television in 2016 to tell the people he feared he was getting too old to carry out his duties, implying he wished to abdicate. ",worldnews,"December 1, 2017 ",1,3093
Window closing for Republican stealth assault on U.S. regulations,"WASHINGTON The clock began running out this week on a strategy that has provided U.S. Republicans in Congress with their only notable legislative successes this year: aggressive use of an obscure U.S. law known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA).  On his 75th day in power, President Donald Trump has yet to offer any major legislation or win passage of a bill he favors, but House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has notched numerous small-scale victories with his strategy.  Vice President Mike Pence told business leaders at the White House on Tuesday that Trump would sign more CRA resolutions soon and roll back an “avalanche of red tape” from the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  REUTERS COMMENTARYWar College: One tank to rule them allThe right way to address the Marines United Facebook GroupIn legal battles against travel ban, Trump's own statements are his worst enemy Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions under the CRA killing Obama-era regulations, most of concern to business interests.  Trump has signed 11 of these into law, not only rolling back the rules they targeted but also barring agencies from writing “substantially similar” regulations in the future.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday the number of resolutions signed over two months showed Trump is “vastly different” from past presidents in rolling back regulations.  On Monday Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams.  Last Friday was the deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted by Obama’s administration. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline by mid-May.  Democrats assail the reversals as harming the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the regulations were killed in order to please big-money lobbyists.  Representative Louise Slaughter, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee that sends resolutions to the House floor for votes, said in an interview “of course it benefits the lobbyists.”  But she said fumbles around healthcare and tax reform also pushed CRA resolutions to the fore.  “Partly I think it’s because they don’t have anything else to do,” she said about Republicans’ eagerness. “Other than that I think it’s just another ‘take that Obama.’”  McCarthy, a Californian and the No. 2 House Republican, saw the CRA’s potential before the election. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the law was originally meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers recognized it could be used as a policy weapon, if the stars aligned.  Under the law, resolutions only need simple majorities in each chamber to go on for the president’s signature. So one party must control both the legislative and executive branches for it to work. The law sets a short time span for introducing disapproval resolutions: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used right after a president of an opposing party leaves office.  The stars aligned on Nov. 8, when Republicans captured the White House, Senate and House. For weeks Republican lawmakers bombarded McCarthy with lists of regulations to repeal and lobbying groups laid plans. The first disapproval resolutions were introduced on Jan. 30.  Right after the election, McCarthy told his party to “go through each regulation on our priority list,” he said.  “If you look at Article One of the Constitution, this isn’t the role of these agencies. The agencies have become too big,” McCarthy said in an interview with Reuters.  The first resolutions sailed through, primarily because Republicans had opposed the regulations long before they were finalized. McCarthy said so many lawmakers objected to the stream pollution rule that wiping it off the books was easy.  Even though the CRA effort is winding down, McCarthy’s brief campaign showed that aggressive use of the law could succeed, and provided Republicans with some modest, but needed successes in a time when they are struggling with larger matters.  “After years of talk about cutting red tape, it is now actually happening,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday. “We are reversing the Obama administration’s most recent and last regulatory onslaught.”  ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2017 ",1,4678
"After ditching Taiwan, China says Panama will get the help it needs","BEIJING (Reuters) - China will provide Panama with whatever help it needs after the Central American country ditched long-standing ties with self-ruled Taiwan in June, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Friday after talks between the two countries  presidents. Panama s decision to end ties with Taiwan was a major victory for Beijing, as it lures away the dwindling number of countries that have formal relations with the island China claims as its own. Taiwan s government said at the time it was sorry and angry over the decision, and it would not compete with China in what it described as a  diplomatic money game . Speaking to reporters after Chinese President Xi Jinping and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela signed 19 deals, including a feasibility study on a free trade agreement, Zhao Bentang, who heads the Chinese foreign ministry s Latin America department, said their ties were not based on money.  China and Panama establishing ties is a political decision made by both sides on the basis of political principles and looking at long term benefits. There were no economic or financial strings attached,  Zhao said.   If our Panamanian friends need, in the spirit of friendship and South-South cooperation the Chinese side is willing to assist Panama s economic and social development to the best of our capacity.  China and Taiwan have tried to poach each other s allies for years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, though Taipei now struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful Beijing. Beijing says Taiwan has no right to diplomatic recognition because it is part of China. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan at the end of China s civil war in 1949. Varela told Chinese state television in September the decision to switch recognition to China had nothing to do with  chequebook diplomacy . Xi said Varela had shown strategic vision and political courage in recognizing China and that China wanted to draw up a  fine blueprint  for the development of relations.   This sends an important message to the world, which is that a brand new page has been opened in China-Panama relations,  Xi told Varela in Beijing s Great Hall of the People.  The development of ties has been delayed for many years, but that history has passed,  Xi added. Last month, a group including China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) began building a $165 million port in Panama for cruise ships, the first project announced between China and Panama since they established diplomatic ties. China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who it thinks wants to push for the island s formal independence, although she says she wants to maintain peace with Beijing.

AIRPORT PASSENGER “PAT DOWNS” Get More Intrusive With New Full-Body Groping Procedures,"One woman s awful experience at the airport could soon be what we all go through to travel by air. This is the day of terrorism where Islamists will do pretty much anything to hide explosives or a weapon so we now have to endure a very  intimate  examination in order to keep us all safe when flying. The new procedure was put in place a month ago-Please see the specifics below.Do you have a story to tell? We d like to hear it. Here s Jenna s story below:Jenna MacFarlane was on the way to visit a friend in Baltimore in April when her carry-on bag triggered an alarm at Charlotte s airport.A Transportation Security Administration screener told MacFarlane she would have to undergo a full-body pat-down by a female officer. Late for her flight and with no option other than to be searched in private, MacFarlane agreed.The pat-down, done over her clothes, explored her breasts, crotch and buttocks. I did not imagine that she would ask me a few times to spread my legs wider and in fact touch my vagina four times with the side of her hand,  MacFarlane later wrote in a complaint to the TSA.Just a month before her search, TSA had launched a new,  more involved  pat-down procedure:Pat-down procedures are used to determine whether prohibited items or other threats to transportation security are concealed on the person. You may be required to undergo a pat-down procedure if the screening technology alarms, as part of random or unpredictable security measures, for enhanced screening, or as an alternative to other types of screening, such as advanced imaging technology screening. Even passengers who normally receive expedited screening, such as TSA Pre  passengers, may at times receive a pat-down.A pat-down may include inspection of the head, neck, arms, torso, legs, and feet. This includes head coverings and sensitive areas such as breasts, groin, and the buttocks. You may be required to adjust clothing during the pat-down. The officer will advise you of the procedure to help you anticipate any actions before you feel them. Pat-downs require sufficient pressure to ensure detection, and areas may undergo a pat-down more than once for the TSA officer to confirm no threat items are detected.TSA officers use the back of the hands for pat-downs over sensitive areas of the body. In limited cases, additional screening involving a sensitive area pat-down with the front of the hand may be needed to determine that a threat does not exist.You will receive a pat-down by an officer of the same gender. TSA officers will explain the procedures to you as they conduct the pat-down. Please inform an officer if you have difficulty raising your arms or remaining in the position required; an external medical device; or areas of the body that are painful when touched. You may request a chair to sit if needed.At any time during the process, you may request private screening accompanied by a companion of your choice. A second officer of the same gender will always be present during private screening.Read more here: Charlotte Observer",left-news,"Aug 23, 2017",0,3133
ICELAND PROUDLY CLAIMS TO HAVE “ERADICATED” Down Syndrome…In Most Gruesome Way Imaginable,"Mainstream news channels rarely draw attention to the negative side of abortion, but CBS News did so this week with a report about Iceland s near 100-percent abortion rate for babies with Down syndrome.  few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland,  the report begins.  Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women   close to 100 percent   who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy. Just a handful of children with Down syndrome have been born in Iceland in the past decade. Two are born each year, on average, but the rest are killed in the womb. For most of the children who were born, their mothers decided not to have prenatal screening tests.This deadly discrimination against babies with disabilities is a problem in countries across the world, not just Iceland. In 2014, the Danish government reported 98 percent of unborn babies who tested positive for Down syndrome were aborted. CBS reports the rate in France was 77 percent in 2015, 90 percent in the United Kingdom and 67 percent in the U.S. between 1995 and 2011. Some put the rate even higher in the United States, but it is difficult to determine the exact number because the U.S. government does not keep detailed statistics about abortion.In many of these countries, late-term abortions are legal in cases of fetal anomalies, such as Down syndrome. The UK, for example, prohibits abortions after 24 weeks but allows wide exceptions for late-term abortions involving fetal anomalies.Iceland hospital counselor Helga Sol Olafsdottir does not see any problem with the fact that so many women are having their unborn babies aborted because of Down syndrome. This systematic discrimination is simply a  woman s choice  in her mind.The issue is not gray. It s very clearly wrong, says Penny Nace, president and CEO of Concerned Women for America. This is eugenics and barbarianism at best,  Nace said.  These individuals have no less worth than anyone else. Iceland and many other countries are killing human beings in abortions simply because they have a disability. Down syndrome varies in severity, but most people with the genetic disorder live into their 60s. Some even live on their own, hold down jobs, go to college and get married.For entire story   Life News",politics,"Aug 16, 2017",0,2446
U.S. states see favorable conditions for gas tax hikes,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. states where gasoline taxes have not risen in decades are now discussing an increase and conditions might be ripe for the proposed hikes to win approval in state legislatures, tax experts said this week.  Low gas prices, a desperate need for revenue to fix crumbling roads, and a post-election period that gives politicians the space to tackle controversial issues have breathed life into efforts to raise the taxes, said Carl Davis, research director at the non-partisan Washington D.C.-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.  In all, 21 state legislatures will consider bills aimed at increasing gas taxes this year, Davis said. “Some states that have gone 10 or 20 or almost 30 years without a gas tax rate increase, and they’ve seen the purchasing power of their taxes decimated by inflation. Those rates need to be updated,” he said. “There are states that have a lot of catching up to do.”   Chief among those are five politically conservative, traditionally tax-averse states that have not raised their fuel tax rates since the 1980s or earlier. Alaska, Oklahoma, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee – all of which voted for U.S. President Donald Trump in November – are debating gas tax increases in their state legislatures right now.  “As funds and their purchasing power have been depleted over the last few decades, states are coming to realize they have to raise revenues to maintain the transportation assets they have,” Kevin Pula, a policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, told Reuters. Alaska has not increased its fuels tax in almost 47 years and has the lowest rate in the nation. But faced with a budget shortfall, Governor Bill Walker, an independent, has proposed tripling fuel tax rates this session.  In Oklahoma, low oil and gas prices have created an estimated $870 million shortfall in the 2018 fiscal year. Republican Governor Mary Fallin in a speech on Monday proposed increasing the gasoline and diesel excise taxes by 7 cents and 10 cents, respectively, to 24 cents per gallon each.  “This increase keeps Oklahoma’s motor fuel tax rates well below the national average of over 29 cents per gallon,” Fallin said.  Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee all have gas tax measures in their state legislatures.  Momentum for gasoline tax increases began in 2012. Since then, 19 states have raised their gas taxes including liberal-leaning blue states Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont and New Jersey. Deep red Wyoming raised its gas tax in 2013, as did fellow conservative states Idaho and Nebraska in 2015.  Even if the states do not pass their gas tax increases this year, they could still eventually become law.  “It’s very unusual at the state level to see a measure proposed and then immediately enacted,” said Joung Lee, an associate director at the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “It usually takes several bites at the apple,” he said.

Iraq says Iran has shut border with Kurdistan,"BAGHDAD/DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Sunday shut its border crossings with Iraq s Kurdistan in support of measures taken by the Iraqi government to isolate the Kurdish region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said.  At the request of the Iraqi government, the Islamic Republic of Iran closed today the border crossings with the Kurdistan region of Iraq,  the Iraqi foreign ministry said in a statement in Baghdad. Earlier in the day, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi had indirectly dismissed claims these crossings were shut.  As far as I know, nothing new has happened in this area,   the Iranian Students  News Agency (ISNA) quoted him as saying. An Iranian MP Mohammad-Javad Nobandegani said Tehran did not want to publicize the closing of the border.   There is no need for explicit publicity,  the MP was quoted as saying by Iran s ILNA news agency. The closure would negatively impact residents who depend on border trade, he said, adding that  national interests sometimes require us to act this way.  Iran last month halted flights to and from Kurdish regions in northern Iraq over the independence referendum by the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Tehran also carried out war games at the Kurdish border in September. Tehran fears the spread of separatism to its own Kurdish population, which is around 8 million. Iran backs Shi ite groups which have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in Iraq since the 2003 U.S-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein.

 Donna Brazile CRUSHES Karl Rove For Making ‘Joke’ About Slavery During Debate,"This is why Republicans lost the black vote and will continue losing it for generations to come.During a closed door meeting of hedge fund managers, the entertainment consisted of GOP political strategist Karl Rove debating former Al Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile. Rove is a white man from Texas who frequently appears on Fox News to argue for conservative points of view. Brazile is a black woman who is currently Vice Chair of the DNC as well as an academic and author.So when Rove decided to  joke  that Brazile should be grateful to him and the Republican Party because she isn t a slave today, it was not only insulting, it resulted in Brazile crushing Rove with historical fact. I did you a great favor bringing you into politics in the 1860 campaign and this is how you repay me?  Rove asked.  We re happy you got the right to vote but it wasn t your current party that was responsible for it. Yeah, you read that right. Rove literally took credit for the abolition movement and claimed that black people owe the Republican Party because of the end of slavery and the passage of the 15th Amendment.Of course, Republicans were liberals at that time and Democrats were the conservatives. Today, it s the opposite and Republicans dominate the South, where racism still flourishes and Confederate history is still celebrated.But Brazile fired back by pointing out that women did not have the right to vote until 1920 and black people did not have their right to vote truly protected until the Voting Right Act of 1965, which the conservative-leaning Supreme Court gutted in 2013, which has led to red states instituting voter suppression laws designed to block black people from exercising their right to vote.And then she really let Karl Rove and the Republican Party have it by blasting them for their hypocrisy and the fact that they have to reach back in time to the 1860s to find an example of something good the party has done. I don t find it strange when Karl Rove brings up Abraham Lincoln because they can t bring up anything else,  Brazile told ThinkProgress.  It s easier for them speak of Lincoln s accomplishments than what they are doing today on voting rights. They don t have a future reference. They have the past. Exactly. Flawless victory.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"June 6, 2016",0,2374

Lawmakers have warned that handling the hot-button issue ahead of next year s elections would reduce the chances of approval. Meirelles said in a radio interview he will tell rating agencies the delay until February does not mean pension reform will not be approved. He told Radio Estad o it would be  reasonable  for the agencies to wait until the bill is voted on before deciding on a potential downgrade. Lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia on Monday said pension reform would be hard to approve if the bill is not passed by February. The first vote was put off last week and scheduled for Feb. 19 after the Christmas-to-Carnival holiday recess. Maia told a news conference there is room to discuss a longer transition period for public sector employees, to include those who started working before 2003. While this would add to future pension costs, Maia said the government will refuse to give up one more penny in fiscal savings. The current version of the bill would save 480 billion reais ($146 billion) over 10 years, according to government estimates, down from 800 billion reais in the original proposal, before concessions were made to try to win passage. Brazil s bloated pension system, which is especially generous for public sector employees, is the main cause of a huge budget deficit that cost Latin America s largest nation its prized investment-grade credit rating two years ago. The finance ministry said Meirelles will hold conference calls with rating agency representatives on Thursday. Investors fear that failure to streamline social security could weaken Brazil s recovery from a deep economic downturn, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates from an all-time low and triggering new sovereign rating downgrades in 2018. Last week, Moody s Investors Service calling the delay in voting on the pension bill  credit negative .  This raises the possibility that the reform will not be approved next year, given political uncertainty surrounding the presidential elections,  Moody s said in a note to clients.

" Russia Drops Bombshell, Confirms It’s Been Talking To Trump Throughout Campaign (DETAILS)","For the entirety of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, there was a massive amount of suspicion surrounding the reality television star s relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin. It turns out that just two days after Trump has gotten elected to be the next President of the United States, most of our instincts were correct.On Thursday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that  there were contacts  between the Trump campaign the Russian embassy staff throughout this election. He said: Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage. Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives. This news comes after we d already seen various instances where Trump embraced and praised Putin during his campaign, giving the impression that these two might actually be best friends. Trump had also said he would improve America s relations with Russia, and told NATO allies  they ll need to pay tribute to the United States if they want to continue to have protection against possible Russian aggression. Trump s relationship with Russia concerned intelligence and foreign policy experts alike   and it should concern all of us as well. Trump has lied about his relationship with Russia   much like he has lied about everything else in his presidential campaign. Trump repeatedly told Americans that he had not been interacting with the Kremlin even in the face of evidence that he was praising Putin. Once again, Ryabkov contradicted Trump s previous denial when he said: We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes. It s also useful to point out that Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign after the New York Times reported that ledgers discovered in Ukraine found that millions of dollars had been earmarked for Trump from the pro-Russian political party of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. If that isn t shady, I don t know what is.Now that the election is over, Trump s lies are being exposed one by one. His followers are going to be devastated when they find out who they really elected.Featured image via Adam Berry and Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,2495
"Catalonia refuses to renounce independence, separatist protesters rally","BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia refused on Tuesday to bow to the Spanish government s demand that it renounce a symbolic declaration of independence, setting it on a political collision course with Madrid later this week. Madrid has threatened to put Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain s economy, under direct central rule if its regional government does not abandon independence by Thursday. But Catalonia s government rejected Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s deadline.  Giving in forms no part of this government s scenarios,  Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull said.  On Thursday, we won t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.  Spain s biggest political crisis in decades worsened on Monday night when Madrid s High Court jailed the heads of Catalonia s two main separatist groups pending an investigation for alleged sedition. The Catalan government accused Madrid of taking  political prisoners  and tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona s Diagonal Avenue to call for their release. People held up lighted candles, whistled and shouted  freedom  and  out with the occupying forces .  There should not be political prisoners in a democratic country in the 21st century. This country is not democratic. I m here to support democracy,  said Alicia Cabreriza, a 26-year-old computer programmer from Barcelona. The protests ended peacefully at around 2000 GMT. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, in a tweet following the detentions, said:  Sadly, we have political prisoners again.  The phrase was an allusion to the military dictatorship under Francisco Franco, when Catalan culture and language were systematically suppressed. It carries an emotional resonance given fascism is still a living memory for many Spaniards. Justice Minister Rafael Catala hit back, saying the jailing of the leaders of the separatist groups, the Catalan National Assembly and Omnium, was a judicial, not a political, decision.  We can talk of politicians in prison but not political prisoners,  he said.  These are not political prisoners because yesterday s prison ruling was due to a (suspected) crime.  The crisis has deepened divisions at the heart of Spain s young democracy, underlining the complex sense of nationhood in the euro zone s fourth largest economy. In Madrid, unionists drape their homes in the national flag, while Barcelona apartment buildings are festooned with Catalan flags. Street protests of hundreds of thousands of people have been held on both sides of the divide, including in Catalonia.  They ve crossed a line,  said Eulalia L pez, a 54-year-old office worker in Barcelona. She said she and her colleagues would come out onto the streets if Madrid went ahead and took control of the region. European capitals and financial markets have looked on with mounting alarm since Oct. 1, when Catalan authorities held a referendum on independence in defiance of a Spanish court ban. ANC leader Jordi Sanchez and Omnium chief Jordi Cuixart are accused by prosecutors of helping to orchestrate pro-independence protests that last month trapped national police inside a Barcelona building and destroyed their vehicles. That same incident also led to Catalonia s police chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, being investigated for sedition. He is accused of failing to order his force to rescue them from the building. He has not been detained but the High Court banned him from leaving Spain and seized his passport. A string of companies, including two major lenders, have decided to move their headquarters outside Catalonia since the referendum. Spanish police launched a violent crackdown in an effort to thwart the referendum, using rubber bullets and batons on voters in scenes that shocked Spain s European neighbors. Catalan officials say 43 percent of voters still managed to cast ballots with 90 percent in favor of breaking away. Many unionists, however, obeyed Madrid and did not vote. Spain s constitutional court, which had suspended the referendum, said on Tuesday the law passed by the Catalan parliament to hold the vote was void because it broke dispositions of Spain s 1978 constitution. One of Catalonia s major foreign investors, Volkswagen, said on Tuesday that its Spanish division, Seat, had decided to delay announcing the name of its forthcoming model. Seat, based in Martorell in Catalonia, had planned to announce the name of its 2018 sport-utility vehicle this month, about a year ahead of the 7-seat model s launch.  With the entire Spanish media focused on politics at the moment, we have decided to find a better time,  a Seat spokesman said, adding the division had also delayed the announcement of an innovation and digitisation agreement. He did not elaborate. ",worldnews,"October 17, 2017 ",1,4811
WIKILEAKS EMAIL: CLINTON FAN BOY Says He “Knows” Trump-Hater Megyn Kelly…Offers To Arrange Softball Interview For Hillary,"For all the hate Democrats openly express for FOX News, it s good to know that Hillary surrogates like Lanny Davis can rely on good Trump-hater Megyn Kelly to prop up Crooked Hillary The latest Wikileaks dump includes an email from Lanny Davis tries to convince Catholic hater Jennifer Palmeiri that it would be a good idea for Megyn Kelly to interview Hillary, giving her a chance to explain the mistake she made withe her private email server. He even offers to arrange a friendly interview for Hillary with Megyn. Here is the text from the email:Dear Jen,I know what I m about to propose is very risky and will be instinctively viewed negatively on the first reaction. But because of the high advantages that I see, perfectly aware of the risks, I think this proposal should be considered.I propose that the Secretary be on the Megyn Kelly File show for at least 30 minutes. I believe I can reduce the risks, since I know Megyn and Roger Ailes very well, by ensuring that the Secretary will have an opportunity to answer tough questions on emails and other issues without interruption. In fact, I believe it is in the interest of Secretary Clinton as well as Fox for the questions to be tough, something we should not fear as long as she has an opportunity to answer. I know she will do well with adequate preparation, and especially after yesterday s excellent statement taking full responsibility for mixing personal an official business on a single email device.I still believe the issue of the wiping out of the private server still needs to be dealt with   e.g., simply stating that was done primarily to protect personal privacy on personal emails but she made the mistake of mixing personal with official on the server because she was using a single device, and she should have been more transparent shortly after she left office. This interview has the potential to be a ratings and media bonanza. I have confidence she would hit a political home run and have a massive audience to deliver her message without a filter. Of course there is a risk that Megan will try to show how tough she can be, even tougher than on Trump. I am assuming the worst case on that risk. But if we have a guarantee, which I believe We will get, that she will have an uninterrupted chance to respond to every question, and we have time to prepare, I think this could be a major plus and even a game changer in the various negative narratives about the Secretary being largely inaccessible and sometimes testy with the media.Here is a screen shot of the original email:",left-news,"Nov 4, 2016",0,2678

Iran nuclear deal fight threatens Senate spending bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A battle over implementation of the Iran nuclear deal erupted on the U.S. Senate floor on Wednesday as Democrats maneuvered to block a Republican amendment stopping the Obama administration from buying heavy water from Tehran’s nuclear program. By a vote of 50-46, Democrats and four Republicans banded together to stop a fiscal 2017 energy spending bill, in order to keep Republican Senator Tom Cotton from offering his amendment to the measure. The legislation had needed 60 ‘yes’ votes to move ahead. President Barack Obama’s administration had warned Congress that it strongly opposed any move to prevent the planned purchase of $8.6 million worth of heavy water, which is non-radioactive and used in nuclear reactors and for making nuclear weapons. Under last year’s nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and five other world powers, Tehran is responsible for reducing its stock of the substance, which it can sell, dilute or dispose of, under certain conditions. The dust-up put a crimp in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plans to spend the next several weeks advancing bipartisan appropriations bills to keep the federal government functioning beyond Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. Before the vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told reporters that if Democrats allowed the bill to proceed, potentially clearing the way for a vote on the Cotton amendment, Republicans would be emboldened “again and again and again” to attach to spending bills “poison pill” amendments the White House opposes. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Cotton’s focus was on undermining the implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran, and that the administration was “gratified” Cotton’s amendment did not advance in the Senate. “I’m confident that (Cotton) couldn’t differentiate heavy water from sparkling water,” Earnest said.Cotton said he wanted to “insure that the United States taxpayer is not subsidizing a critical component of Iran’s nuclear industry, which I would add we are not required to do under the nuclear agreement with Iran.” Every Republican in Congress opposed the nuclear agreement announced in July, joined by several of Obama’s fellow Democrats. Not trusting Tehran to keep its promise to curtail its nuclear program, some lawmakers have tried repeatedly to pass legislation the administration says would undermine it. McConnell said he would try again to pass the spending bill, accusing Democrats of finding new ways “to blow up” the appropriations process. ",politicsNews,"April 27, 2016 ",1,2595
CHECKMATE! PUTIN Offers Up Proof Of Trump’s Innocence [Video],"Putin just trolled the Democrats Haha!Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in Washington with Russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying Congress with a transcript.But a leading U.S. Republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes Putin might supply.Two U.S. officials said on Monday Trump had disclosed classified information about a planned Islamic State operation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov when they met last week, plunging the White House into a fresh controversy just four months into Trump s tenure.Trump, whose administration has been dogged by allegations that Russia helped him win the White House and that he and his allies are too cozy with Moscow, has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some U.S. and foreign politicians.President Putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on Wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that Trump had divulged secrets absurd. I spoke to him (Lavrov) today,  a smiling Putin told a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. I ll be forced to issue him (Lavrov) with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us. Not with me, nor with representatives of Russia s intelligence services. It was very bad of him. This was obvious sarcasm by Putin who is probably looking at the Democrats with disgust. Via: Reuters",politics,"May 17, 2017",0,1585
U.S. jurors hear closing arguments over Iran-linked office tower,"(Reuters) - Lawyers for the United States on Monday urged jurors to allow the U.S. government to seize a Manhattan office tower from a non-profit for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. In closing arguments at the end of a month-long trial in Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Lockard told jurors that the non-profit Alavi Foundation, the building’s majority owner, knew its minority partner, Assa Corp, was a front for Iran’s government and helped hide that fact. “They knew that when that secret got out, they stood to lose everything,” he said. The government wants to seize the 36-story building at 650 Fifth Avenue, likely worth close to $1 billion, to benefit people with judgments against Iran relating to bombings and other attacks. John Gleeson, arguing for Alavi, did not dispute that Alavi knew Assa was owned by Iran’s state-controlled Bank Melli when it entered into a partnership with it in 1989. But he said the foundation, established in the 1970s by the Shah of Iran to promote Persian and Islamic culture in the United States, was led to believe that Assa was sold before 1995, and was misled when it tried to learn more. “At every turn, it was either ignored, or given the run-around, or lied to,” Gleeson said. Lockard told jurors that Alavi continued to turn rental income from the building over to Assa after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran in 1995, violating those sanctions. He pointed to evidence including testimony from former Alavi board member Seyed Mojtaba Hesami-Kiche, a key government witness. He said a letter from another former board member to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei referred to the United States as “the Great Satan” and suggested Alavi was working for Iran. Lockard acknowledged that much of the evidence was from before 1995, but said Alavi personnel did not “forget” who controlled Assa when the sanctions took effect. Gleeson described Alavi as a legitimate non-profit raising money for charitable activities. He attacked the credibility of Hesami-Kiche, who was paid by the U.S. government and admitted on the stand that he initially failed to pay taxes on that money. Gleeson is expected to continue his arguments on Tuesday. The government will be allowed a brief response. ",politicsNews,"June 26, 2017 ",1,2332

"“DRIVE THEM OUT OF YOUR PLACES OF WORSHIP!” London Imams Take President Trump’s Advice, REFUSE To Perform Funeral Rights For Islamic Terrorists [VIDEO]","President Trump gave a powerful speech to Arab leaders at the opening of the new Global Centre for Combatting Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017. In his historic speech, President Trump warned Islamic extremists:  If you choose terror, your life will be brief and your life will be empty.  Trump went on to tell the Arab leaders and the entire world, We are not here to lecture and tell you how to live. We are here to work together to meet one goal and meet history s great test to conquer extremism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent of hatred. Young Muslims should be able to build prosperity for themselves. This will be the beginning of the end for those who fight terror. This special gathering will one day be remembered as the start of peace in the Middle East and potentially all over the world. Watch the clip of President Trump telling Arab leaders in Riyadh and around the world to  drive out terrorism  from their nations and from their places of worship:It appears that the Imams in London were listening after East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman boldly announced to Muslims everywhere that if they commit acts of terror against innocent people, they will not receive funeral rights in London mosques.British police on Tuesday named the final member of the terror trio that murdered seven people on Saturday in a knife and van attack before police shot the jihadis dead   and the news comes as more than 130 Muslim religious leaders were refusing to say funeral prayers for any members of the ISIS cell.The decision by the Muslim leaders was seen as an  unprecedented  move because the funeral ritual is typically performed on a deceased Muslim no matter the person s past actions. The group of religious leaders have urged others to join them in declining to pray for the dead killers. We, as Muslim imams and religious leaders, condemn the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London in the strongest terms possible,  the Muslim leaders said in a statement.  Coming from a range of backgrounds, and from across the U.K.; feeling the pain the rest of the nation feels, we have come together to express our shock and utter disgust at these cold-blooded murders. We are deeply hurt that a spate of terror attacks have been committed in our country once more by murderers who seek to gain religious legitimacy for their actions. We seek to clarify that their reprehensible actions have neither legitimacy nor our sympathy. East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman said the decision was made because  those who perpetrate terrorism: you are against the very core teaching of Islam and of our Prophet Muhammad. Your misguidance will lead you to destruction, and God willing you will utterly fail in your evil aims,  he said in a statement.The decision underscores a warning President Trump issued to the Islamic world last month. Speaking in Riyadh before the leaders of 50 Muslim majority countries, Trump told warned terrorists that taking innocent lives would not lead to eternal paradise. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  Trump said.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also applauded the move. He said he was encouraged by the imams and said that the decision means  they re condemning their souls  since the funeral prayer asks for forgiveness of the dead. And that is what has to be done,  he said.Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-born Italian man, was identified Tuesday morning as the final member of the trio that descended upon the London Bridge on Saturday.Mak Chishty, the Metropolitan police commander of engagement, said, according to The Guardian, that it is time for Muslims to  counter the scourge of terrorism, extremism and hatred that we have in our communities at present. Chishty, the highest-ranking officer in the department of Muslim faith, said,  It is the Islamic duty of every Muslim to be loyal to the country in which they live. We are now asking questions to understand how extremism and hatred has taken hold within some elements of our own communities.   FOX News ",politics,"Jun 6, 2017",0,4417
More Bali flights canceled on forecast of volcanic ash,"DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Airlines canceled more flights departing the Indonesian holiday island of Bali on Saturday, citing forecasts of deteriorating flying conditions due to a risk of volcanic ash from the erupting Mount Agung volcano. A Bali airport spokesman said the airport was still operating normally, but airlines such as Jetstar and Virgin Australia had opted to cancel some flights   Bali flying conditions expected to be clear throughout the day, but forecast for tonight has deteriorated so several flights have been canceled,  Australian budget airline Jetstar said on its Twitter account. The erupting volcano had closed the airport for much of this week, stranding thousands of visitors from Australia, China and other countries, before the winds changed and flights resumed Twenty flights were canceled on Friday evening due to concerns over ash. Some airlines including Malaysia s AirAsia Bhd have said they would only operate out of Bali during the day, as the ash could impair visibility at night and wind conditions in the area were unpredictable. Airlines avoid flying through volcanic ash as it can damage aircraft engines, clogging fuel and cooling systems, hampering pilot visibility and even causing engine failure. There are also concerns over changing weather conditions with a tropical cyclone south of Java island impacting weather and wind in the area, including for Bali, the Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics agency said  With some airlines continuing to fly normally on Saturday, there was frustration among passengers.  Australian couple Justine and Greg Hill were on holiday with their two teenage children and had been due to fly out today but their flight later this evening was canceled.   It s more an inconvenience than anything. Don t understand why if other airlines are flying, some others aren t. Obviously there must be safety protocols but there s no detailed explanation,  said Greg Hill, 46, who was waiting at the airport.  Several foreign consulates have set up booths in the international departures area to assist stranded passengers.  Subrata Sarkar, India s vice consul in Bali, told Reuters at the airport s international departure area that they had helped around 500 passengers so far this week.   We have advised citizens the volcano may erupt. We never say  please don t come . But we have issued travel advisories. If it s urgent business, then ok, but if it s only tourism, then plans should be reconsidered,  said Sarkar.

 Trump Admin. Tosses Out Another Obama Rule – His Sons Can Be Even Worse Douchebags Now,"President Donald Trump has overturned another Obama-era legislation, this time the 2014 ban on trophy hunting permits, particularly those of elephants killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia, a US Fish and Wildlife Service official has confirmed. Trump s sons, Don Jr., and Eric, love being trophy-hunting douchebags and this will allow them to be even more blatant about it.Don Jr., has hunted elephants before, and elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. That exact act also contained a provision that allows for the granting of permits for the trophy-hunting of elephants if the hunters can prove that the demise of the singular animal in question helped benefit the conservation of the entire species. It s unlikely the Trump sons care about conservation, and only about their own glory and bragging rights.Nevertheless, a spokesman for Fish and Wildlife said,  Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. Despite large-scale conservation efforts, the wild elephant population in Africa plummeted 30% overall between 2007 and 2014 and by as much as 75% in some areas as a result of ivory poaching, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Prior to European colonization in the early 20th century, it is estimated that the wild elephant population in Africa was approximately 20 million, but dropped to 1.7 million by 1979. That number looks even more bleak when at last count in 2016 there were only just over 352,000 of the animals remaining on Africa s savanna in a survey where Namibia did not release any figures and surveys in South Sudan and the Central African Republic were postponed due to armed conflict.Last year, 182 countries signed an agreement to end the legal ivory trade in domestic markets, however, Zimbabwe is one of few that has tried to have that ban lifted and soon they may be successful with the help of President Trump. This new change would only apply to Zimbabwe and Zambia, but with Robert Mugabe s recent removal and the military seizing control of Zimbabwe, they have bigger issues to deal with at the moment.It makes you wonder why President Trump would be so interested in elephant poaching. Is it another distraction, this time from the possibility of Zimbabwe falling into a constitutional crisis? Could it be because he just likes the look of ivory in Trump Tower?Or is it simply because Trumps just miss slaughtering endangered wildlife for the sheer pleasure of it?Figures. pic.twitter.com/7LrFJeqaIY  Snarkar?ni  ?

Exclusive: Trump complains Saudis not paying fair share for U.S. defense,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump complained on Thursday that U.S. ally Saudi Arabia was not treating the United States fairly and Washington was losing a “tremendous amount of money” defending the kingdom. In an interview with Reuters, Trump confirmed his administration was in talks about possible visits to Saudi Arabia and Israel in the second half of May. He is due to make his first trip abroad as president for a May 25 NATO summit in Brussels and could add other stops. “Frankly, Saudi Arabia has not treated us fairly, because we are losing a tremendous amount of money in defending Saudi Arabia,” he said. Trump’s criticism of Riyadh was a return to his 2016 election campaign rhetoric when he accused the kingdom of not pulling its weight in paying for the U.S. security umbrella. “Nobody’s going to mess with Saudi Arabia because we’re watching them,” Trump told a campaign rally in Wisconsin a year ago. “They’re not paying us a fair price. We’re losing our shirt.” The United States is the main supplier for most Saudi military needs, from F-15 fighters to control and command systems worth tens of billions of dollars in recent years, while American contractors win major energy deals. The world’s top oil exporter and its biggest consumer have enjoyed close economic ties for decades, with U.S. firms building much of the infrastructure of the modern Saudi state after its oil boom in the 1970s. Saudi officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Trump’s latest comments. But Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir rejected similar comments from Trump during his election campaign, telling CNN during a visit to Washington last July that the Islamic kingdom “carries its own weight” as an ally. Saudi Arabia’s powerful deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Trump last month in a meeting that was hailed by a senior Saudi adviser as a “historical turning point” in relations. The talks appeared to signal a meeting of minds on many issues, including their shared view that Iran posed a regional security threat. Riyadh and other Gulf allies see in Trump a strong president who will shore up Washington’s role as their main strategic partner and help contain Riyadh’s adversary Iran in a region central to U.S. security and energy interests, regional analysts said. Asked about the fight against Islamic State, which Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies are confronting as a coalition, Trump said the militant group had to be defeated. “I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation,” Trump said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism. “There is an end. Otherwise it’s really tough. But there is an end,” without detailing a strategy. A visit to Israel would reciprocate a White House visit in February by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is due to meet Trump next Wednesday in Washington. Trump has set a more positive tone with Israel than his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, who often clashed with the right-wing Israeli leader, and has raised concerns among Palestinians that their leaders may not get equal treatment. Trump has also asked Israel to put unspecified limits on its building of Jewish settlements on land the Palestinians want for a state, and has promised to seek a Middle East peace deal that eluded his predecessors. However, he has offered no new diplomatic prescriptions. “I want to see peace with Israel and the Palestinians,” he said. “There is no reason there’s not peace between Israel and the Palestinians - none whatsoever.” Trump brushed aside a question of whether he might use a possible trip to Israel to declare U.S. recognition of the entire city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a reversal of longstanding U.S. foreign policy likely to draw international condemnation. “Ask me in a month on that,” he said, without elaborating. If Trump ties an Israel visit to next month’s Brussels trip, it would be around the time Israelis are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, when Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Successive U.S. administrations as well as the international community have not recognized Israel’s annexation of the eastern part of the city, and the future status of Jerusalem remains one of the thorniest issues in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Israel claims all of Jerusalem, which contains sites sacred to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths, as its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state of their own.

U.S. officials step up rhetoric on Russia link to email hacks,"(Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Sunday that evidence implicated Russia in recent email hacks tied to the Nov. 8 U.S. election, contradicting his running mate, Donald Trump, who has cast doubt on Russia’s involvement. Pence’s comments came after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said in an interview that aired on Sunday that the United States would be sending a message to Russia “at the time of our choosing” about the email attacks. Obama administration officials initially refused to say if they thought Russia was behind the attacks, before accusing Moscow for the first time earlier this month. President Barack Obama said in an interview with NBC News that “anything’s possible” when asked if Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee. “What we do know is the Russians hack our systems, not just government systems, but private systems,” Obama said. “But what the motives were in terms of the leaks and all that, I can’t say directly, but what I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin.” Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking about the hack of the DNC emails, said the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to “make the call on attribution” as to who was responsible. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson offered state officials help from hacking threats or other possible election tampering, in the face of unsubstantiated allegations by Trump that the system is open to fraud. Speaking at a conference in Washington, Clapper said that “the Russians hack our systems all the time,” but he did not officially blame them for the intrusions into Democratic Party organizations. During a live interview with the Washington Post, Clapper said Russia had a tradition of trying to interfere in elections in other countries. He added that his biggest concern was not that a foreign power would try to affect the outcome of the U.S. election but instead “cast doubt on the whole process.” The U.S. government for the first time formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.  “We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,” the Obama administration said in a statement. Biden said in an interview with NBC News that the United States would send a “proportional” response to Russia for the hacking “at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.” ",politicsNews,"October 16, 2016 ",1,2610
WE WILL NOT COMPLY! VA Residents Refuse To Obey Leftist Governor’s Ban On Confederate Flag License Plates,"The first shot against PC tyranny in Virginia has been fired!Earlier this year, after racist terrorist Dylann Storm Roof was charged with shooting nine black people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church, the media and Democrats across the nation embarked on a crusade to wipe the Confederate flag from society.One of the crusaders, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, decided to get rid of license plates containing the Confederate flag altogether and informed those with such license plates that they had until October to hand the license plates over to the Department of Motor Vehicles.Those found driving with the plates will be charged with a misdemeanor.On Friday, local station WAVY reported that the vast majority of citizens with such license plates have refused to comply with the government s flag-recall notice. The DMV stated that just 187 Virginians had returned their license plates out of 1,600 who had received a recall notice.One of those who has refused to heed the call is Kevin Collier, commander of the Stonewall Camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, whose great-great-great-grandfather fought with the Confederacy.  Next thing you know, they re going to say you can t wear blue on Monday  or you can t wear yellow on Thursday,  he told WAVY.  Where s it going to end? The answer: It isn t. In forwarding the regulation, McAuliffe said the Confederate flag was  unnecessarily divisive and hurtful.  He added,  Even its display on state-issued license tags is, in my view, unnecessarily divisive and hurtful to too many of our people.  Apparently, McAuliffe missed the fact that the victims in Charleston did not suffer from hurt feelings thanks to license plates, but from murder at the hands of a racist renegade criminal. But government s job is now to protect feelings rather than lives. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Oct 18, 2015",0,1941

Groups see climate science review as chance to undercut regulation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will soon begin a review that will question the veracity of the climate change science used by President Barack Obama’s administration as the basis for environmental regulations.  The move by the Environmental Protection Agency to launch public debates between scientists on climate research, known as red-team, blue-team exercises, would be the first major effort by the Republican administration to challenge the long-standing scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.  Advocates who have petitioned the EPA to reverse the scientific finding underlying U.S. regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions see the proposal to scrutinize mainstream climate science as a first step in that direction. “It’s a way to survey the landscape before reopening the endangerment finding,” said Myron Ebell, head of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, one of the groups that filed a petition with the agency to undo the 2009 scientific determination that formed the basis for the Democratic Obama administration’s regulation of greenhouse gases. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had authority under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from cars if the agency determined they endangered human health.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has spoken several times about the merits of opening the climate change debate up to the public. The website Climatewire on Friday cited a senior administration official, who said Pruitt plans to launch the back-and-forth scientific critiques formally.  Francis Menton, a lawyer who filed an endangerment finding petition in January on behalf of the Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council, said Pruitt told an event at the Manhattan Institute think tank in New York on Friday that he would launch the debates in the next few months. Menton said he asked Pruitt whether he had made a decision on reopening the endangerment finding. Pruitt said the agency is weighing its options. The review “can create a body of scientific work that can be trustworthy and dependable to make regulatory choices and decisions,” said Rob Henneke, of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a third group that filed an endangerment finding petition.  Unlike the other two, it has challenged the legality of the endangerment finding, not the science. Environmental groups are confident that Pruitt will not be successful if he tries to undo the endangerment finding because they expect the courts will side with the scientific consensus that human beings cause climate change. Pruitt and the EPA would need to build up a new case that shows carbon dioxide is innocuous and counter the volumes of scientific research that support the finding. “If he has any grasp of scientific and legal reality, he would realize that it’s a fool’s errand to reverse the endangerment determination,” said David Doniger, climate director for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel.  “This could be a way for him to keep the right-wing fringe groups occupied and also accomplish the goal of further confusing the public debate,” he said. Ebell, who was also the transition leader of the Trump EPA, had previously been critical of Pruitt’s hesitation to take on the endangerment finding because of the time and staffing it would require.  The Trump administration has not yet appointed second-tier assistant administrators to run different policy divisions of the agency. “I think (the red-team, blue-team process) is a logical first step, but I don’t think it commits the administrator to anything yet,” Ebell said.

Trump University told students how to 'cash in' on housing crash,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s eponymous business seminar program created a class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures during the housing crisis. Trump University promised in 2009 that its “Fast Track to Foreclosure Investing” would teach students how to take advantage of the crisis, according to university documents unsealed last week in a lawsuit against the now-defunct program.     The release will likely stoke criticism from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who last week accused her likely rival in the Nov. 8 presidential election of having cheered on the 2008 housing crash as an investment opportunity. A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although Trump reacted to Clinton’s criticism last week, saying: “What am I going to do? I’m in business.” A Trump University advertisement released in the case said one of its free investor workshops would explain how to “Cash in on one of the greatest property liquidations in history!” Trump University instructors were to teach students how to “capitalize without harm” and find ways for “sellers to move on without shame,” according to a December 2008 summary of the seminar. An earlier 2007 memo to enrollment counselors stated that about 1.5 million U.S. homeowners would face foreclosure that year and laid out how they should advise students to seize the “tremendous opportunity” to purchase properties at “major discounts” in “hot markets” such as Arizona, Florida and Texas. The roughly 400 pages of documents included “playbooks” on how to recruit students, directions for how instructors should deal with the media and other details about Trump’s seminar program. They were unsealed on Friday by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump called “hostile” and “a hater,” adding he believed the judge was Mexican. New York’s attorney general slammed Trump on Tuesday for his comment on the judge’s ethnicity. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Clinton’s attack on Trump last week was prompted by recently released audio that Trump recorded in 2006 for Trump University. In remarks on a possible “bubble burst,” Trump said in the recording: “I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy” to “make a lot of money.” ",politicsNews,"May 31, 2016 ",1,2502

They did not deny that the handshake image was faked, they focused on their anti-Rubio talking points.

And let s not let Rubio s dirty campaign tactics get a free pass here   Rubio is having his supporters crash opponent events and tape literature inside women s bathroom stalls, and his campaign is running intentionally misleading statewide robocalls. Again, Rubio will do anything to distract away from his liberal record.

Israeli cabinet minister welcomes Spicer's apology over Hitler remarks,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A senior member of Israel’s government welcomed on Wednesday White House spokesman Sean Spicer’s apology for saying Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons, comments that overlooked the killing of millions of Jews in Nazi gas chambers. “Since he apologized and retracted his remarks, as far as (I) am concerned, the matter is over,” Intelligence and Transport Minister Israel Katz said in a statement, citing the “tremendous importance of historical truth and remembrance” of the victims of the Holocaust. Spicer made the assertion at a daily news briefing, during a discussion about the April 4 chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed 87 people. Washington has blamed the attack on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons,” Spicer said when asked about Russia’s alliance with the Syrian government. The Nazis murdered six million Jews during World War Two. Many Jews as well as others were killed in gas chambers in European concentration camps. When a reporter asked Spicer if he wanted to clarify his comments, he said: “I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.” Later on Tuesday, Spicer apologized and said he should not have made that comparison. “It was a mistake. I shouldn’t have done it and I won’t do it again,” Spicer told CNN in an interview. “It was inappropriate and insensitive.” Spicer’s assertion, made during the Jewish holiday of Passover, sparked instant outrage on social media and from some Holocaust memorial groups who accused him of minimizing Hitler’s crimes. Katz, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s party, had tweeted late on Tuesday that Spicer’s comments at the news briefing were “grave and outrageous”, and he said the White House spokesman should apologize or resign. There was no immediate comment from other Israeli leaders, during a Passover holiday period when government business is largely at a standstill and many in the country are on vacation. It was not the first time the White House has had to answer questions about the Holocaust. Critics in January noted the administration’s statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which omitted any mention of Jewish victims. At the time, Spicer defended that statement by saying it had been written in part by a Jewish staff member whose family members had survived the Holocaust. Despite these difficulties, relations between Trump administration and the Israeli government have been more cordial than under the Obama presidency, although differences remain over the scope of Israeli settlement-building.

Trump says son is 'innocent' over emails about Russian campaign help,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his eldest son as “innocent” following emails that showed Donald Trump Jr. welcomed Russian help against his father’s rival in the 2016 presidential election, deepening the controversy over purported Russian meddling. Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday that revealed he had eagerly agreed to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow’s official support for his father. Trump Jr., in a Fox News television interview Tuesday, said: “In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.”  The president, after initially releasing a statement calling his son “high-quality,” on Wednesday praised the TV appearance and again condemned news coverage and investigations into his campaign’s alleged links to Russia. “He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Christopher Wray, Trump’s nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday he did not consider special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling to be a “witch hunt.” The emails offered the most concrete evidence to date that Trump campaign officials embraced an offer of Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump’s presidency and spurred multiple investigations. The emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities.   U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from Democratic Party officials.            The Justice Department and Congress are both investigating alleged Russian interference in the election and possible collusion with Trump’s campaign.  Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia     and Moscow has denied meddling.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday it was preposterous that Trump’s eldest son was under attack for meeting the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. “I learned with surprise that a Russian lawyer, a woman, is being blamed and Trump’s son is being blamed for meeting. For me, this is wild,” Lavrov told a news conference in Brussels.          The allegations that Russia tried to help Trump win the election has cast a cloud over his presidency. White House aides say the president keenly watches cable TV news, which he often mentions in his tweets. Trump denied that on Wednesday, saying the White House was focused on getting healthcare and tax reforms through Congress. “The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.,” Trump wrote on Twitter.  One of the president’s personal attorneys, Jay Sekulow, in a series of TV interviews on Wednesday said Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya was not a violation of the law and that the president was unaware of the meeting and the emails until recently.  “There’s no illegality,” he told NBC’s “Today” program.      Trump Jr. said that Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager at the time, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, who has denied having Kremlin ties.

"Youngstown, Ohio, mayor gets probation in corruption plea deal","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, was sentenced on Monday to a year of probation for his role in a public corruption case involving a property deal made while he was a county commissioner, a county prosecutor’s office said, but he will remain in office.   Youngstown Mayor John McNally, a Democrat, was sentenced in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in Cleveland after pleading guilty to four misdemeanor counts, said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor spokesman Joe Frolik. The plea deal allows McNally, who was elected mayor in 2014, to remain in office. The charges stemmed from his nine years as Mahoning County commissioner, from 2005 until he was elected mayor. McNally had faced multiple felony charges, including bribery, record tampering and money laundering. But as part of the agreement with prosecutors he pleaded guilty to two counts of falsification, one count of attempted unlawful use of telecommunications and one count of attempted restrictions on present or former public officials, all misdemeanors, officials said.  Under Ohio law, a felony conviction bars anyone from holding most public offices for seven years. Also on Monday, former Mahoning County Auditor Michael Sciortino was sentenced by Judge Janet Burnside to one year of probation after pleading guilty to one felony count and three misdemeanors for his role in the matter, Frolik said.  Based on the plea deals, McNally had faced a maximum of 36 months in prison and Sciortino a maximum of 2-1/2 years.     Both McNally and Sciortino were initially charged for taking part in a scheme to inflate the cost of moving the Mahoning County jobs and family services office from a rental property to benefit a local business owner, prosecutors said. In addition to the plea in the Cuyahoga County court, Sciortino agreed to plead guilty to one felony and one misdemeanor in Mahoning County court on Thursday, according to court records.     Youngstown attorney Martin Yavorcik, 42, was convicted on eight felony counts in the Cuyahoga County court on Friday as part of the 83-count indictment brought against the three men in 2014 by the Ohio Attorney General’s office alleging a pattern of corruption.  Sentencing for Yavorcik is scheduled for April 22. He faces up to 29 years in prison, Frolik said. ",politicsNews,"March 28, 2016 ",1,2353
 Trump Started A War With McConnell And The Oldest GOP Senator Is Coming For Him Guns Blazing,"Donald Trump just LOVES attacking members of his own party. Seemingly not understanding that the 535 people in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate are a co-equal branch of government and can totally kneecap him and even remove him from office if they so choose, Trump has been steadily attacking a GOP stalwart: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.First, Trump decided that McConnell needed to  get back to work  on his failed healthcare legislation. Then, he suggested that McConnell should resign if he cannot get Trump s legislative agenda through the Senate. Well, it seems that other GOP Senators are sick and tired of Trump s bullying of their Senate leader, and are coming after him.First, Orrin Hatch, who is easily the oldest member of the Senate at age 83, had his office release the following cryptic message regarding Trump s attacks on McConnell:""@SenateMajLdr has been the best leader we ve had in my time in the Senate, through very tough challenges.

Obama Expected To Release Plan To Close GITMO…And Give It Back To Cuba?,"There s so much to this effort to close GITMO that it s hard to know where to begin. First of all, one of Obama s campaign promises was to close GITMO. Here we are late in his second term and he s still doing everything he can to close this prison for terrorists. We ve dumped millions into the facility, even building a $750,000 soccer field. The Republicans have been blocking Obama s efforts but it s looking more and more like an executive order will be the only way GITMO will close. The second aspect of this Obama plan is that Obama may give GITMO back to Cuba. Raul Castro voiced a desire to have GITMO returned back in January:Cuba President Raul Castro said that if the United States wants to smooth relations, then the United States must first turn over Guantanamo Bay. The reestablishment of diplomatic relations is the start of a process of normalizing bilateral relations, but this will not be possible while the blockade still exists, while they don t give back the territory illegally occupied by the Guantanamo naval base,  Mr. Castro said, AP reported.Gitmo was established by the United States in 1903. Cuba has been demanding the United States give it over to its authority for decades.I wouldn t put it past Obama to give Guantanamo Bay back to Cuba. This is clearly a political move by Obama who s protecting his legacy over the safety and security of the American people. Can you imagine having these terrorists housing in the city you live in?The Pentagon is expected to release a plan next week on President Obama s years-long effort to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center that suggests a Colorado prison dubbed  the Alcatraz of the Rockies  as one suitable site to relocate expected life-long detainees, Obama administration officials say.Obama made a campaign promise in his 2008 White House bid to close the facility, arguing the move would be in the United States  best financial, national security and foreign policy interests and in the name of justice   considering some of the detainees have been held for nearly nine years without trial or sentencing.However, critics of the promise, including many Republicans, fear transferring detainees to the U.S. mainland as part of an overall closure plan poses too much of a homeland security risk. They also say the president has yet to submit a closure plan and have been critical of the administration recently allowing some known terrorists to return to the Middle East.The Florence, Colo., prison is among seven U.S. facilities in Colorado, Kansas and South Carolina being considered.The Pentagon plan represents a last-gasp effort by the administration to convince staunch opponents in Congress that dangerous detainees who can t be transferred safely to other countries should be housed in a U.S.-based prison.

German liberals would expect finance ministry in Merkel coalition,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Free Democrats (FDP) would want the finance ministry in exchange for joining Chancellor Angela Merkel in the country s next coalition government, a member of the party s executive said. Setting out conditions days before federal elections that Merkel is almost certain to win, albeit short of an absolute majority, the FDP also ruled out partnering her conservatives if she supported French plans to deepen fiscal integration in the euro zone. Often viewed as Merkel s natural allies, the socially liberal FDP were part of her second government from 2009 to 2013. They crashed out of parliament that year but are hoping to re-enter the legislature on Sunday as the third-largest party. Current Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, of Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU), has held the post since 2009 and is the most high-profile member of her cabinet. But Alexander Hahn, a member of the FDP s national executive, said the ministry should go to someone from his party.  The FDP should enter no government in which it cannot name a finance minister,  Hahn told mass-market daily Bild in remarks published on Monday. On Sunday, FDP leader Christian Lindner said setting the agenda for Europe was the most important issue for his party in any coalition talks with the conservatives after the Sept. 24 vote.  I fear that Ms Merkel has already agreed to new funding mechanisms (for the EU) with (French President Emmanuel) Macron,  he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.   Everything that goes in the direction of financial transfer on the European level, be it a euro zone budget or a banking union, is a red line for us . Macron, who is to present his views on the future of the euro zone on Sept. 26, has called for a finance minister and a standalone budget for the bloc, while European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday urged EU governments to use economic recovery as a springboard toward closer union. Merkel has said she would work with Macron on strengthening the euro zone. But Germany remains insistent that member states should take primary responsibility for their own economic problems, a principle whose prime exponent has been Schaeuble. He is revered by a significant part of the conservative voter base who see him as a guardian of their austerity-oriented interests in the euro zone. The FDP, who held the foreign minister in their last union with the conservatives, have reinvented themselves under Lindner, who preaches a hard line on Europe. They are polling 8 to 10 percent in surveys, while Merkel s conservatives are on around 37 percent, leaving their combined forces just short of a majority. Analysts say completing a banking union and creating a euro zone budget would provide more stability for the currency bloc, and that a conservative/FDP coalition might threaten such plans.  I fear there could be a strong reaction on bond markets should the FDP push for a literal enforcement of fiscal rules or for an expulsion of Greece as part of a future ruling coalition,  said Martin Lueck of asset manager BlackRock. A grand coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel s current partners and polling around 23 percent, would make it much easier for the chancellor to work with Macron on overhauling the euro zone. The centre-left SPD have often criticized Schaeuble s tough stance on Greece and have even backed the idea of common euro zone debt. The FDP are fighting for third spot against the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is forecast to enter parliament for the first time. ",worldnews,"September 17, 2017 ",1,3647
Japan's Abe to propose new cabinet level talks with United States: government official,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will propose new cabinet level U.S.-Japan talks on trade, security and macroeconomic issues, including currencies, when he meets U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday, a Japanese government official involved in planning the summit said. Abe heads to Washington later on Thursday hoping promises to help create U.S. jobs and bolster Japan’s military will persuade Trump to turn down the heat on trade and currency and stand by the decades-old alliance. “In a situation in which security relations in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly severe, it is very important to demonstrate the unshakeable U.S.-Japan alliance at home and abroad,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. “This is the most important theme of the U.S.-Japan leaders summit,” he said, adding it was also vital to have constructive discussions on how to create a “win-win” relationship by further strengthening U.S.-Japan economic ties. Trump has lumped Japan with China and Mexico as big contributors to the U.S. trade deficit, targeted its auto trade as “unfair” and accused Tokyo of using monetary policy to devalue its currency to boost exports. “We use monetary easing, fiscal policy and structural reform in order to escape from deflation. We don’t engage in competitive currency devaluation or target specific levels,”    Masahiko Shibayama, an adviser to the premier, told Reuters. “We’ll explain based on the fact that Japanese automakers are contributing to U.S. jobs through their local subsidiaries.” During his election campaign, Trump complained Tokyo was not sharing enough of the cost of the U.S. security umbrella although his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, assured Japan the alliance was firm when he visited the country last week.  Abe, who will be accompanied by Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, will bring a package of steps Tokyo says could create 700,000 U.S. jobs through private-public investment in infrastructure such as high-speed trains, government sources say. Trump, who abandoned the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact championed by his predecessor Barack Obama and Abe as a counterweight to a rising China, has made clear he wants a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with Tokyo instead. Abe has left the door open to FTA talks but Japanese officials worry such negotiations would boost pressure on politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture while yielding few economic benefits for Japan. The new cabinet level talks, the government official told Reuters, would be a way of buying time rather than opening FTA talks at an early stage.  Tokyo and Washington already have a cabinet-level mechanism for security talks, the so-called “2-plus-2” meetings of defense and foreign ministers. The new economic framework will be headed by Aso, who is also deputy prime minister, and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, and would address a range of issues, with a focus on crafting trade policies and measures to bolster U.S. employment, said a report in the Nikkei business daily. Abe is likely to propose crafting highly liberal rules for trade and investment in areas such as intellectual property protection, rules of origin, regulations on state-owned companies and e-commerce, the Nikkei said. Japan hopes such bilateral rules would be similar to those agreed upon in the TPP and could be extended to cover the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s growing clout, it added. The two nations are also preparing statements regarding economic cooperation and security to be issued after the summit meeting, the Nikkei said.  Abe and Trump will also play a round of gold in Florida this weekend after the meeting at the White House on Friday and Trump said he will make sure the Japanese leader is his partner in the game, rather than a competitor.

SEC Chair White defies Republican requests to stall rulemaking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White on Monday defied requests by Senate Republicans to delay adopting new rules on everything from derivatives to mutual funds until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office. In a letter to the Senate Banking Committee’s top two Republicans, Chairman Richard Shelby and Mike Crapo of Idaho, White stressed it was “incumbent” on the SEC to “exhibit a spirit of firm independence” in performing its regulatory duties “without fear or favor.”  White’s Dec. 12 letter, which was reviewed by Reuters, comes in response to a request last month by Shelby and Crapo for the SEC to cease adopting rules until after Trump had a chance to review the agency’s agenda.  Republicans in Congress have been pressing agencies across the federal government to wind down their rulemaking activities.    Trump has vowed to kill many regulations put on the books during the Obama administration, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  White, an independent, is slated to step down from her post at the end of Democratic President Barack Obama’s term in January.  The Senate failed to confirm Obama’s two nominees for vacant commissioner slots at the SEC before it recessed last week, which means that after White departs next month, the SEC will only be left with two commissioners - one Democrat and one Republican.  Even before she leaves, she could still fail to get the rules passed if she cannot get a quorum of commissioners to agree. Trump has yet to announce a nominee for SEC chair, but many of the people working on his financial regulatory transition team, such as former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, have been highly critical of many of the SEC’s rules and Dodd-Frank more broadly. In White’s letter on Monday, she provided Shelby and Crapo with a list of all the rules currently ready for a vote.  Among the rules on the list are derivatives reforms mandated by Dodd-Frank, such as capital and margin requirements for swap dealers, as well as a more controversial one that would limit how mutual funds and exchange-traded funds use derivatives to leverage returns. The letter did not say when the SEC might vote on the rules. The agency could do it during an open meeting or behind closed doors. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing. “I am not insensitive to the issues raised by your letter and have carefully considered what impact, if any, the election should have on the current work of the Commission,” White wrote. She added that she had confirmed that the SEC “historically has proceeded with its work during comparable post-election periods.”     In support of her position, White included footnotes in her letter citing prior statements by Republican SEC Commissioner Mike Piwowar, who is poised to become acting chair in January, in which he voiced support for completing new derivatives rules. This is not the first time the SEC has faced criticism on efforts to complete rules before a change in leadership at the regulator. In 2005, a federal appeals court sided with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a dispute with the SEC over controversial rules requiring the majority of mutual fund board directors to be independent. The court sent the rule back to the SEC with a directive to consider its costs.  Then-SEC Chairman William Donaldson promptly scheduled a meeting and the SEC re-adopted it a day before his resignation, saying the rule would not be overly costly. The rule was subsequently overturned a second time, and the court chided the SEC for failing to follow proper rulemaking procedures. Even if White is successful in adopting final rules in the coming weeks, Congress may have a way to undo them when Trump takes office on Jan. 20. By law, Congress can vote to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days of them becoming final - which could be easier to accomplish under a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.

NUDGING TO WAR: U.S. Shoots Down Syrian Army Fighter Jet,"21st Century Wire says Yesterday a US F/A-18E Super Hornet is reported to have shot down a Syrian Army SU-22 jet near the village of Rasafah, south of Raqqa. Washington claims it was an act of  collective self-defense  because the Syrian jet had dropped bombs  near US-backed forces.  Syrian officials in Damascus deny the US claims, stating that their plane was downed while conducting a strike on an ISIS position. According to a statement released by Damascus, the US act of aggression in Syria airspace was a flagrant attack was an attempt to undermine the efforts of the army as the only effective force capable with its allies  in fighting terrorism across its territory.  Officials added that,  this comes at a time when the Syrian army and its allies were making clear advances in fighting the (ISIS) terrorist group. US officials are claiming that pro-Syrian regime forces  on the ground attacked the US-backed Kurdish militias under the  SDF  brand (Syrian Democratic Forces) near Tabqa outside Raqqa, after which time the US-led Coalition planes engaged Syrian military. US officials then claim that a Syrian planes dropped bombs near the US-backed forces. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issue this statement:  We call on the United State and all others who have their forces or advisors on the ground [in Syria] to ensure the coordination in our work. Zones of de-escalation are one of the possible options to jointly move forward. We call on everyone to avoid unilateral moves, respect Syrian sovereignty and join our common work which is agreed with the Syrian Arab Republic s government. 21WIRE reported earlier this week how the presence of US and UK troops on the ground inside of Syrian sovereign territory may be provoking an escalation of an already tense situation in both Raqqa and in the region around al-Tanf. US-led coalition forces are supposedly there to train and assist anti-ISIS  militias, but also anti-Assad  rebel militias too. The US also also trying to impose self-styled  deconfliction zones around al-Tanf.In recent months, the Syrian Army have been making huge advances against ISIS positions. This latest US attack on Syria indicates that the US do not want the Syrian Army involved in the liberation of Raqqa   presumable to be able to stage-manage and control the operation and media coverage for its global audience, as the US did previously with Mosul in Iraq.A clear pattern has emerged with almost every US strike against Syrian forces inside of Syria   in each and every instance, the main beneficiary appears to be ISIS.Based on past incidents where US forces have attack Syrian military assets, in each instance the US attacks have benefited ISIS on the ground   leading many to conclude that the US Coalition forces are helping ISIS to gain strategic advantage against the Syria Army on the ground.Back in September 2016, US had attacked and massacred over 80 Syrian military soldiers after a  Coalition  airstrike on Dier Azor   a US attack which allowed ISIS to strategically advance past Syrian Army defensive positions. In addition to aiding ISIS on the ground, this act by the US also ruined any chance of a viable ceasefire agreement with Russia and Syria at the time.A similar events took place on June 5, 2017 when US-led coalition forces attacked what they called  pro-Syrian regime forces  near the town of al Tanf in southeast Syria, claiming the Syrian forces including some 60 troops, had somehow entered what the US claim was a  well-established de-confliction zone.  The US strike helped to take pressure off of a retreating ISIS in the region.In addition to this, the US cruise missile strike Syria s Sharat airbase near Homs killed some 80 people, supposedly in response to an alleged ;chemical weapons attack at Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province.According to Aleppo MP Fares Shehabi, the US missile attack should be viewed as  an act against an airport that is solely dedicated to fighting ISIS in Syria. And this attack is illegal, it s stupid. As it stands the US presence in Syria is in violation of both US and International Law.

"As Republican tax vote nears, more senators waver","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s drive to win passage of a sweeping Republican tax bill in the U.S. Congress hit potential obstacles on Thursday as two more Republican senators insisted on changes, joining a list of lawmakers whose support is uncertain. Florida’s Marco Rubio, a former presidential contender, told reporters on Capitol Hill that if the bill’s proposed refundability to taxpayers of the child tax credit is not expanded, “I’m a no ... It has to be higher than $1,100.” Rubio and Mike Lee of Utah are in talks with other senators about expanding child tax credit refundability, said Conn Carroll, a Lee spokesman. Lee is now “undecided on the tax bill as currently written,” Carroll said in a telephone interview. The child tax credit now in the U.S. tax code is meant to lower the tax bills of working families with children. As the fast-moving Republican tax package has evolved, it has tilted increasingly toward benefiting businesses and wealthy taxpayers, a trend that aides were saying privately is a growing concern for some lawmakers. Provisions for offsetting the revenue costs of last-minute changes also were becoming worrisomely unclear, they said.  After resisting demands for weeks to cut the top income tax rate for the richest taxpayers, the bill’s authors did agree in recent days to lower it to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. “My concern is that if you found the money to lower the top rate ... you can’t find a little bit to at least somewhat increase the refundable portion” of the child credit? Rubio said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the White House will continue to work with Rubio on the child tax credit. The headline feature of the bill is a deep cut to 21 percent from 35 percent of the corporate income tax rate, a step that corporate tax lobbyists have been pursuing for many years. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate tax committee and one of the bill’s chief authors, said the Senate would probably vote on a final Senate-House measure on Monday. He said he hoped Rubio’s concerns could be addressed. “He’s important to us,” Hatch said. “I don’t know what leadership wants to do on that. It’s a problem, no question.” The Senate approved a wide-ranging tax bill of its own on Dec. 2 by a vote of 51-49. Senator Bob Corker was the only Republican to join all 46 Senate Democrats and two independents in voting against the bill. Earlier, the House of Representatives had approved its own tax legislation. In recent days negotiators from both chambers have been scrambling to reconcile the two bills, changing specific parts on the fly to lock in enough votes to pass it. Trump has said he wants a final bill on his desk for enactment before Christmas. If it is enacted, the bill would be the first major legislative achievement for Trump and the Republicans since he took office in January.  Corker, a leading Republican fiscal hawk, reiterated that his concerns about the bill’s expansion of the federal deficit have not been addressed. Independent and nonpartisan tax analysts have estimated that the bill will expand the $20 trillion national debt by at least $1 trillion in the next 10 years. Moderate Senator Susan Collins also has been non-committal on the bill, in part out of concern about its provision to repeal an Obamacare federal fine imposed on Americans who do not buy health insurance. The Senate vote outlook has been further muddled by Senator John McCain’s admission to the hospital for treatment for side effects of cancer therapy. His office said he “looks forward to returning to work as soon as possible.”  Carroll said if the child tax credit were to be made fully refundable, it would cost about $7 billion in lost revenues over 10 years. Lee and Rubio want expanded refundability. Under current law, a maximum child tax credit of $1,000 per eligible child under 17 is allowed on a portion of family earnings. In its current form, the legislation expands that credit but Lee and Rubio are seeking more help for families, especially in lower-income brackets. The two senators failed in an effort to do that on the Senate floor when the tax bill initially was debated. Republicans have a 52-vote Senate majority. So they can lose no more than two of their own votes and still win approval, with Vice President Mike Pence able to vote to break a tie. Pence has delayed a planned trip to the Middle East in case his vote is needed on the final tax bill. ",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017 ",1,4497

On Saturday, during the Democrats of Massachusetts state convention, Warren did the best thing that you can do to a bully like Trump   gave him a taste of his own medicine.Warren has blasted Trump multiple times over the past few months, yet nothing she has said compares to the no-holds barred verbal punches she threw out during her speech at the convention.Speaking about the giant predatory scheme that was Trump University, Warren likened the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to a sleazy car salesman: It was like a used car dealership except that s not fair to used car dealerships,  Warren told the audience.  His playbook said to look for people with problems; they make good targets. Trump even encouraged his sales force to go after elderly people who were trying to build a little financial security, Warren continued.  Now, Trump University failed and that s no surprise. Think Trump Airlines, Trump Steaks, Trump Magazines, Trump Vodka, Trump Casinos, Trump Mortgage, Trump Games, Trump Travel, Trump Ice, Trump Network, Trump Radio, and Trump New Media Company. These were ordinary folks who were targeted because they had problems and Trump saw they were vulnerable and he could make a buck. Here s a man who builds a business to profit off other peoples  pain. He wants to be Commander-in-Chief, but he s only qualified to be Fraudster-in-Chief. Warren s evisceration of Trump is both thorough and rooted in factual evidence. The speech is a glorious indictment of Trump s fraudulent schemes and should serve as a reminder of just how terrible a Trump administration would be for the United States. Trump s campaign, much like his business schemes, is nothing more the exploitation of those who are desperate enough to believe that a has been reality TV star has anything to offer in the way of being a true leader.You can watch the speech below.Featured image via  video screenshot",News,"June 4, 2016",0,2074

" REPORT: Bannon Routinely Using Anti-Semitic Slur Towards Jared Kushner, WH Turning Toxic Quickly","Trump s inability to hire experienced, serious individuals to staff his White House has started to rot from the inside out. The group of men surrounding Trump on a day-to-day basis are fringe racists, incompetent liars, yes-men, goons, and at least one member of a Nazi alliance organization overseas. It s less  team of rivals and more dysfunctional group culled from the comment section at Breitbart.Worse still, Trump s two closest advisors   son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Breitbart owner Steve Bannon   reportedly despise each other, fighting  non-stop,  according to sources within the White House.Unfortunately for the dignity of the office, Trump s decision to hire white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his go-to guy is coming back to haunt him. Bannon has taken to using two disgusting phrases to refer to Kushner:  cuck  and  globalist. The word  cuck  is frequently flung around in fringe right-wing white nationalist circles and originates from  cuckhold  meant to denote emasculation. In more modern times, the term is often used by racists to describe a white woman cheating on her white husband with a black man. Bannon apparently can t stop using it in reference to Kushner. [Steve] recently vented to us about Jared being a  globalist  and a  cuck He actually said  cuck,  as in  cuckservative,  the administration official told The Daily Beast. Cuckservative,  a portmanteau of  cuckold  and  conservative,  has become a favorite slur on the right, used like a sexually and racially charged version of  RINO,  a Republican In Name Only.His other favorite is  globalist,  a term often used by white nationalists and neo-Nazi groups to mean  Jewish.  The term is considered a two-for-one slur within the right-wing community. Its origins in anti-Semitism is accented by its nativism. Here s how Daily Beast s Asawin Suebsaeng put it: Globalist  is a term typically used by nationalist, pro-Trump right-wingers against political opponents; however, the term has also come under fire for at times carrying anti-Semitic tones. (Kushner is Jewish.)The use of  globalism  as a stand-in for  Jewish  is well documented and seems to be particularly entrenched in minds of some Trump voters. Forward magazine did an excellent piece on why that is.For Bannon, Kushner represents  interests  outside of white America. Anyone outside Trump s White House probably isn t surprised what that means. Bannon is a long-time anti-Semite. According to testimony by his wife, he once vetoed sending his children to a particular school because he thought there were too many Jewish children there. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with Kushner is apparently too much for Bannon to handle and he s acting out.By the way, Bannon calling Kushner a  globalist  is reminiscent of when folks call Obama a  Muslim.  Just say the word you mean, man.  Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) April 6, 2017It seems that screaming  cuck  and  globalist  isn t winning him any arguments, even within Trump s administration. He recently got yanked for his position on the National Security Council   a spot he had no business occupying in the first place. In a clear humiliation, Bannon reportedly said he would resign if Trump dared pull him from the council. Trump called his bluff and Bannon blinked. But he s likely not forgotten the slight. Trump s White House is more toxic than ever.Sources have been leaking details non-stop and the picture is ugly. Pence hates Priebus. Trump hates Priebus. Trump hates Spicer. Spicer hates himself. Kushner hates Bannon. Bannon hates Kushner. Trump s new National Security Advisor hates Trump and everyone else in the White House.

In an e-mail to employees on Monday, BuzzFeed founder and CEO Jonah Peretti wrote: “We don’t run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we won’t accept Trump ads for the exact same reason.” “The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs,” Peretti wrote in the note, which was posted to BuzzFeed.com.  BuzzFeed declined further comment. Neither BuzzFeed nor the RNC would confirm the exact value of the deal, reported by Politico to be $1.3 million. According to an RNC official who declined to be identified, the deal was less than 1 percent of the party’s ad budget of about $150 million and was effectively a reservation for ad space, not a firm commitment to place ads with BuzzFeed. Trump’s campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she had “nothing to add.”    The RNC provides national leadership for the Republican Party.

Business as usual for Thai tourism despite royal funeral this month,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - It will be business as usual this month for Thailand s lucrative tourism industry as the country gears up for the lavish funeral of its revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the tourism agency said on Monday.  Tourism accounts for about 10 percent of Thailand s GDP and has been one of the few bright spots for Southeast Asia s second-largest economy, which has struggled since a 2014 coup by the military. One of the world s most popular travel destinations has observed a year-long period of mourning after the death in October last year of King Bhumibol, who ruled for seven decades, and will be cremated on Oct. 26 in a ceremony lasting five days.   Tourism activities will continue as normal around the country, even though Thai people will be in mourning,  Tanes Petsuwan, a deputy governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, told Reuters.  There are no restrictions on tourists at all and they can still enjoy  Amazing Thailand  while they are here,  he said, referring to a tagline trumpeted in tourism advertisements.   However, Bangkok s Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, two key landmarks in the capital, will be closed for most of the month to host the cremation.  In a travel advisory last month, the tourism agency asked tourists to behave appropriately and respect Thai sensitivities during what promises to be an emotionally-charged time for many.  We would like to request that the solemnity of the royal cremation is observed, and visitors should refrain from any inappropriate or disrespectful behavior,  it said.  While not required to wear black, tourists should stick to  respectful clothing , it added.  With its beaches, Buddhist temples and infamous night life, Thailand remains a magnet for travelers despite weathering more than a decade of unrest, including two coups, deadly floods in 2011 and a wave of bombs in tourist towns last year. It expects to welcome a record 32.4 million visitors this year.  King Bhumibol was succeeded by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne in December last year. King Vajiralongkorn has since overseen several shake-ups of palace staff and moved some agencies under his direct control, including the Crown Property Bureau, which manages most of the royal family s wealth.

"Despite deaths, German military eyes recruitment bump from new reality show","BERLIN (Reuters) - The German military, buoyed by 45 million views of its previous  social media reality show  The Recruits , is to launch a new show on Monday that shows the lives of eight soldiers serving in U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali. The six-week show provides a  realistic and authentic look  at an actual military deployment, including the crash of an Airbus Tiger helicopter in July that killed both crew members, a defense ministry spokesman said on Friday. It will be shown Mondays through Thursdays on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, with a chatbot sending messages several times a day about the soldiers  activities.  Colonel Holger Neumann said the accident would play a role in one of the later episodes and would be treated with  the necessary sensitivity . The military last month resumed flights of the Tiger helicopters, but continues to investigate the cause of the crash. The show cost 6.5 million euros to produce and market, Neumann said, describing it as part of the military s drive to make the military a more attractive career option. The last show, which showed how new recruits were trained, sparked a 40-percent increase in traffic at the ministry s career website and a 25-percent boost in calls to a recruitment hotline, he said.  Ilka Hoffmann, a board member at the GEW union that represents about 280,000 teachers, social workers and education workers, said the new program s  action film  aesthetic was clearly targeting young people and glamorizing war.  Not everything is as positive as it is portrayed. People can die during this deployment or come back traumatized,  she said.  The Bundeswehr can t want people to sign up out of a sense of adventure.  She said the union, the nonprofit group Terres des Hommes and other groups have also protested the military s school outreach program aimed at 16- and 17-year-olds, saying it viewed the recruitment drive as a violation of U.N. Convention on Children. ",worldnews,"October 13, 2017 ",1,2024
BUSTED: YOUNG NJ DEMOCRAT CHAIRMAN CAUGHT PUNCHING 75 YR OLD BLIND VETERAN VOLUNTEERING AT POLLS [Video],"As a poll challenger who has witnessed unbelievable blatant voter fraud by Democrats, I can only imagine what this poll worker might have done to cross this Democrat chairman.The chairman of the Essex County Democratic Committee in New Jersey is accused of punching a blind Army veteran following an argument at a polling location during East Orange s council primary last month.Video was released purportedly showing Leroy Jones punching 75-year-old Bill Graves, who was volunteering as a poll worker during the incident on primary day, June 2.  I hear this rumbling,  Where the blank is Bill Graves? I m gonna kick his butt!  Mr. Graves told a local ABC affiliate.  You can see on the tape it was intentional. The suspect, identified by Essex County Prosecutors as Mr. Jones, is seen throwing several punches at Mr. Graves following what appears to be a heated confrontation.Mr. Graves and his friends said Mr. Jones attacked him because he was backing a political candidate that Mr. Jones did not support, ABC reported.Mr. Jones, however, said he was defending his wife, who was also working at the polls. Mr. Jones said the veteran got aggressive with his wife during an argument, and she called her husband for help, a local CBS affiliate reported. This man threatened my wife. This man assaulted my wife. This man charged at my wife,  Mr. Jones said.Mr. Jones has been charged with simple assault, reports said. Mr. Graves was not charged.Mr. Graves, who is completely blind in one eye and legally blind in the other, said his vision has gotten worse since the attack.

He was responding to a question about whether he agreed with critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has called Trump authoritarian, and Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has likened Trump’s “strident tone” to the ascent of 1930s fascist leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Ryan also said he was not worried that the Republican-majority House of Representatives might switch to Democratic control as a result of the November elections. “I’m not concerned about the House flipping because we are in control of our own actions.” ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2016 ",1,880

" Taxpayers Billed $800,000 A Year For Prayers In Congress","American taxpayers are being charged more than $66,000 an hour for prayers said in the US House and Senate.  The total cost per prayer, which lasts an average of 90 seconds, is a whopping $1,659.According to Andrew Seidel of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who did the math to determine what taxpayers are being charged for prayers in Washington, the total annual bill comes to more than $800,000.Both the U.S. House and Senate employ a chaplain whose singular duty is to administer prayer. The budget for the House Chaplain s office is $345,000, while the Senate Chaplain s office receives $436,886.Seidel reports that both the House and Senate chaplains earn executive level salaries which are equal to those of high-ranking government officials, such as  general counsels of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the chief financial officers of NASA and the EPA; the Chief Information Officers of almost every major federal department and agency; and the Army s Director of Civil Defense. The two chaplains earn three-figure salaries for presiding over opening prayers in the house and senate, which only convene about 135 days out of the year.Seidel reports:And even with those fat salaries, the official chaplains let  guest chaplains  deliver many of the prayers about 40% in the House. The House chaplains gave 1,341 invocations over the 16 years from 2000-2015, or about 84 invocations each year. Guest chaplains gave another 857 over that same span. Congress is budgeting more than three-quarters of a million dollars every year for chaplains to give these prayers or coordinate the guest chaplains  prayers.As Seidel explains here, in 2011 the House Chaplain delivered just 104 prayers, lasting an average of 90 seconds each. That s about 2.6 hours of work. For that he was paid $172,500, or $66,346 an hour.Over the 15-year period between 2000 and 2015, US taxpayers spent $10 million on prayers in Washington. In the meantime, elected officials slashed spending on essential programs like WIC and SNAP as well as other assistance for the vulnerable.The idea that taxpayers are being billed exorbitant amounts of money for prayers, all while right-wing politicians screech about the national debt and wasteful government spending, is beyond outrageous.The church is not government and government is not a church. Everyone is free to exercise their religious beliefs in the U.S. Using millions of dollars in taxpayer money to support daily prayers in Washington, however, is not even close to acceptable.The Freedom From Religion Foundation is encouraging voters to make their voices heard on this issue by contacting their elected representatives here and here.Image credit: Wikipedia",News,"April 27, 2016",0,2770
" Gay GOP Operative Endorses Doug Jones Over ‘Bigoted, Deviant’ Roy Moore In Senate Race (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has a Roy Moore problem. Even before it came out that the judge turned Alabama Senate candidate is accused of being a child molester, he was a problem. He had been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for flagrantly defying the law. Moore has said Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He waved a gun around on stage at a campaign rally and rode a horse to the polls in Alabama to vote for himself in the primary he would eventually win against establishment-backed interim Senator Luther Strange. Well, it seems that with all of this and then some, sane Republicans have had enough of Roy Moore. One such person is former Jeb Bush campaign strategist Tim Miller. He  has a solution to his party s Roy Moore problem: Vote for the Democrat, Doug Jones, to keep Roy Moore the hell away from the United States Senate.Miller happens to be gay, so of course Moore s disgusting homophobia is a problem for him. Then there is, of course, the child molesting. In a column for the left-wing site Crooked Media entitled  The Republican Case for Doug Jones,  Miller says of his decision, which he calls,  obvious : But here we are in the dark abyss of 2017, and in this political moment, child exploitation attempted child rape, even has become a partisan issue. President Donald Trump is even cool with it, as long as the sex predator is on his team. A comrade in genital grabbing if you will. So after Trump essentially re-endorsed Alabama s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, this particular child predator, on Tuesday, I took what I thought was an obvious step. I donated to the other guy s campaign. But in this instance there was one wrinkle for me. The other guy, Doug Jones, is a Democrat. And I a Republican political operative have never donated to one of those before. Thus, in sharing the fact that I had made the donation on social media, I also noted that this was a first for me, even though it felt extremely obvious. Here is the tweet where Tim Miller announces his crossover:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well. Enough is enough. https://t.co/YlDXTXSnyJ  Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 21, 2017Tim Miller is right. Roy Moore is absolutely deplorable, and should be nowhere near the United States Senate. This isn t politics, it s morals. Now, it is time for more sane, reasonable Republicans to get out there and do the unthinkable   reject a child molester and endorse and donate to the man who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan while Roy Moore was busy creeping on little girls.

"In Mexican town, women and 'muxes' take charge after massive quake","JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Destruction wrought by Mexico s massive earthquake has put a spotlight on the quasi-matriarchal indigenous traditions of the worst affected town, with women and third-gender  muxes  playing a leading role in the aftermath of the disaster.  Located in Mexico s narrow isthmus region, about 400 miles (644 km) southeast of capital Mexico City, Juchitan bore the brunt of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that flattened thousands of buildings in the humid market town in a matter of seconds and took at least 98 lives nationwide. In vivid contrast to Mexico s macho, male-dominated society, travelers have noted since at least the 1800s the relative equality of Juchitan s mainly Zapotec men and women, as well as the prominence of muxes, Zapotecs born biologically male who mix gay and feminine identity. After the earth shook violently just before midnight on Thursday, women, muxes and men all leapt into action, in many cases pulling away rubble with their bare hands.  I carried my mother out as I left the house, and then my brother and I went to rescue my aunt who was trapped,  Peregrina Vera, a tall, 26-year-old muxe, said in a sing-song voice, her long hair tied in a bun.  She then helped pull up rubble to free her grandmother after hearing shouts for help, Vera said, sitting in an outdoor patio just beyond the collapsed walls of her house, where two aggressive pet ducks snapped brightly colored bills at visitors. Locals say there is a muxe in every Juchitan family. They are widely accepted despite an ingrained Roman Catholic heritage and known for dedication to family, especially for taking care of mothers as other siblings move out. Among the severely damaged buildings was the downtown market, the most important for miles around and the heart of Zapotec women s economic power for more than a century. Slated for demolition due to the quake damage, its loss is a blow to Juchitan s women. Irma Lopez, 44, who sold traditional indigenous clothing, was proud that 80 percent of market vendors were women but said it meant they were particularly hard hit by the destruction.   We are the ones who have lost the most,  Lopez said, standing just outside the market as a light rain fell. She was waiting for relatives to help remove her last boxes of merchandise, as trucks pulled up to haul away her and other women s goods. In an 1859 account, French traveler and historian Brasseur de Bourbourg appreciatively described the sprawling marketplace as run by strong, unrestrained women who  openly made fun of their men ... with a shamelessness hardly equaled.  Roughly eight in 10 residents of Juchitan are indigenous, mostly Zapotec. Women are typically also in charge of family finances, said Felina Santiago, a muxe and beauty shop owner, speaking outside her badly damaged home.   Many say Juchitan is the ultimate matriarchy. It s a city of women who fight, who work hard,  Santiago said.  Now more than ever, we re going to work to get back on our feet,  she said, just as a structure on her block loudly collapsed, causing a sudden stir as neighbors rushed to the spot. No one was hurt. In Juchitan s Seventh Division residential neighborhood, Margarita Lopez, a 56-year-old domestic worker, craned her head as she stood in a crowd of women waiting for a promised delivery of government aid, which turned out to be mostly canned food.  Yes, we have our husbands, and we don t leave them behind. But we women matter more. We take decisions, more than the men do,  she said, as others nearby nodded in agreement. Lopez spoke of how it is common in the city of about 100,000 people for husbands to help with household chores like cooking and washing dishes, in a country where such tasks are traditionally seen as the preserve of women. Men find the division of labor in the area  natural,  said male Juchitan surgeon Ovidio Pineda. Women and men  share the decisions, share the responsibilities,  he added. Martha Toledo, whose bar housed in a 200-year-old building collapsed in the quake, killing three clients, said the disaster would not crush Juchitan s spirit, as another aftershock sent her and others running to safety.      Women stand out here, in terms of work and intelligence and experience,  she said, wearing a traditional huipil top and standing near the pile of rubble that was once the bar.  We have to rebuild and rise like the phoenix,  she said, breaking out into a song in the Zapotec language with the chorus  I want to shout, I am alive!  ",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",1,4575

"HOLLYWOOD HYPOCRITE LEONARD DICAPRIO Jets LA Friends Across The World 6,000 Miles To Hear His Speech On GLOBAL WARMING","Sacrifice is for the peasants When Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio hosts a reception for a string of A-list stars, supermodels and wealthy philanthropists later this month, he will make an impassioned plea for more action to be taken on global warming.But instead of holding the event in Los Angeles, where most of his guests are based, they will fly halfway around the world to the glitzy French resort of St Tropez   at enormous cost to the environment.Last night, green campaigners were quick to criticise 41-year-old DiCaprio, who in February used his Best Actor acceptance speech at the Oscars to warn about the dangers posed by climate change.The reception   the grand-sounding Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Annual Gala To Fund Climate and Biodiversity Projects   will be held on July 20 at the Bertaud Belieu Vineyards on the French Riviera.Celebrities including Kate Hudson, Charlize Theron, Cate Blanchett, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Robert De Niro, Scarlett Johansson, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Spacey are all expected to attend, along with a host of international rock and pop stars, supermodels and tycoons.And while a table seating 12 people at the gala costs up to  125,000, the real price will be paid by the environment.If just one guest among the 500 invitees chooses to fly the 12,000-mile round trip from LA to St Tropez by private jet   a notoriously environmentally unfriendly way to travel   they will produce 86 tons of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas.Even those who use a scheduled flight will be responsible for releasing seven tons of CO2   leading green campaigners to ask why the event could not have been held in Hollywood or in St Tropez during May s Cannes Film Festival, when many of the guests would have been there anyway.Robert Rapier, an environmental analyst, said:  DiCaprio demonstrates why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow. It s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer. He believes that no sacrifice is necessary; just Government policies that can provide him with a solar-powered yacht or jet, or that give individuals low-cost renewable energy on a broad scale. One guest who attended last year s gala said:  It s basically a big party for Leo and his showbusiness friends and models. The models, of course, do not pay for tickets, and neither do the VIP guests   they get to have a nice big free party. Via: Daily Mail",politics,"Jul 2, 2016",0,2541

Iraqi forces launch offensive to recapture last town in Islamic State control,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi forces launched an offensive on Saturday to capture Rawa, the last remaining town under Islamic-State control, leaving the group s self-proclaimed caliphate on the verge of complete defeat. The capture of the town would mark the end of Islamic State s era of territorial rule over a so-called caliphate that it proclaimed in 2014 across vast swathes of Iraq and Syria. Syria s army declared victory over the militants on Thursday, after seizing the last substantial town on the border with Iraq. The army and its allies were still fighting Islamic State in desert areas near Albu Kamal, the last town the militant group had held in Syria. Two Iraqi infantry divisions and Sunni tribal forces are participating in the offensive to recapture the small town of Rawa and its surrounding areas along the border with Syria, the Joint Operations Command said in a statement.  Last week, Iraqi forces recaptured the larger town of al-Qaim, in what Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called  record time , leaving just a few small pockets of land in Islamic State s hands. Iraq has been carrying out its final campaign to crush the Islamic State caliphate while also mounting a military offensive in the north against the Kurds who held an independence referendum in September.

 GOP Senator Incapable Of Answering This Simple Question About Trump’s Border Wall (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s proposal to build a wall between the United States and Mexico is absolutely ridiculous. It s unnecessary, counter-productive, and an insult to our national neighbor. The fact that Trump thinks that Mexico should foot the bill for the mega-project serves as the cherry on top of the giant pile of bullsh*t that Trump has served to his supporters insisting that it is made of ice cream.The proposal is just one of many elephants in the room that the GOP is refusing to give any coherent opinion on. That s why when Republican Senator Bob Corker appeared on ABC s This Week, the show s host George Stephanopoulos pressed the Senator for some clarity on the matter.Here s a transcript of the exchange:GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, let me go ahead, let s talk about his ideas. You are the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and you ve said his call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration is not a serious proposal. The former head of the CIA Michael Hayden said this morning it s a recruiting tool for ISIS. If Donald Trump as president, moved to impose that ban would you support it or try to stop it?SEN. BOB CORKER No, I would not support it and I ve already issued statements to that effect and what I understand is he has stepped away from those statements.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he has said he still supports those statements. He s also said in every speech that he talks about building a wall on our border and getting Mexico to pay for it. Is that realistic and what would it do to our relations with Mexico?CORKER: You know, obviously we do need to have good relations with Mexico and Canada. We do. That s one of the things that makes our country in such a stable environment having two friends on our borders unlike many countries around the world. There is a security issue. I authored an amendment during the immigration debate that actually makes building a wall look like Ned in the first reader meaning it was even more difficult and by the way, I mean, a tougher security border measure   by the way, every Democrat in the Senate voted for that measure. So there s no question that we have agreement in our country that we need greater security. It s strongly bipartisan and I hope that we will implement that because it is a security threat.STEPHANOPOULOS: But is it realistic to expect Mexico to pay for the wall?CORKER: Again, I think people agree with that   what s that?STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it realistic for people to expect Mexico to pay for that wall?CORKER: Well, again, I don t want to get into a debate about the nuances of that. I mean it s a statement that he has made. I thought this interview was going to be more about the foreign policy arena. I think he has a tremendous opportunity there.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, our relations with Mexico is foreign policy.CORKER: Okay. Well, look, as to how the wall is paid for, that s something that Congress certainly will debate. My guess is there will be additional debates regarding how the actual security measures will be put in place but securing our border has been something that people on both sides of the aisle have supported for years and we need to do that and it s understandable that it s become an issue because it s lingered for so long. We had an opportunity to deal with this years ago. It wasn t dealt with. Needs to be dealt with now. And hopefully we ll move beyond that very quickly.Surprise, surprise. No clear answers on one of the most important topics of the election cycle. If you can t answer a simple question about what may become part of your party s platform   it might be a good sign that it is time to jump off the ship.These days, it s looking more and more like top members of the Republican Party are embarrassed to be a member of that party.

WATCH: FORMER TRUMP GIRLFRIEND Sets The Record Straight After NYT’s TWISTS Her Remarks To Make Trump Appear Disrespectful To Women,"It s interesting how much vitriol some women harbor for successful men who date beautiful women, as though it s somehow evil  and mysoginist to date beautiful women. If Trump only dated unattractive women would that somehow make him a better candidate? One of the women quoted in a New York Times article headlined  Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private  is pushing back Monday and saying that she was taken out of context and Trump never made her feel uncomfortable.The piece   which was published Saturday   begins with the line  Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes. It then continues with a scene illustrated by Brewer Lane about a 1990 pool party at Trump s Florida beach club. He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the mansion. He asked me if I had a swimsuit with me. I said no. I hadn t intended to swim. He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a swimsuit. But Brewer Lane disputed the way she is portrayed Monday in an interview with Fox & Friends. The New York Times told us several times that they would make sure my story that I was telling came across, they promised several times that they would do it accurately, they told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece and that my story would come across the way that I was telling it and honestly and it absolutely was not,  Brewer Lane said.  They did take quotes from what I said and they put a negative connotation on it. They spun it to where it appeared negative. I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump. Brewer Lane dated Trump and said that the presumptive Republican nominee  never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way, he never offended me in any way. WATCH HERE:  Obviously they feel like they need to do something to make him look bad or go along with their article,  Brewer Lane said. Why do you think the left   the mainstream media   is so obsessed with just creating this headline about how Donald Trump treats women?  host Ainsley Earhardt asked. I don t know. I think that they re just reaching for straws,  Brewer Lane said, adding that her manager has reached out to the reporter to say they would be telling her side of the story.

At the time Uranium One controlled roughly 20 percent of American uranium mining capacity.In fact, the evidence obtained by the Department of Justice and FBI, starting as early as 2008, paint a much different picture than that of recent reports regarding the confidential informant, William D. Campbell Jr., and his role. According to the documents, Campbell gained insight into Russia s strategic plans to gain global dominance in the uranium industry and to build a closer relationship with Obama administration officials.Read the full report at: SaraCarter.com",politics,"Nov 21, 2017",0,2230

White House does not rule out Sessions recusal on Russia probes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Sunday did not rule out that Attorney General Jeff Sessions may recuse himself from Justice Department investigations into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a deputy White House press secretary, said congressional investigations into possible Russian hacking of Democratic groups would have to run their course before Sessions needed to decide whether to step aside from the FBI probes. Sessions was a top adviser to President Donald Trump, a Republican, during the 2016 presidential campaign.  “I wasn’t saying that he shouldn’t recuse himself or that he should,” Sanders told ABC’s “This Week.” “My point is I don’t think we’re there yet. Let’s work through this process.” U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that Russia tried to help Trump win the White House by discrediting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her party through cyber attacks. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, expelled Russian diplomats in retaliation in December.  Moscow has denied the accusations. The FBI is investigating alleged Russian election-related hacking and financial transactions by Russian people and companies believed to have links to associates of Trump, according to current and former government officials. Trump has dismissed the controversy about ties between his aides and Russia as a “ruse” perpetrated by a hostile news media. “Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, three weeks into the new administration after disclosures surfaced that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Democrats have been pushing for an independent investigation into whether there were links between the Trump campaign team and Russian officials.  “The attorney general must recuse himself,” House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on ABC.  Republican lawmakers echoed the White House, saying the investigations must take their course. Senator Tom Cotton said it was premature to talk about a special prosecutor. “If we get down that road, that’s a decision that Attorney General Sessions can make at the time,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” ",politicsNews,"February 26, 2017 ",1,2564

Venezuela blasts Spain's Rajoy over 'repression' in Catalonia,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday slammed his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy for trying to halt a banned independence referendum in Catalonia, saying the conservative leader was a hypocrite for supporting Venezuela s opposition while cracking down on dissent at home.    Spain has been a vocal critic of leftist Maduro, accusing him of undermining Venezuela s democracy and plunging the country s 30 million people into suffering due to food and medicine shortages.    Maduro seized on the images of Spanish riot police bursting into polling stations across Catalonia on Sunday, confiscating ballot boxes and voting papers, as evidence that it is Rajoy who lacks democratic credentials.

Mariano Rajoy has chosen blood, sticks, blows, and repression against a noble people. Our hand goes out to the people of Catalonia. Resist, Catalonia! Latin America admires you,  added Maduro.

"German killer nurse's suspected death toll rises above 100, police say","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A German nurse serving a prison sentence for murdering two patients is suspected of killing a total of 102 people, more than previously known, police and public prosecutors said on Thursday.  That would make him Germany s deadliest serial killer if he was found guilty. The man, identified only as Niels H. under reporting rules, has admitted to deliberately injecting patients at two clinics in northern Germany with deadly drugs and then trying to revive them in order to play the hero. He has confessed to some killings, but police said in August that he could not remember all the details of his actions, prompting them to exhume the remains of 134 people with links to Niels H. to identify further victims. The investigation has now turned up evidence leading authorities to suspect Niels H. killed 38 people at a clinic in the northern German city of Oldenburg and 62 at one in nearby Delmenhorst, Oldenburg police and the city s public prosecutor s office said in a statement on Thursday. That is in addition to two counts of murder for which an Oldenburg court sentenced him in 2015. Police said in August he was suspected of killing 84 other people in addition to those two and that the toll may rise as toxicology reports were examined. It could rise further still, the statement said on Thursday, as police were seeking for the remains of some people to be exhumed in Turkey. It said the prosecutor s office was likely to bring charges against Niels H. early next year. Ten years ago, a German nurse was convicted of killing 28 elderly patients. He said he gave them lethal injections because he felt sorry for them. He was sentenced to life in prison. In Britain, Dr. Harold Shipman was believed to have killed as many as 250 people, most of them elderly and middle-aged women who were his patients. Known as Dr. Death, Shipman was sentenced to 15 life terms in 2000; he died prison in 2004, apparently a suicide. ",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",1,2018

Bodies of ambushed travelers found in eastern Congo: chief,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The bodies of 26 people believed killed after an ambush last week in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have been discovered, most of them with their hands tied and their necks broken, a local chief said on Sunday. The victims disappeared a week ago after they were ambushed by militants on a main road in North Kivu s restive Beni territory, where more than 800 people were killed in dozens of massacres between 2014 and 2016. The attack, which followed a lull this year, has revived questions about the state s ability to impose order over eastern borderlands wracked by ethnic tensions and competition for mineral resources. Congolese authorities and U.N. officials initially believed that about 20 civilians had disappeared after being attacked by armed assailants and were likely to have been killed. They were unable to locate the bodies for days, however, due to intense fighting. A group including officials from Congo s U.N. mission MONUSCO, the army, the Congolese Red Cross, and Congolese authorities traveled to the scene of the killings on Sunday.  In total, 26 people   three women, 22 civilian men and one Congolese soldier   were tied up and killed by breaking their necks,  Saambili Bamukoka, chief of Beni s Watalinga chiefdom, told Reuters. A Congolese military spokesman had earlier confirmed that the bodies had been discovered near the road, but did not know how many there were.  Bodies were found in a state of decomposition,  said local army spokesman Mak Hazukay, adding that the road remained closed to civilian traffic.  We must first have the time to secure the surrounding area.   The day after the attack on the travelers, militants assaulted two nearby military bases, killing two U.N. peacekeepers and injuring 18 others. The army and U.N. peacekeeping mission blamed the raids on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near the border. Authorities have also accused the ADF of carrying out nearly all the massacres of the past three years. But independent and separate U.N. experts say several armed groups as well as national army commanders have been involved in the killings as they vie for influence in Congo s lawless eastern borderlands.  Millions died in regional wars that ravaged eastern Congo between 1996-2003 and spawned dozens of armed groups that continue to prey on local populations.  ",worldnews,"October 15, 2017 ",1,2471
Trump says Iran must stop funding and training 'terrorists and militias' immediately,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Iran must immediately stop its financial and military support for “terrorists and militias” and he reiterated that it never be permitted to possess atomic arms. “Most importantly, the United States and Israel can declare with one voice that Iran must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias, and it must cease immediately,” Trump said in public remarks at a meeting in Jerusalem with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. The United States brands Iran a “state sponsor of terrorism”. It says Tehran’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, Houthi rebels in Yemen’s civil war and the Hezbollah Shi’ite political party and militia in Lebanon have helped destabilize the Middle East.  Trump flew to Israel from Riyadh earlier in the day, on the second leg of his first overseas trip since entering office in January. In his speech at Rivlin’s official residence, Trump said he was deeply encouraged by his conversations with Muslim world leaders in Saudi Arabia. “Many expressed their resolve to help end terrorism and the spread of radicalization. Many Muslim nations have already taken steps to begin following through on this commitment,” he said.   “There is a growing realization among your Arab neighbors that they have common cause with you in the threat posed by Iran,” Trump told Rivlin.

UK Brexit bill not scheduled for debate in parliament next week,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s parliament will not discuss the key European Union withdrawal bill next week, the leader of the lower House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said on Thursday, amid concerns the government is struggling to manage divisions over its contents. The bill is at the heart of the government s Brexit strategy. It will transpose EU law into British law at the point of Britain s departure from the bloc and repeal the 1972 act of parliament which made it a member. Lawmakers have proposed hundreds of changes to the bill, some of which have enough backing from lawmakers within Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservative Party to defeat the government - something that would cause May a major headache and question her ability to complete the Brexit process.  There is nothing odd or anything to fear from this slight pause,  Leadsom told lawmakers. She promised them there would be eight days of debate on the bill but did not say when they would start. The BBC reported on Wednesday that the government might delay the bill s passage through parliament until next month because of political divisions.     The bill has already passed its first stage of the legislative process, but is expected to face a stiffer challenge when it is next debated. It has been criticised by lawmakers who say it gives the government too much power to amend EU laws as they are transferred onto the British statute book. Others want safeguards to ensure the government cannot walk away from negotiations without parliament s approval. ",worldnews,"October 19, 2017 ",1,1596

" Trump’s Salary Donation Is Just Bullsh*t PR, And Here’s Why","Amateur president Donald Trump is donating his second-quarter salary to the Department of Education, the White House announced Wednesday. During her daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was besieged with questions about Trump s Twitter announcement saying that he s banning transgender Americans from serving in the military, told everyone about the $100,000 donation. Huckabee Sanders then handed the check signed by the former reality show star to Education Secretary Betsy Devos, a billionaire.Now, while they may seem generous on the surface, Trump has proposed slashing the Education Department by $9.2 billion. That s a 14 percent reduction so $100,000 is a mere drop in the bucket.And while he s profiting from his businesses, typically every weekend when the 71-year-old needs a break, he threw his relatively meager salary at the very department he s stripping funding from.DeVos announced that the money would go toward hosting a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics camp for children at the department. We want to encourage as many students as possible to pursue STEM fields,  DeVos said.Trump's donation to Dept of Education: $100,000.Spending cut to education in Trump's proposed 2018 budget: $9,200,000,000.  Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) July 26, 2017Trump donated his first quarter salary of about $78,000 to the National Park Service. Just like Huckabee Sanders did today, Sean Spicer made a big show of handing over the Trump s salary to benefit the National Park Service, but his budget slashes the Department of the Interior by 12 percent.Trump s first paycheck of $78,333 went to a department he planned to slash by $1.6 billion in funding. We see a pattern here!Shortly before Trump s inauguration, Mar-a-Lago doubled its annual membership fee to $200,000. He s literally profiting from his  presidency  by using his Florida resort for official government business. Each weekend Trump spends at one of his businesses, the visit generates revenue for the alleged president. And we, the taxpayers, are footing the bill.But hey, he gave departments which he s slashed funding for his paycheck, so he s a really good guy, right?

ABOUT TIME! House Republicans Move To Charge Hillary With PERJURY For LYING UNDER OATH Before Congress [VIDEO],"Didn t America have to suffer through a high profile perjury case for another Clinton not so many years ago? Oh yeah that was Bill Clinton who was actually IMPEACHED for LYING to a grand jury. Is there a more corrupt, self-serving power-driven couple in America?  WASHINGTON, D.C. Today, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (UT-03) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (VA-06) sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia requesting an investigation into whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton committed perjury and made false statements when testifying under oath before Congress.The letter states: The evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton s use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony. In light of those contradictions, the Department should investigate and determine whether to prosecute Secretary Clinton for violating statutes that prohibit perjury and false statements to Congress, or any other relevant statutes. Background:During a July 5, 2016 hearing before the House Oversight Committee, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated the truthfulness of Secretary Clinton s testimony before Congress was not within the scope of the FBI s investigation. According to Director Comey the Department of Justice requires a criminal referral from Congress to initiate an investigation into Secretary Clinton s congressional testimony.Additionally, Chairman Chaffetz sent a letter to Director Comey requesting the FBI s full investigative file from its review of former Secretary Clinton s use of an authorized private email server.Chairman Goodlatte sent a letter to Director Comey pressing for more information about the FBI s investigation and also led a letter signed by over 200 members of Congress demanding answers from FBI Director Comey regarding the many questions surrounding his announcement that he does not recommend federal prosecution against former Secretary Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information through private email servers.Full text of letter:The Honorable Channing D. Phillips U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia 555 Fourth Street NW Washington, D.C. 20530Dear Mr. Phillips:We write to request an investigation to determine whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton committed perjury and made false statements during her testimony under oath before congressional committees.While testifying before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on July 7, 2016, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated the truthfulness of Secretary Clinton s testimony before Congress was not within the scope of the FBI s investigation.

"THE BIG QUESTION: Why Do We STILL Take 1,000 Somali Refugees A MONTH?","Please understand that our government is unable to know the exact number of Somalis we re taken in through all the different ways the government imports them. The number above does not include all the Somalis who got in to the US through other means including the Diversity Visa Lottery (50K admitted in the name of diversity), those who received student visas and disappeared into the American woodwork, are here protected by Temporary Protected Status, or who came across one of our borders and applied for asylum (or simply disappeared) over the last 3 decades.And, in order for there to be only 129,000 people of Somali ancestry here it would require us to believe some who came to the US left the country, that a whole heck of a lot of them died while they weren t having babies for nearly 35 years! It is nuts!When the government does census counts do they rely completely on who is willing to answer surveys, or do they make some attempt to look at government-held numbers about those who entered the country? Apparently they rely on Somalis willing to tell them something!In addition to the 136,376 through FY16, we have admitted 4,478 in the last 4 months and 19 days.And, we pick up Somalis all over the world, and I can assure you that vetting the wandering Somalis is impossible.Here is where that 4,478 were placed since October 1, 2016 (according to Wrapsnet): Please check out Wrapsnet if you want to dig into your state or any other numbers. It s a great resource! The top five states  welcoming  Somalis since October 1, 2016 are Minnesota (609), New York (397), Ohio (306), Kentucky (283) and Arizona (276). Virtually all Somalis are Muslims. WHERE ARE THE CONGRESSMEN FROM THESE TOP FIVE STATES? RAND PAUL, JOHN MCCAIN and others have been silent on the effort for the UN to push Somalis into our towns! And, of all the ethnic groups entering the US right now, Somalis (I believe) lead the pack in the number of terrorist attacks or attempted terrorist attacks, or who have been arrested and convicted of helping to support jihadists in some form or another.Frankly, there is absolutely no reason for the US to take in more Somalis!

"China grants economic aid to Djibouti, site of overseas military base","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Thursday offered loans to Djibouti, the site of its first overseas military base, as the Horn of Africa state s leader told President Xi Jinping he considered himself a great friend of the Asian giant.  With a population of less than one million, Djibouti has long punched above its weight, thanks to a strategic location on the Gulf of Aden, one of the world s busiest shipping routes linking Europe to Asia and the Middle East. China formally opened the base, which it calls a logistics facility, on Aug. 1, the 90th birthday of the People s Liberation Army. Djibouti also hosts large U.S. and French bases.  Djibouti was politically stable, Xi told its president, Ismail Omar Guelleh, at a meeting in Beijing s Great Hall of the People.     China sets great store by its relations with Djibouti,  he added.  Guelleh, who has been in power since 1999, said he considered himself a  great friend of China s  and could not count the number of times he had visited.  Djibouti is known for being a country of peace, exchanges and meetings,  Guelleh said.  I would like to recall the geostrategic position of Djibouti and its importance in this part of the world as an island of stability for Asia, Africa and the Middle East.   The two, who did not mention the military base in comments to reporters, later oversaw the signing of a framework pact for preferential loans. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong declined to reveal the amount of loans offered, saying he could not remember.  In this area both countries have always had good cooperation,  Chen told reporters. Xi and Guelleh did discuss the military base, Chen added.  What I want to stress is that China building a logistics base in Djibouti benefits China to even better fulfill its naval protection, peace-keeping, disaster relief and other international work,  he said. The base will be used to resupply navy ships participating in peacekeeping, humanitarian and anti-piracy missions off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia, in particular. China also has deep economic interests in Djibouti.     Last week, China s POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Ltd signed a memorandum of understanding to invest $4 billion in a natural gas project in Djibouti. In January, the government launched construction of a project billed as Africa s largest free trade zone, as part of China s massive Belt and Road infrastructure initiative stretching to Asia, Europe and beyond.

TREY GOWDY ON CROOKED DNC: ‘There May Be Something The DNC Didn’t Want Law Enforcement to See In Hacked Server [Video],"Rep. Trey Gowdy was full of sarcasm (rightfully so) during comments about why the DNC didn t turn over its hacked computer server to authorities. The puzzling thing that raised red flags is that the organization said it never received federal assistance causing people to question whether the DNC had something it  didn t want law enforcement to see. Congressman Gowdy spoke with FOX News  Martha MacCallum about why the DNC did not turn over its server to the DHS or FBI officials who could have helped to prevent future hackings:The DNC was hacked during the 2016 election and  emails were published by WikiLeaks. JKeh Johnson, former DHS Secretary, testified yesterday that the DNC didn t need help after the hacks.Then this shocker after Johnson s testimony,  Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that while she was chair of the DNC, she was never contacted by any federal agency, including DHS and the FBI, about the hack.Gowdy goes on to refer to his career as a prosecutor by implying that it appeared as though the DNC had something to hide: Let me hazard a wild guess: that there may be something else on that server they didn t want law enforcement to see?
