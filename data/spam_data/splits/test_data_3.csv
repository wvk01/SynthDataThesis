Re: Hash Key is a Null Value,"Hi

as far as I know hash keys must be strings.
So there simply can't be a undef() as a hashkey.

to prove what I said:

% perl -MData::Dumper -le '$hash{undef()} = ""foo""; $hash{""""} = ""bar""; print Dumper \%hash'
 $VAR1 = {
          '' => 'bar'
        };

foreach is dead, long live for.

Use named values in your for loop:

for my $h (@arr) {
    for my $key (sort keys %$h) {
        print ""$key = $h->{$key}\n""
    }

It doesn't look strange, but your code only works with the first
element of @DNS so it is pointless.  If you want to say stop_it(@DNS)
and actually do something with the the other values in @DNS you will
need a loop inside the sub:

sub stop_it {
    for my $vm (@_) {
        my $state = `/usr/bin/vmware-cmd ""$vm"" getstate -q`;
        .
        .
        .
    }
}

If you really only want to work with the first value in @DNS then you should say

stop_it($DNS[0]);

to avoid confusing people.

yesterday afternoon i spoke with walt madro , sr . vice president of global gas and lng , regarding marathon ' s decision not to pursue a marketing / trading relationship with enron . walt further clarified marathon ' s poisition :
marathon is in final negotiations to acquire a firm with both upstream assets and a small , niche marketing arm .
steve lowden told walt to hold off on the negotiations with enron because of the acquisition of this firm and the potential duplication of marketing compentencies . ( ? ? )
i asserted that this firm , even if acquired , does not have the premier gas and power franchise like enron and walt agreed .
as such , walt will contact me when the deal is completed - expected date is before the end of the year .
i will stay in contact with walt and try to identify the firm being acquired .
ultimately , i do not like how this "" smells . "" i would like to have a conversation with lowden because the opportunity cost of not having a marketing / trading relationship with enron versus acquiring this small firm ( albeit receiving strategic upstream assets ) , i can not compute intellectually . do you agree ?

Re: [R] Increasing precision of rgenoud solutions,"Hi Paul,

Solution.tolerance is the right way to increase precision.  In your
example, extra precision *is* being obtained, but it is just not
displayed because the number of digits which get printed is controlled
by the options(""digits"") variable.  But the requested solution
precision is in the object returned by genoud().

For example, if I run

a  a$par
[1] 0.7062930 0.7079196

But if I set options(""digits""=12), and without rerunning anything I check
a$par again, I observe that:

> a$par
[1] 0.706293049455 0.707919577559

Cheers,
Jas.

subject : get together this coming tuesday ?
vince / kim :
i am flying to houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming tuesday sometime for 1 / 2 hour or
so . i really want to reinitiate the conversations marketpoint was having
with john goodpasture and you , and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift . john was quite
positive about the idea of enron acquiring marketpoint narg through license ,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you .
would this coming tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys ? if
so , please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 . i think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run narg
and the long run narg in which you were interested ( not to mention our power
model ) . the progress is noticeable since you saw it . both long and short
term narg are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from venezuelan lng , north american lng import terminals and
term , gas basis calculations , trading support , power plant development ,
gas - to - power price spreads in key markets , veracity of heat rate trades ,
bank financings , storage field evaluation , and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs .
i really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again . i think narg can help you become even more
successful , and i look forward to working with you .
we have a new office address and new phone number as well . ( we move in may

I have historically backported new versions to debian stable, as the
Debian policy is to never upgrade packages in stable but just do
security updates or fix bugs in that version.

Etch is the new stable release so I should stop providing packages for
Sarge and start to provide packages for Etch.

I am not yet sure I have time to do this. If I can't I will discontinue
the service of providing packages for Debian Stable (Etch currently).

 What is HGH Life?

 HGH Life is our patented formula of Human Growth Hormone, amino acids,
and the most-potent growth factors, all in one pill. It was designed with
anti-aging in mind, and has been noted for increased energy and alertness,
stronger muscles and bones, better looking skin, increased libido and overall
beneficial health benefits in America and abroad for the last several years.

How does HGH Life work?

HGH Life supplements the ever decreasing amount of growth hormone secreted
by the pituitary gland as we get older. The result is youthful feeling
and appearance, increased energy, memory and metabolism, stronger immune
system function, increased tissue repair, cell replacement, and bone strength,
and healthier skin, nails and teeth. In other words, it creates an overall,
more youthful you!

Buy HGH Life and become become immune to the passage of time!

I need some comment on this patch:

With this patch, we no longer output the children of the event context
as leaks (and likewise to the shared schema).

Currently, these are a very useful view into the long-term memory use
(which seems quite high), but these are not leaks, and do rather get in
the way of seeing actual leaked memory on the NULL context.=20

Thoughts?

There are more simple ways to find out, see charnames and perlunitut.
http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?charnames
http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlunitut

I would first convert to a common base, like UTF-8, before trying to
match strings. Are you talking about raw mail messages? Consider
SpamAssassin and custom rules.

there will be a story in tomorrow ' s financial times about our trading position in europe . myself and john sherriff spoke with london - based ft reporter andy taylor .
andy is a long - standing contact and an enron supporter . he spoke with various players in the european market and although they were supportive , they were also giving the impression that business with enron had dropped 90 % .
this is not the case and it was therefore important to refute this . i ' m comfortable with how the interview went . john made a point of saying how supportive counterparties had been and we did not discuss anything beyond our european trading position .
will forward the coverage tomorrow .
hope all is well and that you had an enjoyable thanksgiving .

This would seem to be the problem, also where did you learn that you
should put & on the front of your subroutine calls?  I am curious
because I keep seeing people do it without understanding what it is
for.  Way back, in the dawn of time, it was the way to call
subroutines, but it then it changed to just
""deleteposter_file(@row);"".

from perldoc perlsub
        To call subroutines:

           NAME(LIST);    # & is optional with parentheses.
           NAME LIST;     # Parentheses optional if predeclared/imported.
           &NAME(LIST);   # Circumvent prototypes.
           &NAME;         # Makes current @_ visible to called subroutine.

Note the extra bits that happen when you call it with &?  They can be
handy when you expect them and trying to achieve a specific effect,
but they can cause problems for the unwary:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

sub i_have_a_prototype($$$) {
        print ""I can only be called with three parameters,"",
                ""they are $_[0], $_[1], and $_[2]\n""
}

eval qq{ i_have_a_prototype(1);       } or print ""$@\n"";
eval qq{ i_have_a_prototype(1, 2);    } or print ""$@\n"";
i_have_a_prototype(1, 2, 3);
&i_have_a_prototype(6); #oops

Also

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

sub outer {
        if ($_[0] eq 'none') {
                &inner;
        } else {
                &inner(""arg1"", ""arg2"");
        }
}

#this is not treadsafe, but the first call
#sets up foobar, and all subsequent calls
#use foobar
sub inner {
        if (@_ == 0) {
                print ""no args, so setup foobar\n"";
                return;
        }

        #if we get here then args were passed
        #and foobar should setup
        local $"" = "", "";
        print ""I was call like this inner(@_)\n"";
}

outer('none'); #setup foobar

The spots file is not necessary. It is used, however, to define  
individual spots or classes of spots of interests, either to remove  
from normalisation, as control spots, or just to highlight in  
different colours on your plots.

In windows I recommend you install limmaGUI from:

http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI/

go to section 2.3.1, for a binary that will install R 2.1.1 and  
limmaGUI with all dependent packages.

I hope this helps

Jose

Re: [sugar] Stirme initial code,"Hi list,
Note this announcement is a bit rushed, we've barely got some proof of
concept GUI and we've still got lots to do and lots to decide, like:

 * Start working on sugar integration
 * Start studying the mesh API
 * Decide on a persistence scheme, probably the journal.
 * Start coding the voting mechanism.
 * Further develop the GUI

So most of our work is still on the spec and we're still getting
familiar with the OLPC APIs and its possibilities.

Acording to our roadmap:

""The first milestone (July 9th) will provide basic voting
functionality, that is the ability to log into a voting centre
remotely and pick an election from a list, then actually cast a vote
on it. Voting centre functionality will be minimal at this point, and
GPG support will be attached after this milestone. The goal is to
provide a taste of what is possible and work out the rough (but
important) edges from then on. Release early, release often.""

So today we officially start, wish us luck,

It is a challenge for us to work with such an inspired team on such an
inspired goal and I hope we're up for it, at least our spirits are up.

Sebastian Silva

my names are mr martins olusegun , i worked with union bank of nigeria

branch , lagos nigeria . i have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality .
on january 6 , 1998 a foreign consultant and contractor with the
nigerianrail way corporation mr . theophilous baker made a numbered time
fixeddeposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 4 . 5 m ( four
million , fivehundred united
states
dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent aroutine notification
in accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding address but got no
reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally ,
we discovered from his contract employers nigerian railway corporation
that mr . theophilous baker died in anautomobile accident .
on further investigation , we found out that he died without making a
will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore
made further investigations and discovered that mr . theophilous baker
did notdeclare any next of kin or relations in all his official
documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank .
no one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the law of
my country , at the expiration of 7 years the money will revert to the
ownership of the state ( government ) if nobody applies to claim the
fund . this prompted me to contact you . i want to front you as the next of kin

subject : houston gas & power controls / standards assessment
as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement
methodology for the london office .
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash
collections are timely )
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date
with exceptions noted )
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward
to seeing you next week .",0

Ah, it's not limited to those. Any character string would do (guru 
caveats aside).  
I suspect my narrow answer to your question might lead you astray, 
perhaps you should cut to the chase and ask how to get your data file 
into which  function in evir . . .

Cheers, Mike.

india database,"jim / wade ,
as you are aware , i have been working with vince ' s group on the henwood model
data . the target was to have data on all india plants collected by jan . 15 th .
we all know that getting power out o maharashtra holds the key to being able
to solve the dabhol challenge . with all of your help , this model can become
the tool that tells us exactly how that can be done , and at what prices .
we are a substantial part of the way there on data collection , and have got
data of some 1500 plants across the country . the spreadsheet for the same is
attached . this will help you answer any questions that come up in calls
about the various plants . please note that we are located in the western
region , or wr in the spreadsheet . we will be further scrubbing the data and
getting more recent and accurate information , especially on maharashtra over
the next 2 - 3 days .
the henwood team will be in india on sunday , and will compare notes with the
team here . i am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it will
do .
wade - it would be good if a broad section of the team attend , including
neil , yourself and mohan . i will talk to you about a convenient time for you
in this regard .
neil & mohan - over the next week ( monday and tuesday ) i will need some time
from vivek , anshuman , ravi , and a few others , to interact with the henwood
team . i will be abliged if you can make that possible .
the first phase of model runs ( which will be done by jan . end ) will just give
us some more basic information , but i will need all of your inputs in order
to ask the right questions . the idea is that as we go along , this model will
be used to answer all types of management questions concerning dabhol , and
power evacuation out of maharashtra .
this will be critical for the team going forward .
regards ,

re :,"john :
thanks for the e - mail . i wasn ' t trying to be critical of anyone specifically , and i think dick is doing an admirable job . i will give him high marks at prc . however , one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is avici . do you think that at prc , this "" loss "" of value , which does not show up in a p / l since it is hedged by raptor , should be taken into account when we evaluate the person ? my point is only that each of these investments are "" positions "" that should be "" owned "" by someone , like a book . hickerson didn ' t get evaluated on avici because it didn ' t show up in a p / l ( even though he lost a lot of value ) . what do we do with garland ? now it has lost a lot of value again . if dick could sell an asset for a 10 % loss today , but doesn ' t , and we eventually lose 30 % upon disposition , how do you evaluate the performance ?

good morning ,
attached , please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly .
also note that on september 10 and 11 , csfb will host a power generation
supply chain conference at the plaza hotel in new york city . the power
generators will speak on the morning of 9 / 11 . companies presenting include :
cpn , mir , nrg , orn , rri and te .
1 . ipps rise 3 . 9 % last week our ipp composite rose 3 . 9 % , outperforming
both the nasdaq ( + 2 . 7 % ) and the s & p 500 ( + 2 . 0 % ) . this was the strongest
performance for our composite since the second week of july . calpine , which
was up 10 . 9 % , was the strongest performer in the group . global power
equipment group was the weakest performer , falling 3 . 4 % .
2 . recognition of attractive valuations and cpn conference call boost stock
prices we attribute last week ' s performance to a growing recognition that
the group is simply oversold . indeed , on average the pure play ipps are
trading at 11 . 6 x 2002 eps , which represents a 40 % + valuation compression
year to date . more immediately , we believe a conference call hosted by
calpine on monday ( 8 / 20 ) helped ease investor concerns regarding the
supply / demand outlook for the sector and the ability of power generators to
attract capital to grow their businesses .
3 . calpine hosting final special topic conference call on tuesday ( 8 / 28 ) ,
calpine will conclude its special topic conference call series with a
discussion of the california power market . the call will take place at 2 pm
edt . the dial - in number is 877 / 692 - 2137 . on the call , management will
provide a regulatory update and describe the steps it has taken to respond
to the power shortages in the state .
4 . california windfall profits tax bill resurfaces today ( 8 / 27 ) , the
california assembly revenue and taxation committee will consider sb 1 xx - the
power generator windfall profits tax bill . importantly , while earlier
versions of the bill implied that the tax would be retroactive and applied
to power sales going back to january 1 , 2001 , the current version of the
bill suggests that the tax will not be implemented until early 2002 . in
addition , an internal analysis of the bill done by the assembly revenue and
taxation committee suggests that the bill could be subject to several legal
challenges if it is passed .

Dear valued member.
United American Health Association warns you about the risks you run while purchasing your meds on the Internet. Please, read this letter to the end.
There are so many online drugstores on the Web today  but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds  so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills.
Dont hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning the information provided.
--
If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.

I see that I should have also patched config/gen/revision.pm to eliminate this line:

    my $entries  = $Parrot::Revision::svn_entries;
...
        SVN_ENTRIES => $entries

The patch attached accomplishes this.

I've been using bzr for the 3.0-ctdb tree, and found that it works
quite fast as long as you use rspush for pushing, and use rsync for
initial checkouts (using any other local tree for rsync to feed off
for the initial pull).

Code Comments/Tips - Can this code be better?,"I got an input source that got records of fixed number of lines, eg
Name, Address, Age, Phone, Cell
I'm not interested in Age or Cell.
I'm doing something along the lines of the following. Can I do better?

my @lines = qw/name address age phone cell end/;
my %process = {name=>1, address=>1, phone=>1, end=>1};
my $i = 0;
my $name;
my %hash;
while( ) {
	$name = $_ if($lines[$i] eq 'name');
	next unless($process{$lines[$i]});
	$hash{$name}{$lines[$i]} = $_;
} continue {
	$i = ($i++) % (#$lines + 1);
}

One part that really irks me is the hash for listing what lines get processed.
I suppose I can process everything and have a qw// list of what parts
of the hash I want to use at a later point of the code...

Thanks

Dear valued member!
United American Health Association warns you about the risks you run while purchasing your meds on the Internet. Please, read this letter to the end.
No matter how wide the choice of meds is, always try to cling to generic ones. Moreover, it would be better to purchase them from reliable pharmacies, such as USDrugs. Dont forget that the pharmacy you shop at should be licensed.

enron networks offsite,"hi - i just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday .
three people spoke at the meeting - jeff mcmahon , louise and philippe . there
was a lot of attention given to enrononline and it ' s success . greg whalley
spoke via satellite from london . the basic theme was what it is going to
take to survive in today ' s fast moving markets and how we are going to get
there , and that in five years all businesses will be internet companies or
not companies at all . . . . .
greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand
existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do
this but us because of our financial capabilities , reputation , and it
resources .
louise went over statistics , products offered , etc . on enrononline .
philippe discussed all the it projects in the works - the key one for ena was
enhancement of deal capture , valuation and settlements ( no surprises
there ! ) . one other common theme was streamlining our current systems . he
also confirmed the fact that we were moving from lotus notes to exchange , and
discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our
equipment ( and the ability to keep the room cool ) so they were looking to
ardmore for this .
jeff m . stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on
inefficiencies in the market , and get into other industries ( e . g . mg metals
in europe ) . he also stated that enron was going to venture capitalists for
financial support and backing . of course , this means that enron will have to
give up some control , but it leads to increased deal flow , market share and
new ideas . . . . he said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of
$ 1 b - most likely in q 3 .
i tried to capture the main topics , let me know if you have any questions !

[R] Differences of correlations testing in R,"Good morning everybody,

I need to compare intercorrelations between variables.

My data were collected from 4 samples (with various number of subject)
containing 4 variables scores.

Some of my hypothesis are about the strength of relations
(the sign doesn't matter) between variables across samples.

I have such correlation matrix:

A
B ab
C ac bc
D ad bd cd
  A  B  C  D

my hypothesis are:

|ad|>|ac|
|ad|>|ab|
|ad|>|bd|
|ad|>|cd|
|bc|>|ac|
|bc|>|cd|
|bc|>|ab|
|bc|>|bd|

ac,bd > 0
ab,bc,cd,ad < 0


I would like to make above comparisons across the samples
I'm only interested in whether the pattern is replicated in all
samples not in the differences between them.

Is it possible to do it in R? (I'm newbie)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Confirmed.  Interestingly, the problem looks like a Key PMC somewhere gets 
garbage collected inappropriately.

I tried various tricks to mark the call_state's PMC as live, but nothing fixed 
anything except for this patch, which hides the problem.

Now I know that storing a PMC in a data structure that the GC doesn't check 
during mark and sweep is a problem, but liberal use of parrot_register_pmc() 
didn't fix things either.

[R] how to estimate dose from respond given drc package result,"Dear all,

I can use the very nice drc package (multdrc()) to model and plot a  
dataframe containing dose and response values. I can also use  
predict.drc() to yield response values given a dose. I need to do the  
opposite, estimate a dose given the response. The general predict  
documentation seems to say that this is possible, but it does not  
appear that predict.drc has that capability. This makes sense because  
it is easy to compute y values from x values, given the fitted  
equation, but it is hard to do the opposite.

It seems that I need to do some kind of successive approximation. Is  
there a package that takes a multdrc generated model and estimates  
dose given response?

Thank you all for your time,

John

forcefsck question,"Hi, I have read that as root you can touch /forcefsck to force fsck run
when your system reboots.  If I use this option does it run in it's most
strongest mode fixing all errors or is that just a check with no fixes?  I
had to use a rescue mode CD to run fsck on /dev/hda1 as my jurnal some how
got messed up and mount would not mount it, that is why I am asking this
question as if fsck runs first, I did not see any messages about it
running, I think it was in the initrd.  It was just after speakup started
talking, the system frose.  What is the best way to fix the jurnal with
out using another CD?

Gewinn mit Filmunternehmen erzielen,"Meine Damen und Herren

Wie es bekannt ist, bewegt sich der Aktienkurs bei kleinen Gesellschaften viel staerker und schneller, als bei großen Gesellschaften. Da reicht ein neues Produkt und der Aktienkurs explodiert.
Die Kronos Media AG (WKN A0LEK1 / ISIN CH 0027905527), mit Sitz in der Schweiz und Tochter- und Partnerunternehmen in Deutschland, investiert in Produktion von Filmen genauso wie in neue Ideen fuer interaktive und mobile Inhalte in einem schnell wachsenden Markt: Fernsehen, Kino, Internet- und Handyfilme usw.   
Medien, die gute Geschichten erzaehlen, erreichen ihre Zuschauer und Zuhoerer weltweit. Geschichten, bei denen man Anteil nehmen, mitfuehlen, mitzittern kann. Die Fachleute hinter Kronos Media verfuegen ueber langjaehrige Expertise im Bereich von Filmgestaltung und Produktion, Medienaktionen und weltweiten Vertrieb.
Am 19.Mai fand die Premiere von einem spannenden Film ueber Hannibals Elefanten statt - uberraschendes Projekt: ob der legendaere Zug vom beruehmten Feldherren ueber die Alpen wirklich war, ob es ueberhaupt moeglich waere.  Kronos Media beteiligt sich an diesem international koprodizierten Projekt aus der Serie Rebels of History.  Es ist schon bekannt geworden, dass die naechsten Serien aus dieser Reihe kommen.

   When the expected behavior of a block of code is to throw warnings,
   then tests should be written to make sure those warnings are, in
   fact, being thrown.  We can do this in our Perl 5- based tests by
   using Parrot::IO::Capture::Mini to capture the warnings, then using
   Test::More::like() to determine if we got the warnings we expected.
   In r18763 I took this approach and applied the following patch to
   t/tools/pmc2cutils/05-gen_c.t . . .

This seems like a lot of trouble just to keep dead code in the codebase.
Is there some reason not to yank the useless methods?

the secret of life is honesty and fair dealing . if you can fake that , you ' ve got it made . - groucho marx ( 1890 - 1977 ) . from that day on there were new rules in my classroom . each student was to have an adult ' communication partner ' at the computer . this adult was to sit with the child , not saying a word until the student stopped and looked at the adult or in some other way indicated that communication was desired . then the adult was only to encourage the student by saying the word , nodding the headand smiling . the student was allowed to continue his or her learning . when the student imitated a word , the adult was to respond appropriately . no questions were allowed during this beginning phase . the students were just learning to talk . .

i got your note regarding the estimated costs in cgs physical statement of work . according to my knowledge , the indirect expense includes overheads of hr , corp , accounting , tax , legal , infrastructure , etc . the estimated indirect expense of the project for ea is $ 281 , 415 . there are direct expenses associated with steve stock ' s and beth perlman ' s cost centers . the estimated direct expense of the project for ea is $ 184 , 107 . the estimated cost center & indirect expense for ea is the sum of those two types of expenses and is equal to $ 465 , 522 that is presented in the document .
therefore , i am afraid that my estimated project costs presented in the document do include all corporate and cost center overheads . would you please let me know if i missed anything else ?

Somu you need to tell us exactly what match you want, otherwise we can't
tell you whether something will work or not. Are you simply checking whether
the input string contains all of the match characters? I would forget about
sorting the input string and do it as in the program below. But please
explain what the problem is instead of asking how to implement a solution
which may not be optimal.

HTH,

Re: [SAMBA4] shorten leak report?,"Andrew,

 > With this patch, we no longer output the children of the event context
 > as leaks (and likewise to the shared schema).

I haven't found the leak report on exit all that useful, so I think
you're probably right.

When looking for memory leaks I tend to add in custom code that dumps
a talloc tree at a particular point in the code (usually to a file in
/tmp) then examining that manually.

I think it's a very difficult problem to handle completely
automatically. Probably the most successful automated leak detection
is the one we have for ldb, but even that has lots of false positives.

This does make more sense than the pointer to an enum. Though, it's 
still true that the caller doesn't really need to know all the 
alternatives for looking up a library. It could all be encapsulated

Perhaps a better approach is to squirrel away an MD5 of the source file 
last time it was checked (or remembers all MD5s of all good source 
files, irrespective of whether they actually exist in the repository as 
latest versions -- that would help with the Git issues). Of course, this 
would mean checking in a generated file; but perhaps that could be done 
by a robot that sweeps the tree once a day or so.

An alternative to checking in the MD5 list would be to use a queryable 
server; but some people work offline or have high-latency links, so 
perhaps that doesn't work so well.",0

memo indicates that a lot of work has been done , the reader might want to
know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results .
you will of course describe everything in your presentation , but given that

I may be not totally uptodate with the recent implementation changes. But I've 
repeatedly urged a clear separation between variables and values. Obviously 
the mixture of these is still the current way to go. Anyway: I'd translate 
above code to the following pseudocode:

  .var '$a' = .value '.sub ... '
  .var '$b' = .var '$a'
  .var '$a' = .value '4'

There is no need for any morph or such operation. Sometimes the implementation 
needs an additional indirection though, but there are already a lot of these 
indirections (think of the pmc_ext or even data pointers in the PMC). 

All values can be shared and are readonly, well, variables are changing. Thx 
to listening.

sources : edison reworking bond sale
by jonathan stempel
new york ( reuters ) - edison international ( nyse : eix - news ) , in a last - ditch bid to stay solvent , is restructuring a $ 1 . 2 billion junk bond sale because investors are afraid of getting caught in a second big california utility bankruptcy , bond market analysts and investors said on tuesday .
edison , the parent of cash - strapped utility southern california edison ( news - web sites ) , is considering trimming its bond sale and adding a bank term loan , the analysts and investors said .
rosemead , california - based edison needs cash this week as it struggles with california ' s power crisis , analysts said . the company is trying to rid itself of debt maturing this year , including a fully drawn down $ 618 million bank credit line expiring saturday .
the seven - year secured notes being sold by mission energy holding co . have not found enough buyers despite carrying yields as high as 13 . 5 percent , analysts said . that ' s more than four percentage points above the recent 9 . 33 percent yield on a typical junk - rated electric utility bond , according to merrill lynch & co .
` ` we were hearing it was significantly undersubscribed around midday when the deal was scheduled to price , so the assumption is it will resurface in another form , probably much cheaper and restructured , ' ' said john atkins , a corporate bond analyst at ideaglobal . com , a new york - based research firm .
in the utility ' s semi - weekly conference call with holders of defaulted socal edison debt , chief financial officer jim scilacci said tuesday afternoon there is ` ` virtually nothing the company can say ' ' about the private bond sale .
goldman sachs & co . , which sources said is arranging the bond sale , also declined to comment .
edison said earlier this month it intended to use bond sale proceeds to pay down the bank credit line , as well as $ 250 million of notes due july 18 and $ 350 million due nov . 1 .
mission energy holding , which edison created specifically to raise cash , was designed to be shielded from any bankruptcy of socal edison , edison or edison mission energy . some investors have said they are concerned the shield may not prove strong enough .
moody ' s investors service rated mission energy holding ' s notes ` ` ba 2 , ' ' its second highest junk grade . standard & poor ' s , rated them ` ` bb - minus , ' ' one notch lower .
socal edison , which has defaulted on $ 931 million of bonds and commercial paper , ran up more than $ 5 . 4 billion of debt because california ' s utility deregulation blocked it from recouping its soaring wholesale power costs . it agreed in april with gov . gray davis ( news - web sites - news ) , filed for bankruptcy protection on april 6 .
shares of edison closed tuesday on the new york stock exchange ( news - web sites ) at $ 11 . 24 , down 33 cents . they have fallen 28 percent this year .",0

Adegenet offers data import/export functions (from GENETIX, Genepop, 
Fstat and to the packages genetics and hierfstat) as well as several 
data handling tools. It aims at facilitating the access to multivariate 
methods as well as to usual population genetics methods (HWE tests,

Isn't Parrot more comparable to JVM and CLI in this regard, in that  
it's a theoretically language-independent VM, while the examples you  
mention are very specifically tied to one single language? So it  
wouldn't be unexpected that it's the odd out?

It seems to me that the most importance difference between factors and
character vectors is that factors also store the range of the
variable.  You could imagine doing something similar for continuous
variables.  This would have the interesting property that plots of
subsets would have the same range as plots of the original data.  I'd
imagine, just as with factors, this would be useful and frustrating in
equal parts.

In terms of which should be the default, I can imagine two arguments:

 * keep to the original format of the data as closely as possible:
character vectors should be the default

 * maintain as much information about the original data as possible:
factors should be the default.

ees is now fully stepping into the texas wholesale market with this . talking to 70 municipals for aggregated power is ridiculous for ees to be doing . this has to be stopped along with ees providing the "" whitepaper "" products where they are providing wholesale products to san antonio and others . they are making enron look stupid in not communicating what they are doing with the wholesale desk when we are constantly finding out they are talking to customers in our sic codes that we have been working with toward a deal .
i think a meeting needs to be setup between lavorato and delainey or at your level to get this fixed . i have tried working with my peers at ees and they continue to lie to me and keep working customers in our sic code and even worse with iou ' s and municipals .

[R] miktex 2.6 and R,"Hi, 

 

I am new to Latex and in the process of installing miktex to work with R on
windows XP professional. From earlier posts, I see that fptex was the
preferred version, but it is no longer available. Now miktex is preferred.
However, there are known issues with finding the style files in version 2.4.
Fortunately, www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/mikitex.html provides a
series of workarounds. My preference is #4, which appears to be the most
straightforward. However, version 2.4 is no longer available from
www.miktex.org . Moreover, the file structure
changed significantly in version 2.5. For instance, the /localtexmf
directory does not exist after installation of miktex 2.6. I tried adding
""c:/Program Files/R/R-2.5.0/share/texmf to miktex 2.6's root path, but it
returns an error that the path is ""not a TDS-compliant root directory"". I am
not sure how to fix this problem. Any thoughts?

 

Thanks,

 

Steve

I've seen it pop up before and it is confusing in how

[R] chron() question,"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi all,
I'm using chron and it seems to me that there is a strange behaviour
when constructing chronological objects.
An extract of my source data is:

> tdr.hhmm[4860:4870]
 [1] ""22:22:00"" ""22:42:00"" ""23:02:00"" ""23:22:00"" ""23:42:00"" ""00:02:00""

And if I use:
> tdr.chron  tdr.chron[4860:4870]
 [1] (31/12/05 22:22:00) (31/12/05 22:42:00) (31/12/05 23:02:00)

[10] (01/01/05 01:22:00) (01/01/05 01:42:00)

While it seems to me that, through the R recycling rule, it should
consider the year 2006 in the corresponding results. Isn't it so?

Wishes,
Javier

urgent
kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you . although we never met before , i have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality considering the fact that i sourced your profile from a human database on your country . though , i do not know to what extent you are familiar with event and fragile political situation in liberia but it has formed consistent headline in the cnn , bbc news bulletins , my name is dr . leonard rado , from liberia , a country in west africa . formal finance minister in liberia .
since the president ( charles taylor ) was removed from office and the security council on march 16 th 2004 shot listed my name as one of the higher government officials close to the president ( charles taylor ) and impose traveling ban on me with other close associate . you can as well check on the webpage provided below :
during the political crisis as a finance minister i secretly deposited one trunk box tag as diplomatic item of high value with a security and finance company in abroad , ( name withheld for security reasons ) . all the legal documents of the deposit is right here with me .
presently , i have nothing with me because the present government has seized all my account and im now left with this box deposited in a security company . my decision to contact you is therefore , inform by this and due to my present social , political statue and total ignorance of business in the western world . i believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust i repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care .
permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way . on my part this is my assurance and guarantee to you . in as much as you follow my instructions carefully . religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch - free success remains unshakable . i have contacted the security and finance company to confirm the deposit , which worth twenty five million united state dollars ( $ 25 million dollars )
you will be given 20 % of the total sum at the end of the transaction and 5 % for any expense you incure during the process of clearance . if you will be willing to assist me claim the money and invest it in a profitable business venture in your country . i want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is risk free transaction . for security reasons i dont want to talk about this transaction on phone until the tension of this traveling restriction is over . every correspondence should be forwarded to this email : leonardrado 200 @ netscape . net by this time .
this proposal is highly restricted and should be handle as an urgent transaction requiring trust and confidentiality .
thanks while looking forward to hearing from you soonest .

Re: dectalk or double talk advice,"Hi Greg,

  Thanks for filling me in on Slackware. I will first look into the
double talk lt. I kind of figured serial would have to be my obvious
choice, however I jsut wanted to make sure. These systems are older (not
ancient) but bottom linie they more than likely have a few serials on
them.

  As far as the software part goes, are there any other alternatives to
speakup, so at least I can have a taste of a few if I should ever need
another one. It is just kind of up to me to I guess you could say ""fend
for myself"" on this course since the school really doesn't know what is
best for me and never has had a visually impaired person in their
networking course. I wish things woud work out of the box but we know
about that.

Thanks,
Cody

I wanted to do things incrementally. With RT #42898 the patch sequence
dealing with extension guessing is code complete. With the full interface
cut in code I will do up the tests and docs as #429898 gets kicked around.

The relationship between #41908 and the patch may not be entirely clear
because I wanted to get feedback on my plan before I finished all the chang=
es.=20
That is why there is so much speculation in #41908.

I also took care to make sure the existing tree was not disrupted,=20
and that the new behavior could be adopted incrementally.=20
The latter in particular was why what could have been one patch was split=20
into #41908, and #42898. I wanted the preservation of existing behavior tes=
ted=20
by other people before I took the next step.

I will keep your comments in mind with my future submissions to RT. Your re=
ply
indicates that at the very least I could improve my clarity when communicat=
ing
with the project.=20

With these comments in mind if you have a better approach I for the future
please let me know about it.

fred mitro and i just got off the phone with duncan croasdale at enron canada regarding the 11 nls . he indicated that , although nothing has been signed yet , that they are working on several leads . steve thome ( he works for calger ) is also pursuing a lead on these units with montana power .
duncan advised me and fred that the units are on canada ' s books for us $ 38 million , and the asking price is us $ 39 . 5 million .
i am happy to take these units on as you requested . fred mitro and chris booth in my group , who also worked on the successful lm 6000 sales and pending ge 7 ea and sw 501 d 5 a sales , can be made available to work on a sale of these units . in my conversation with duncan , however , he indicated his group wants us to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them . we can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on directly .

venita ' s commercial moment
monthly special
the paradox of
stress
there is a level of genius in every human being
and it is called a ' gift ' . stress however plays a huge role in how
we deliver it to the world . the mystery is that stress is a good
thing when used properly and a bad thing when misused . how can
that be ? consider these get me thru points about
stress . i learned about them the hard way . you don ' t have to make my
mistakes .
stress is a process in life and not just a
thing that happens
stress literally enters your being daily and
it must also be shown the exit door daily
stress should be utilized as a tool for
forward movement in the face of challenge
stress keeps you alert at the beginning ,
weighs on you midway and brings you down in the end if you keep it
to long
stress is an excellent motivator but unlike
motivation , it doesn ' t just disappear
a get me thru nugget of wisdom : wherever
you store your stress is where you can expect to experiencethe
most damage , physically , spiritually or financially . . . in the end ,
someoneelse most likely will have to inform you about the
severity of your damage .
a
get me thru question : do you process your stress daily for
authentic success or do you store it daily for
disaster ?
so you see the parameters of
stress will enter the board room or home , it has no preference . -
it ' s all about people and not position . however , when ignored stress
will ultimately determine how far each one of us goes in life -
guaranteed !
read what i learned about how to
process stress and how misusing it nearly cost me my life in chapter
8 of "" the voice
of my boundaries "" .
the coach ' s play of the
month : "" motivation excites
you about someone else ' s answers . inspiration
ignites your inner
strength through questions thatlead you to successful actions
and self - awareness . ""
the get me thru question for this
month should last you for a lifetime , because stress is a part of
life forever . whether you want to be a millionaire or merely
survive , you too must make a decision about processing stress . your
success in life demands it !

wisdom and then work on your own !

[R] Confidence-Intervals.... help...,"Hi...

I have to use R to find out the 90% confidence-interval for the sensitivity
and specificity of the following diagnostic test:

A particular diagnostic test for multiple sclerosis was conducted on 20 MS
patients and 20 healthy subjects, 6 MS patients were classified as healthy
and 8 healthy subjects were classified as suffering from the MS.

Furthermore, I need to find the number of MS patients required for a
sensitivity of 1%...

Is there a simple R-command which can do that for me?

I am completely new to R...

Help please!

We should probably turn off password prompting if sec=none is specified.

I'd say we'd want to avoid sending along the password in any situation where
it wasn't really needed.

I don't remember it breaking win32. As I remember it, it was committed
the day before 0.4.10 , which wasn't appropriate for a patch like this.

If there are win32 issues I would really like to know about them so
I can resolve them. This patch should not change existing behavior
at all. It adds a bit of infrastructure so that more flexible behavior
can be easily built on top of it later.

It is a ""new feature"" , but from my point of view it is a incremental
towards a bug fix. What sort of format/extension a parrot file will
have is entirely random; this includes critical pieces such as the runtime=
=20
library, making use of basic facilities difficult.

I want to break the hardwiring of the format (.pir|.pbc) when a module=20
is loaded. Once the loader figures out the format loaded instead of=20
hard-coding it all over the parrot tree, then something can be done=20
about normalizing the standard library. "".load_bytecode"" would also be more
like perl ""use"" instead of perl ""do"" .

With patch 5 #41908 the extension is still hardcoded, just inside parrot
instead of all throughout the parrot source tree. Currently the first
open attempted is with the name as-given , so it implements past/current
parrot behavior.

Sane behavior for selecting the  right format when there are multiple forma=
ts=20
for the same source was proposed as PARROT_LOAD_PREFER.

I have authored a couple of lengthy messages hashing out these issues.
I was stalled due to time for a few weeks , but I have dropped enough
items off my open-source TODO to take a crack at this again.

Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.






Erectile dysfunction (ED), 
sometimes referred 

to as impotence, is the inability 
for a sexually active male to obtain 

and sustain an erection for sexual


 purposes. In the past, this has been 
very embarrassing for

 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 



and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment

 options available 


until very recently.







Viagra 
can help you!









The benefits of 
Viagra:
    




Helps men with ED achieve better
 erections 


    




Helps men 
with ED maintain 
an erection during sex 

    


Can work in as little

 as 
14 minutes 




    

Viagra-induced erections 
satisfy


 the partners of men with ED 


    
Has a proven safety 


record
 





    




Works for men 

with ED who 
also have a wide range of health issues 





    




Can be taken 
with other 
medications 



    




As safe for your 

heart as a
 sugar pill

Better is to use stacked format.

value  testno
20     t1
...    t1
40     t1
25     t2
...    t2
20     t2
...

then

anova(lm(value~testno, data=yourdata)) will give you anova table.
However be carefull to keep testno as a factor. You could also consult 
some introductory literature which can be find on CRAN, especially about 
data manipulation and linear models. Maindonald, Verzani or Faraway is a 
good starting choice.

marking chairs,"hello all :
unfortunately , in the last two weeks we have had two of our research "" chairs ""
disappear from their location . we have reported this to security , but in all
likelihood they will be almost impossible to locate .
facilities has told us that they are not responsible for missing chairs and we
will have to order new ones . since they are very expensive , we have
decided to "" mark "" our chairs underneath the seat with a location or name .
sam is going to order some "" silver or white "" markers and we will begin
marking
each chair .
it is a shame we have to do this , but know of no other alternative . we will
let you
know when this will take place .

[R] There might be something wrong with cv.lm(DAAG),"Hi, everyone

When I was using cv.lm(DAAG) , I found there might be something wrong with
it. The problem is that we can't use it to deal with a linear model with
more than one predictor variable. But the usage documentation
hasn't informed us about this.

You can find it by excuting the following code:

xx=matrix(rnorm(20*3),ncol=3)
bb=c(1,2,0)
yy=xx%*%bb+rnorm(20,0,10)

data=data.frame(y=yy,x=xx)
myformula=formula(""y ~ x.1 + x.2 + x.3"")
cv.lm(data,myformula,m=10,plotit=F, printit=TRUE)
myformula=formula(""y ~ x.1 + x.2"")
cv.lm(data,myformula,m=10,plotit=F, printit=TRUE)
myformula=formula(""y ~ x.1 "")
cv.lm(data,myformula,m=10,plotit=F, printit=TRUE)

What happened? they give three equal mss(mean squared error).
Or you can just check the code of function cv.lm(DAAG), then you will find
the residues are all derived from a model with only one predictor, but the
coefficient of that only one predictor can be calculated from a model with
more than one predictors which you've set in the formula term in cv.lm(DAAG),

Maybe you should ask on a webserver list, there is not much perl there.

Maybe the ?s are representing unknown or not provided data or responses from

both ,
thanks for your comments and comparisons , it is good to get context .
based on your comments here would be my proposal
o 63 , 500 basic salary -
ol 5 k kickers for each of the 2 years - these are paid as a lump sum on each
anniversary guaranteed . therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o 78 , 500 -
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
increase the value of options to o 60 k to vest 1 / 3 as before - which leaves a
1 / 3 ( $ 20 , 000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract .
just fyi - anjam is currently on o 68 , 000 but does not have an agreement , so
this would effectively put a 10 . 5 k gap between the two .
let me know your thoughts .

i don ' t know the labor market in london that well but here the market

and i would go an extra mile to retain him long - term for the company .
i would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit .
o 62 , 000 basic is what anjam is receiving currently ( if i remember

Hello,
I am Barrister Frank Kufor, an attorney at law. This mail is written to solicit your assistance to be presented as next of kin to my deceased client Mr Ronald Lake. He made a fixed deposit valued of US 10.5M,(Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) on September 1998 for 36 months
maturity, with an intent of putting up a gold mining company here in Ghana and upon the maturity this bank started contacting him but to no avail
On 31 January, 2004, my client along with his wife died in a plane crash. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site
(http://www.cnn.com/20003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash)
The Governing Board of the bank has contacted me on this matter,based on the fact that his supposed next of kin, happened to die in the said crash and Iam yet to provide any other Next of Kin to lay claim to the fund.
 
Under a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as the next of Kin,so that the proceeds of this account now valued US 15.1 million,will be paid to you, so that the Bank will not confiscate this fund, as the banking law and guidelines here stipulates
that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund
For the sake of transparency on this matter, you are free to make immediate contact with me through my private mail box frank_kufor2@excite.com: or phone line:+23323021738,for further information related to this matter.
 
Thank you very much for your anticipated acceptance while I expect your prompt response.
 
Yours faithfully,
Frank Kufor.

that is not what i am conveying . there may be changes made to the set flow
periodically , but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of
the copano pipeline that may be swinging due to some other customer on their
system . whenever entex asks for a new set point at the new woodlands city
gate , our set point at the new bammel interconnect should align with that
same set point so as there is no swing service on the copano pipeline . our
instructions should only come from entex to change the set point , and should
be confirmed with copano . we are not to provide any instantaneous swing
service on the copano lake creek lateral . any swing provided by hpl for the
woodland ' s load will be made into the copano 12 "" ( formerly ksc ) line as
historically done . there may be additional capacity needed on the lake creek
lateral because of the revised set point , but that is something that entex
has negotiated with copano independent of hpl . still fuzzy ?

vince ,
i am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year . when you stopped by my office , about 18 months ago
you asked if i had any students that might be appropriate for
your group . although i didn ' t at the time , now i do . this student has
excellent technical skills , including an m . s . in statistics
and a ph . d . in economics by the end of the current academic
year . his dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of independent power producers in the us . as a result of research
assistance he has done for me , he knows the california market very well
and is familiar with the other isos . i think he would be an excellent
match for you . the only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available . however , i definitely think he ' s worth a look .
if you ' d like him to send you a cv , please let me know . thanks .

cleburne issues,"daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .

connell : power cost twice davis ' figure
july 6 , 2001
by john howard
the orange county register
sacramento - - the average cost of electricity purchased under $ 43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by gov . gray davis ' administration , state controller kathleen connell said thursday .
connell said her staff ' s analysis put the per - megawatt average at $ 170 , compared with $ 69 to $ 79 estimated by davis .
connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates , although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase .
the controller , who writes the state ' s checks , said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts , which range from a few months to 20 years .
the administration , noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas , said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time .
consumer groups were skeptical of the administration ' s numbers .
"" you could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages , long - range or short - range contracts , peak power or nonpeak , and probably either average could be defended mathematically , "" said nettie hoge of the utility reform network . "" we can ' t tell you whether it ' s $ 69 or $ 170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex . """,0
houston gas & power controls / standards assessment,"as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement
methodology for the london office .
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash
collections are timely )
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date
with exceptions noted )
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward
to seeing you next week .",0

New mailling list practices,"Is anyone annoyed with the new feature of blocking
messages just happen to have a CC: field back to
ourselves?  This done as a verification that an email 
send by is being precisely posted as I typed it, etc.,
so its a copy for my own sake, and no one else, yet
the mailling list wants to quarantine anything with a
CC: field to help prevent spam etc.
Can't it verify that it is the sender own's email and
just let it pass?
I do realize the our messages are posted and most
would feel that is good enough; however if I am
sending this mailling list to a specific folder, but
only want to see what I posted myself, it is far
easier to the the CC: to myself and no one else. as
those messages alone
are part of the normal mail inbox. Works for me.

Any comments on this?

You'll want to tell lynx to show the cursor on the command-line. You
do this through --showcursor, or --show-cursor, I don't remember the
correct syntax. So, you'd do something like:

Re: did I get greedy quantifiers wrong ?,"Untested code.

$str = mississippi;
$str =~ m/m(.*i)/;
print $1; # Should output mississippi

$str = mississippi;
$str =~ m/m(.*i)(.*pi)/;
This requires $2 to have .*pi in it. Since this is a greedy RegEx, $1
will grab mississi (must end by an i) and leave as little as possible
for $2 - ie ppi.

Um. Hope this post helped!

Are you sure you want to guarantee left-to-right starting
position order?  If there are multiple processors available, and
in a lazy context, it may be preferrable to not guarantee any
order.  Then, if one processor that starts at a later position
but which finds a match quickly while another processor starts
earlier but needs to take a lot longer to find its first match,
the lazy processing can start working on the first match found
at the earliest possible time.

hello friend,"from mr . michael siisi ,
greetings to you ,
before i introduce myself , i wish to inform you that this letter is not
a hoax mail and i urge you to treat it serious . this letter must come to
you as a big surprise , but i believe it is only a day that people meet and
become great friends and business partners . my name is mr . michael siisi ,
the present branch manager of a bank here in ghana . i write you this proposal
in good faith , believing that i can trust you with the information i am
about to reveal to you . like i said , i have a transaction that will benefit
both of us , as your assistance is required as a foreigner .
i use to head the accounts department in my bank head office , but last december
i was asked to take position of a manager of our branch in kumasi who passed
on , so that was how i became the present manager and discovered a fortune .
as i resumed duty , i discovered an account with total sum of $ 12 , 500 , 000
million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years . from my investigation ,
i found out that this account belongs to one late mr . morris thompson an
american great industrialist and a resident of alaska , who unfortunately
lost his life in the plane crash of alaska airlines flight 261 which crashed
on january 31 2000 , including his wife and only daughter . you shall read
more news about the crash on visiting this site which i got during my investigation ;
http : / / www . cnn . com / 2000 / us / 02 / 01 / alaska . airlines . list / and http : / / www . nativefederation . org / history / people / mthompson . html
the account is escrow call account , a secret type of account in my bank
and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it ,
the account has no other beneficiary . i have kept a close monitoring of
the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money
as next of kin to the late mr . morris thompson , meaning that no one is aware
of the account . i cannot directly take out this money without the help
of a foreigner and that is why i am contacting you for an assistance to
claim the funds and share it with me . as the manager of my bank branch ,
i have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner
that comes up as the next of kin to the account , with the correct information
concerning the account , which i shall give you .
i am seeking your co - operation to present you as the next of kin to the
account , so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you . there
is practically no risk involved , the transaction will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law .
if you accept to work with me , i want you to state how you wish us to share
the funds in percentage , so that both parties will be satisfied . contact
me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together ,
so we can go over the details . thanking you in advance and may god bless
you . please , treat with utmost confidentiality . i wait your urgent response .
you can as well contact me by fax , + 233 27621073 and my phone number is
+ 233208216645 .
regards ,
mr . michael siisi .

don mentioned that you were interested in the likelihood of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals on the sale to duke .
according to andrews & kurth , it is about 99 % likely that we will ultimately receive the necessary hart - scott - rodino approval from the doj / ftc . it is possible , but not likely , that we will receive follow up questions and even a second request but we should be able to answer any such questions to the regulators ' satisfaction . a & k also cautioned that this 99 % figure was a based on a quick analysis .
with respect to the required approval from the ferc , i was sure to speak to sam behrends of leboeuf , lamb , greene and macrae ( he worked on both of the other peaker sales ) prior to finalizing the psa about the likelihood of getting ferc approval . he indicated that he thought it would be a "" slam dunk "" but i did not ask him to assign a numerical percentage figure to that . i have a second call into him in order to get that number , but have not been able to reach him . i will let you know asap .

dear dr . kaminski
my name is jaesoo lew and i am referred by dr . wayne lee .
currently i ' ve been working at aquila energy in kansas city as an pricing
analyst since july 2000 . since then , i have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options ( forest method ) pricing approach .

since a trinomial forest is required to value storage . also the c + +
programming using excel dll has been developed , too .
i attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at enron .
my home phone number is 913 - 649 - 0578 , dr . kaminski , i will wait your call in

hello,"bank of the north ,
victoria island branch ,
lagos , nigeria .
mailto : e - mail : davideto 6 @ web - mail . com . ar
attn : md / ceo
i am david eto , branch manager with bank of the north , victoria island
branch , lagos , nigeria . i have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled withextreme
confidentiality . on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant and
contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) mr .
james herbert by name made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve
calendar months valued at us $ 25 . 6 m ( twenty five million , six hundred
united states dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent a routine
notification in accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding
address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum
corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james herbert died from an automobile
accident . on further investigation , we found out that he died without
making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i
therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr . james
herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official
documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of
us $ 25 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of my bank to a security company
in europe for safe keeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it and
according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 years the money will
revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to
claim the fund . this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front you
as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal
beneficiary of the sum of $ 25 . 6 million u . s dollars that is presently in
a security company in europe . i contacted you because it is against our
code of ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance
would be needed to claim the money in the security company in europe . we
have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum would be for you if
you agree to take part in this profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2
of my colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay back the
expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction by
both parties after the fund has been claimedand lodged in your
account . in the event that you are genuinely interested in the
transaction , the following information would be needed from you to
expedite action .
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to establish you as the
next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary
of the fund . this would ensure that the security company in europe
releases the consignment / fund to you .
2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where you can be reached
at all time because this transaction entails constant communication . the
transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities has been perfected to
ensure the hitch free success of the transaction . if you are interested ,
soend the requested information mailto : davideto 6 @ web - mail . com . ar
i await your response urgently .

That's where I revolted against this red system. After taking the first step of revolt, I felt that numerous people were waiting for that first step. I only remained alone till the first step and then I was thronged with myself, the common man. We ejected the fear out of people's hearts. The lava of emotions was given way and it melted that system to ashes. The country that had stretched the largest darkness on earth had lost its spell. The people living under the red sun found freedom; a freedom of their own

This is doing a single 'rbind' with the elements of the list as the
parameters so you are effectively creating a single data frame from
it.
>
> #This doesn't do the same thing, which confuses me:
> lapply(mylast,rbind)
This is applying 'rbind' separately to each element of the list (that
is what lapply does - call the function with each element) and will
return a list which is exactly the same.
>

What you are effectively doing is calling data.frame with as many
parameters as you have elements of the list.  See what happens with:

> data.frame(a=list(a=1,b=2), b=list(a=3,b=4))
  a.a a.b b.a b.b

hey ken ,
i just wanted to let you know that the financial settlement group were very
impressed with unify during the first training class that we had on friday .
i did not hear any negative comments , and they even said they liked it better
than sift . some of the key areas in which they see great benefit are :
1 . the automatic calculation of in and out of the money options
2 . the statement group assignment screen and the idea of selecting different
statement groups for different payment terms
3 . the ability to sort and subtotal on financial list screen
4 . the system is more efficient than sift
5 . the ability to view the invoice on screeen and to click directly on the
line to make adjustments
6 . the ability to wire foreign currencies ( really and sap enhancement )
one thing that i did hear is that they wished they could see enron north
america and ena global together on the financial list screen .
i think the development group did a great job , and i enjoyed working with
everyone . i hope that in the next few weeks and months ahead that you will
continue to allow the team to provide our group with quick and efficient
response to areas of concern and enhancements .
thank you to the group for all of your hard work ,

Re: Software speech opinions,"The argument about competition bringing down the price does not wash with 
screen-readers for Windows.
JFW &  W E have both gone up in the past years, and continue to do so.
I am waiting for a screen-reader like NVDA or Thunder to get nearly as 
functional as the above mentioned major screen-readers, and maybe then they 
will come down in price.
But until they have to, they will keep milking us for all it's worth.

Subject: Re: Software speech opinions


I used to have resources for some R&D and did many things. One was
to get a ""special"" keyboard designed for people with limited motor skills,
to find out what was so special about it, and why it was so damn
expesive. Granted it was more expensive than a normal keyboard, had
proximity sensors and audible feedback, and somebody had to write
some custom firmware, but at $450 for a keyboard that was an
astounding sum. If you look beyond stuff like just software, to the whole
assistive tech market in general, you see inflated prices that as I said, I
consider to be obscene.

Software can be free, yes, but that doesn't solve many other needs. Much
work needs to be done and it can't all be free, or the advancement is
limited. As long as assistive tech is considered to be something that is so
radically different that the only answer is ""there are grants for that"" then
choices are limited and some of the much needed R&D doesn't get done.
I personally believe most people are missing something important, that
some of these assistive tech ideas are ones that many people need. Take
speech tech for example, people can't look at a computer screen while
they are driving, and not really efficiently while walking. They do not
need to be disabled in any way to benefit from speech and many other
assistive technologies.

Work on all of these things are more globally desireable than one would
think if you break them down into parts. Take a keyboard for example,
there should be multiple modalities available as the input to anything and
the output from everything in the long term. I'm all for open source but
then to expect everything to be free means, at least to some degree, you
get what you pay for. People will pay for good tech, if it's fair priced.
At least part of what is happening, the part I don't like, is that for some
things, they are intentionally so expensive that nobody can afford them
without some subsidy, grant, insurance, or some other bueroctratic
process. More comptetition would actually drive prices down. More
people making products would be a good thing. If all assistive tech
was done for free then it would only ever be hobby activity, it will
never put food on the table of people who produce it.

psychological torture by the security agents in the country .

various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different
security firms abroad , some companies willingly give up their secrets
and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many out right

Once I heard on Anatrim in the media advertisement and I was really effected by the information.

 I had attempted using it, and my wife said to me that I'm a different person now, 3 months later. 

26 pounds have gone away and I keep still losing them!

pg & e sues to recover uncollected costs,"pg & e sues to recover $ 3 billion
exploring yet another legal avenue , pacific gas and electric co . wednesday
filed in san francisco ' s federal district court asking for a judicial ruling
that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $ 3 billion in
uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since may
when price spikes in califonia ' s market left the state ' s major investor - owned
utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996
levels .
the utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved ,
therefore , it filed in federal court . earlier in the fall , pg & e appealed to
the california supreme court , asking to overturn a california public
utilities commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover
its wholesale costs , which it passes on to customers without adding a profit
charge .
"" we ' re just keeping our legal options open , "" said a san francsco - based
utility spokesperson , noting that the utility also is attempting to protect
its financial status , which was challenged tuesday when fitch placed it and
another california utility on a "" rating negative watch . ""
state and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing
investigations that california ' s current wholesale electricity market is
broken and noncompetitive in its current state , said roger peters , senior
vice president and general counsel for pacific gas and electric . "" however ,
there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for
recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers
must have , either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair
prices , or through retail rates . these costs are continuing to grow . ""
noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale
charges , pg & e ' s utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the
charges from its almost four million customers , and it reiterated five steps
it has taken to "" increase supply , moderate customer demand , repair the broken
wholesale market and provide stable , reasonable rates . """,0

GPLv2 is a very frequently-suggested DFSG-free licences, has been the
subject of repeated analysis, http://lists.debian.org/search.html
is in the FAQ, http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq
the web page http://www.uk.debian.org/legal/licenses/
and probably other places.

I don't think it's particularly interesting that periodically posters pop
up on debian-legal thinking they've spotted a new flaw in GPLv2.  I expect
that licensing@fsf gets a number of those too - debian's difference is its
openness.  I think almost all of them end up agreeing once it's explained
clearly.

Hope that explains,

Re: [ot] Windows programming,"Actually, I'm very definitely *not* a fan of visual basic.
I use powerbasic instead (http://www.powerbasic.com)
It comes with a rather large subset of the windows api calls already  
converted to powerbasic includes, and I simply study those when I need  
to know what api is needed to do something.
Also, in addition to having one large win32api.inc file, they also  
have broken it into smaller includes such as tcp/ip, comm, playback  
services, graphic manipulation, sapi speech, and more.
It's really an excellent development environment, 100% accessible, and  
programs are considerably smaller than any visual basic program you'll  
ever see.  Not to mention, everything you need for the execution of  
the program is compiled into the exe file, so there's no need to hope  
the folks have the proper dlls on their systems.
And, they're still supporting, upgrading, and creating new versions of  
their tools.
They even still sell powerbasic for dos.
Now, how's that for support.
In fact, pb for dos was just upgraded to version 4.0 (from 3.5) only a  
year or two back.

RE: Changes in the Israeli mirrors for Debian,"Hi all,
 
The mirror has been running for the past month with a more redundant RAID configuration (on expense of storage area, of course :( ).
 
1. The IPv6 addresses will be either removed or utilized by the end of this week.
2. The non-US directories were synced from ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/, using the official anonftpsync script. Should I use another upstream server to sync from?

OK. I get :

The following entries were submitted: Submission-Type: new

Site: mirror.isoc.org.il

Archive-http: /pub/debian/
CDImage-http: /pub/debian-cd/

A proper project/trace directory was not found on the HTTP server.

The error message returned was: 404 Not Found

If you don't understand this error message, please contact us.

Entry not submitted!

Although http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/debian/project/trace/ is there.
And I tried to access it from gluck.d.o and it went fine. Could you check?

Dear valued member.
I wanted to advise you on which Web pharmacy to choose to save your time and money without having to risk your health.
So far, the experts of our Association has been dissatisfied with the quality of almost all the Web pharmacies that we have been investigating. Actually, the only pharmacy we can recommend you is USDrugs  the only e-shop were constantly monitoring thus reducing the danger of drug falsification to the minimum.
Please, be more discerning when choosing your Web pharmacy.

Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.





Erectile dysfunction (ED), 
sometimes referred 

to as impotence, is the inability 
for a sexually active male to obtain 

and sustain an erection for sexual
 purposes. In the past, this has been 

very embarrassing for
 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 



and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment

 options available 
until very recently.


Viagra 
can help you!










The benefits of 
Viagra:






    

Helps men with ED 


achieve better
 erections 





    Helps men 

with ED maintain 
an erection during sex 





    




Can work in as little


 as 
14 minutes 


    
Viagra-induced erections 
satisfy
 the partners of men with ED 

    


Has a proven safety record
 
    

Works for men 


with ED who 
also have a wide range of health issues

[R] [R-pkgs] ggplot2 0.5.2,"ggplot2
===================================

ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics,
which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and
none of the bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details
that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as
providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce
complex multi-layered graphics.

Find out more at http://had.co.nz/ggplot2

Changes in version 0.5.2 ------------------------------

* add argument to position dodge so it's now possible to accurately
dodge things with different widths to their physical widths
* added median summary
* new examples:
	* logistic regression example in stat_smooth
* bugs fixed:
	* evaluation of arguments to layer is no longer delayed
	* can use categorical xseq with stat_smooth
	* x and y axes named incorrectly (thanks to Dieter Menne for spotting this)
	* can now pass position objects to qplot
	* y jitter calculated correctly, and jittered data rescales axis now
	* removed silly legend from quantile plot
	* extra arguments not being passed on to geoms/stats
	* fixed bug in stat_summary when summarising a factor
	* fixed bugs in stat_summary, geom_ribbon, and coord_trans examples

broad update on el paso system,"el paso south system flows 700 mmcf / d
less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on el paso natural gas ' system
in southeastern new mexico , the pipeline last week had more than 700 mmcf / d
of its 1 . 1 bcf / d capacity restored to its south mainline that services
markets between texas and california .
at mid - day friday , el paso said it began running about 260 mmcf / d through
line 1100 after it received the go - ahead from the federal office of pipeline
safety ( ops ) , according to spokeswoman kim wallace . el paso was able to
re - start partial service on the 26 - inch line after it built a 16 - inch
temporary connector line between line 1110 and line 1100 , which was approved
by ops .
the temporary connector was installed just east of the pecos river explosion
site , about 30 miles from carlsbad , nm . wallace said line 1100 would carry
the gas from eunice , nm , just northeast of the pecos river compressor
station , to the connector with line 1110 , which then would transport it
westward across the pecos river bridge where it would meet up with line 1100
further downstream . meanwhile , wallace said el paso submitted to ops last
week the test results and a preliminary return - to - service plan for line 1100 .
three days prior , the ops had given el paso permission to restore service to
line 1110 from the keystone station through the pecos river compressor
station at a reduced level . the pipeline re - opened the line at about 400
mmcf / d , and gradually increased it to 480 mmcf / d by friday . this is "" still
within the limits it [ ops ] set "" for line 1110 , wallace said .
the ops restricted el paso ' s line 1110 to 80 % of the operating pressure of
line 1103 at the time it ruptured , according to department of transportation
spokeswoman debbie hinz . she said this put the line at a pressure of about
538 pounds per square inch .
the ops - ordered shutdown of line 1110 lasted 10 days , during which the agency
ordered el paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic , ultrasound and x - ray tests
to determine its safety , and to submit a plan for restoring service to the
line .
as for the future of ruptured line 1103 , wallace said repairs on it would not
begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed , which will
"" probably be nine to 12 months . ""
the restoration of service couldn ' t come soon enough for el paso customers
who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal
investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up el
paso ' s south main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and
critically injured one . california customers have been taking gas out of
storage to meet their needs during the service interruption . the department
of energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion
and shutdown on the gas market .

Re: A common Debian style for Debian Installer and the desktop,"Hi,

In my view, it is a mistake to discuss the installer artwork
independent of the general look and feel of the desktop. The important
thing is to create a unified desktop, which normally incorporates all
of the artworks. The installer and the splash artworks should function
as a branding images, therefore they should be simple and visually
revealing in order to burn the brand in the mind of the user with the
least possible effort on his part. Yet, they have to fit perfectly
into the general look and feel of the desktop.

caiso notice - underscheduling penalty and pg & e bankruptcy claims,"bar date
important notice
underscheduling penalty and
pg & e bankruptcy proof of claims
as you are aware , the claims bar date in the pg & e bankruptcy is september
5 th . consistent with our practice of providing information held by the iso
to market participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in
part by pg & e , the iso is today sending to each scheduling coordinator an
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the
underscheduling penalty is not modified by ferc . ferc adopted the
underscheduling penalty in a december 15 , 2000 order . because there are
several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty ,
to date the iso has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing
pursuant to the underscheduling penalty . it is our expectation that
scheduling coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they
schedule , information that is relevant to them .
as we have advised in prior market notices , although the iso settles
transactions on behalf of market participants , the iso is neither authorized
nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of market
participants in any bankruptcy proceeding , i . e . assert claims of "" iso
debtors "" against "" iso creditors "" ( iso tariff section 11 . 20 . 1 ) . further ,
while the iso may be asked by an "" iso debtor "" to assert such claims in the
px or pg & e bankruptcy cases , the iso is not obliged to do so and will
decline any such request . the iso expressly disavows any liability for any
market participant ' s claims , whether or not the market participant files any
such proofs of claim in the px or pg & e bankruptcy proceedings .
further , as we have advised in prior market notices , all statements ,
including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty ,
are subject to change . a number of transactions are currently known to be
the subject of disputes and market reruns . there are also proceedings
pending at ferc , federal courts , and state courts , the outcomes of which may
affect amounts owed by pg & e to each market participant or by the market
participant to pg & e . in addition , we anticipate that further disputes and
proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect
the calculation of such amounts . the iso will continue to work diligently
to resolve these matters as quickly as possible . nonetheless , it is clear
that significant issues may remain unresolved and / or unidentified by the
claims bar date .
market participants should consult their own legal counsel as to their
respective rights and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the px
and pg & e .

subject : entex transistion
the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account :
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group ,
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations
process and the contracts .
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all
your hard work on the account this year ! ) .
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex
"" account "" team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account .
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 .
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop
by . thanks in advance for everyone ' s cooperation . . . . . . . . . . .
julie - please add thu to the confirmations distributions list",0
louise,email me the bonus file sometime on monday . i may have some time on my hands .,0
hpl close,"great job to all ! ! we made it from contract execution to financial close in 5 months . this success is a testament to the effort put forth by all of you and your colleagues in finalizing the transaction , including :
1 . setting an industry record for responding to a 2 nd request from the dept . of justice and securing their approval .
2 . expediting the analysis and repair of a 60 mile segment of the a / s pipeline .
3 . transitioning hpl ' s hardware and software infrastructure from enron to aep
4 . unwinding four complex monetizations related to the assets with a value of over $ 150 mm
5 . separating hpl ' s business process , work flow , from enron ( after 75 years of integrated operation )
6 . segregating property between leased and purchased facilities
7 . collecting and sorting over 14 , 000 boxes of books and records
8 . moving over 250 people from 4 different enron entities into a new location while keeping the pipeline operating .
7 . accounting for the transfer of prm assets , cwip , leased assets , purchased assets , imbalances , payables and receivables .
the transaction freed up approximately $ 725 mm of capital that enron can put to work earning higher rates of return in its newer businesses , but the work on hpl is not over yet . there are a number of follow up activities that we need to complete in order to maximize the value of the hpl transaction . jim coffey will be managing these activities on an ongoing basis , including :
1 . collecting outstanding accounts receivable and working with aep to resolve imbalances .
2 . closing out accounting entries for property , work orders , external accounts payable , and internal charges .
3 . eliminating and mitigating any impact from retained assets and liabilities .
4 . fully transitioning hpl systems , facilities , and books / records to aep .
again , thank you for your effort - and if i have inadvertently missed anyone please pass along my appreciation to them as well . we will be hosting a lunch for the enron / hpl employees who worked on the transaction on the 15 th of june at 12 : 00 in the imperial ballroom at the hyatt regency hotel . please attend if your schedule permits .

subject : internship
dr . kaminski :
?
i just wanted to touch base and see if i needed to snail mail a copy of my
resume or get in touch with anyone else over at enron . ?
?
the finance department at lsu will be sending out financial award letters to
new ph . d . students before long , and my interning at enron would free up some
additional departmental funds . ? in addition , if i will be here in baton
rouge during the fall , i will need to pay my tuition next month . ? i am able
to pursue an internship in large part because of the department ' s
cooperation and assurance that when i return i will still have a research and
or teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of ph . d . ? i have been
told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at lsu , so i am trying to
rock the boat as little as possible .
?
i realize until i receive an offer from enron my internship ( i say
internship rather than sabbatical because lsu will not continue to pay me my
stipend while i am away ) is not assured until an offer has been extended by
enron . ? i understand that there are procedures ? and protocols that must be
followed before this occurs , and i would be willing to do whatever is
necessary to move to the next step in that process .
?
i will be in houston on july 8 & 9 for my wife ' s grandmother ' s 80 th
birthday . ? if it would be convenient , i could be in town ? on the preceding
friday , or following monday for a visit and / or interview . ? if not , given the
relatively close proximity between baton rouge and houston , i would be happy
to come at another time .
?
thanks again ,

Re: [R] loop in function,"Actually I am not sure what you want exactly, but is it

11 10  0.03  0.09  0.10  0.11  0.33

each column ""goal"" corresponds to row of df1. Alternatively, the sapply()
function can be rewritten with apply():

apply(df2,1,
      function(a,b) (a[""x""]+a[""y""])/(a[""z""]*b),
      b=df1$b)

Hope this answered your question...

Public Docs,"Hi,

I can't seem to find online copies (at an ""official"" URL) for many of the
documents that are in svn and generated by ""make html"".  Do they exist?

For example, is there a copy of
parrot/trunk/docs/html/compilers/tge/TGE.pir.html anywhere?  There is
nothing at http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/compilers/tge/TGE.pir.html

The reason I ask is that I am writing a web page about how to start using
Parrot and want to reference these documents.

Thanks,
Andrew",0

Re: [R] Lookups in R,"the problem I have is that userid's are not just sequential from
1:n_users.  if they were, of course I'd have made a big matrix that was
n_users x n_fields and that would be that.  but, I think what I cando is
just use the hash to store the index into the result matrix, nothing
more. then the rest of it will be easy.

but please tell me more about eliminating loops.  In many cases in R I
have used lapply and derivatives to avoid loops, but in this case they
seem to give me extra overhead simply by the generation of their result
lists:

> system.time(lapply(1:10^4, mean))
   user  system elapsed 
   1.31    0.00    1.31 
> system.time(for(i in 1:10^4) mean(i))
   user  system elapsed 
   0.33    0.00    0.32 


thanks,
mike

New Revision: 22732

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=22732

Log:

- Testing of libsmbclient against Vista revealed what is likely a bug in
  Vista.  Vista provides a plethora of kludges to simulate older versions of
  Windows.  The kludges are in the form of shortcuts (or more likely symbolic
  links, but I don't know enough about Vista to determine that definitively)
  and in most cases, attempts to access them get back an ""access denied""
  error.  On one particular folder, however, "" /Users/All Users"", it
  returns an unknown (to ethereal and the Samba3 code) NT status code:
  0x8000002d.  Although this code does not have a high byte of 0xc0 indicating
  that it is an error, it appears to be an alternate form of ""access denied"".

  Without this patch, libsmbclient times out on an attempt to enumerate that
  folder rather than returning an error to the caller.  This patch corrects
  that problem.

[Ip-health] Thais offer help,"The Nation, Wed, June 20, 2007

Thais offer help

The Thai Network of People living with HIV/Aids (TNP+)
and its allies vowed yesterday to stand in solidarity
with a Paris-based Aids activist group in its legal
fight with giant drug firm Abbott Laboratories.


TNP+ said it was ready to be a witness for Act
Up-Paris, which was taken to court by Abbott for its
April 26 cyber attack on the company website as part
of a worldwide protest against the drug firm.


Act Up-Paris was among the Aids activist groups in
more than 12 countries that joined the International
Day of Action on April 26 to protest against Abbott
for its withdrawal of applications to register new
life-saving drugs in Thailand.


The withdrawn drugs included a new heat stable
formulation of Kaletra, an anti-retroviral drug used
for Aids.

................

(full Statement of TNP+)

ACT- UP, a long time AIDS activist group based in
Paris, is being sued by US pharmaceutical giant,
Abbott, for action taken whilst participating in the
International Day of Action against Abbott on April
26th 2007.

Thousands of people around the world participated in
an ACT UP lead netstrike that saw Abbotts website
bombarded with hits and forced a slowing of its
server. Abbott is now taking legal action in what they
ironically deem a denial of service. If successful,
ACT UP could be fined more than $50,000 in addition to
legal expenses. This is being seen by ACT UP as a
clear attempt by Abbott to silence them and deny them
the right of free speech.

French law stipulates that it is forbidden to limit
access to a website, unless the defendant had a
legitimate motive. Holding companies accountable for
unethical conduct and highlighting the denial of
essential medicines in the name of greed and profit
can surely be interpreted as a legitimate and
honourable motive. The Thai network of people living
with HIV/AIDS (TNP+) and their Thai alliance stand in
solidarity with ACT UP and  welcome the opportunity to
debate Abbotts shameful policies in a court of law.

On April 26th, France was one of more than 12
countries that joined in the International Day of
Action in protest of Abbotts withdraw from
registration in Thailand of life saving drugs
including a new heat stable formulation of Kaletra, an
anti retroviral drug used in the treatment of
HIV/AIDS. Activists from Thailand and around the world
called for a global boycott of Abbott products in
response to their unprecedented and unethical conduct.
Thai activists and PLHA also called on the Thai trade
competition commission to instigate legal action
against Abbott in breach of competition law 25(3) that
prohibits a dominant firm from suspending, reducing
or restricting services, production, purchase,
distribution, deliveries, or importation without
justifiable reasons.

Abbotts withdrawal was in retaliation to the Thai
governments announcement that it would issue 2
compulsory licenses for ARV, including the Abbott
produced Kaletra and one for a heart medication. These
compulsory licenses issued by the Ministry of Public
Health was an attempt to expand treatment access to
vital yet expensive drugs and was in total accordance
with WTO rules and regulations.

TNP+ and an alliance of civil society groups and
HIV/AIDS activists fully supports ACT UP Paris
actions and believes that the right to protest is
fundamental. Demonstrated dissent on the International
day of action was necessary to highlight Abbotts
complete lack of moral code and their precedence for
profit over lives and to send a message to Abbott that
these kinds of intimidation tactics will not be
tolerated.

TNP+ in united with ACT UP in demanding that this
petty lawsuit be dropped and that Abbott reverse their
decision to withdraw life saving medicines from
registration in Thailand.

Yeah, and we're not lying about adhering to our ideals simply by
distributing the obligatory license data. If we weren't doing that,
we'd have no product of our ideals because we couldn't distribute it.

(Oh my god we betrayed our idealism by adhering to the copyright law!!!1!)

fulfil my last wish please,"dear friend ,
firstly , i wish you the very best wishes of good health and success . i also enjoin you not to wonder as this letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met . i have to say that i have no intentions of causing you any worries as i decided to contact you through this medium . as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry or pity for me because i believe everyone will die someday . my name is mr larry moore , a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal cancer that was discovered lately due to my laxity in caring for my health . it has defiled all forms of medicine and right now , i have only about few months to live according to medical experts .
i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business . i wasn ' t too generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my businesses as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god gives me a second chance to live in this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it .
however , now that i know my time is near , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations and people , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . i have willed and given most of my properties and assets to some orphanages as well as some schools in the u . a . e . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself any more . the last of my money , which i planned to use in openning a shopping complex in london is a huge cash deposited with a financial security firm abroad , i want to donate it to any worthy , charity organisation , hence my contacting you with blind trust having been led by my intuition of goodwill .
my request
as a result of my present health situation , i am looking for a trustworthy individual / firm to help me collect this deposited funds with the financial firm abroad and dispatch it to charity organizations and let them know that i , mr larry moore , is making this generous donation as a dying man ' s last wish . i am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed where i wait for my time to come . i pray that god uses you to support and assist me with good heart .
commission / remuneration
as regards your commission / remuneration , i have decided to offer you 25 % of the total sum and also set aside 5 % for all your expenses ( i . e for any expenses you may incure during the process of this project ) . i strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this , will derive a huge success hereafter and it will mark a lasting bond for you and profound joy for me . if you are willing to assist me i will be expecting your response . please write me only through my secure email
address : mrlarrymoore @ mail 2 uae . com
i await your anticipated co - operation .
sincerely ,
mr larry moore .
nb : i will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the task is accomplished because i do not want anything that will jeopadize my last wish , as i do not want my family people to know about this because i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money , which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . i will be communicating with you by email as i do not want anybody ( my medical staff ) to know what i am up to as they are always around me .

Hi! Which kernel do you use now? Did 2.6.18 work?

I have seen many (ubuntu/debian) people complain that their computer
got very slow after moving to dapper/etch.

The solution somebody offered was to use the 486 and this seems to work
for 2.6.18 at least.


Hopefully 2.6.20-686 works though

Re: [R] Suggestions for statistical computing course,"Thanks to everybody who responded to my query. I got many useful
suggestions about books and editors, plus notes and other material
online. 

Summarizing, the books suggested were

- Monahan, Numerical Methods of Statistics
- Lange, Numerical analysis for statisticians

In terms of Editors, TINN-R was mentioned several times, in addition
to R's build-in code editor.

I will report to the list on my experience in this course and whatever
books/tools I will end up using, since there seems to be some
interest.

Have a good weekend!
Giovanni

Re: [R] odfTable,"Hi,

There are a couple of steps, and it requires use of the newest version of
odfWeave.

First, you need to set up the table styles in R _before_ you run odfWeave.

Here's an example:

	# Now to specify the styles themselves
	# The default list has 10 styles in it right now.
	existingStyles >=
	### Conditional formatting based on the value of the table cell

fw : getting a deal done,"- - - - - original message - - - - -
from : belden , tim
sent : thursday , december 20 , 2001 3 : 27 pm
to : lavorato , john ; whalley , greg
subject : getting a deal done
i recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now . however , i feel that i currently don ' t possess the information that i would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in newco . i will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what i have heard about structures so far . excuse me if i am off on any ( or all ) of my facts . i am currently receiving mostly second - hand information from gas and power traders in houston .
here is the citibank deal as i understand it :
requirement to retain between 5 and 15 employees to do the deal .
fund ( at some unknown level ) a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of the 800 newco people .
800 employees
$ 30 million of 1 - day 95 % var
total 2002 costs of approximately $ 300 million .
bonus pool equals 20 % of ebit
bonus paid out 75 % in cash and 25 % in restricted stock with a 3 - year cliff vest .
here are my concerns
the cost structure appears to be well above what a $ 30 million var trading operation can support .
my recollection from west power rovar is roughly 90 % in 1998 , 120 % in 1999 , and close to 200 % in 2000 and 2001 . i ' m not sure how to handicap expected future rovar , but without additional information from the two of you i have a hard time expecting more than 100 % in a lower - priced commodity market . given that assumption , the $ 30 million one - day var becomes $ 480 million annualized var gives you gross margin of $ 480 million . i don ' t know what the capital and credit charges will be , for arguments sake let ' s call it $ 30 million . bonus pool equals $ 480 - $ 30 - $ 300 = $ 150 * 20 % = $ 30 million of which $ 22 . 5 is cash and $ 7 . 5 equity . i can ' t sign up for that math . please help me understand how / why my math is wrong .
i need to understand our cost structure in great detail . we need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level . if i look at west power ( everyone in portland ) assume that we have 80 people with an average of $ 200 , 000 for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of $ 16 million . add on another $ 4 million for rent , parking , travel and entertainment . . . and call it $ 20 million of direct expenses here . i figure that we can make $ 100 million in 2002 with lower var and starting up later in the year . how much of the $ 280 million remaining costs should i expect to be allocated to the west power desk . with an ebit of $ 80 million times 20 % i can sell . if we have another $ 50 million of allocated costs then i can sell this .
i recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk ebit . however , i think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk ebit and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that .
proposed retention structure for three people in portland
a dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years . price tag tbd .
create certainty around the bonus / retention payments .
indemnify against payback of deferred comp .
clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the desk .
15 % of gross margin for 2002 . 20 % of ebit going forward .
other gripes
labor has not been invited to the negotiating table .
labor doesn ' t get to see the pro forma .
we are supposed to get paid based on ebit yet i have no control over the expense side or the allocation side .
labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating .
labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn ' t appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure .
i want to make this thing work . i am not trying to be greedy . i am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that i have been given .

update - reporting to work next week,"many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week , especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today . we want to encourage you to come to work . we continue to consider every option available to us as a company ; and unfortunately , restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options . your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process .
i still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy . but you should be aware that , in general , the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $ 4 , 650 per employee . i want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition , we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices . additionally , enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing . for enron , where our value is directly tied to our employees , making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority .
we are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue . of course , until we finalize those business decisions , we cannot make that determination . i know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you . i can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so .
while terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment , we hope to do what we can to assist them . we will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search . we have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in enron alumni . we will share more information on these efforts soon .
i appreciate your continued patience and cooperation .

length is client-determined here, so definitely tainted (in
the perl sense). But still I don't see how this can wrap.
length and num_ucs2 are both unsigned, and right before the
malloc(num_ucs2+1) num_ucs2 was calculated as
num_ucs2=3Dlength/2. Maybe I'm not paranoid enough, but for
which values can this wrap?

The current Perl 5 behavior is

cowens@amans:~$ perl -le 'my @a = (""-"" x 5, ""foo"", ""-"" x 5); print ""@a""'
----- foo -----
cowens@amans:~$ perl -le 'my @a = ((""-"") x 5, ""foo"", (""-"") x 5); print ""@a""'

I am against anything other than that for x or xx without a really

I assume it is a bug in Pugs implementation of cat, but
pugs> ~cat('a' xx 5)
""a a a a a""

I also am having a hard time figuring out why I would want an infinite
string.  My first thought was something like

my $ten_zeros = substr(cat(0 xx *), 0, 10);

but that is more clearly written as

my $ten_zeros = 0 x 10;",0

Aov, lmer, and anova.mlm with the Spherical option all fit essentially 
the same model, but lmer has less fine control over small-sample 
properties and the effect of departures from the assumptions (partly 
because it needs to deal with unbalanced data).

Lme with an estimated covariance matrix is similar to anova.mlm without 
assuming sphericity. They are often less powerful than the 
sphericity-with-correction alternative, because of the larger number of 
estimated parameters. The balance should shift in ""large N, small p"" cases.

rita and lisa ,
why don ' t ya ' ll get together and determine a range of days / times that would
work for your groups to have a training session . ( over lunch or early
afternoon ) if you are interested , i would like to discuss how we operate the
hpl system and the processes we go through during the trading day . to help
with the discussion , i have maps which highlight the main points and areas
where we transact . ( there will be a few for you to keep at the desks . )
i did this with the logistics group . i think it went pretty well . if you
want to do this , we need to allow 1 . 5 to 2 hours to talk about everything .
let me know .

i spoke with brian nichols about the august preliminary invoice . there
appears to be a problem for august 28 & 29 - the volumes are much too low .
either there were deliveries off of centana that we are missing , or there is
a problem with the hpl data . i am having brain fade and cannot remember the
name of the person in the measurement department to contact , so maybe you
could look into this and have it corrected .

email : abachafamily 557 @ katamail . com
attn : sir / madam ,
it is my pleasure to contact you in a situation like this , i know that
the content of this letter might be a surprise to you , but even though
we hardly know each other , but i believe that you can help me .
i am mrs . mariam abacha , the widow of the late gen . sanni abacha former
nigerian military head of
state who died mysteriously as a result of cardiac arrest .
since my husbands death , my family has been under restriction of
movement and that not withstanding , we are being molested , policed and
our bank account both here and abroad are being frozen by the nigerian
government . all this is because the present nigerian president was put
in prison by my husband when he was found guilty of plotting a coup to
over - throw my husband . all my husband friends refuse to come to our
aid because of fear of the president and for governmental positions
which he had offered them .
following the recent discovery of my husbands bank account by the
nigerian government with swiss

Re: [R] sas.get problem : the saga continues.,"#Continuing my sas.get saga.  Hmisc has been been

getting the same problem. I seem to have aa SAS

The GOF test will always depend on the parameter values, since it has to 
estimate them (if you don't provide them yourself). Anyway, the gamma 
family is so versatile that you can fit *some* gamma distribution to 
almost any nonnegative continuous data.

Maybe it is easier and sufficient to use the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test, 
that is implemented as ks.test() in R. However, I am not able to check 
your reference, so my comment may not be what you want at all.

Imagine       being  part       of  a    stable     organization   with     a    sterling    reputation     -  a       place       where       the     Sydney    Car  Centre     is   an       integral    part       of  all that    we  do.  With  our  car   centre   personality,  you'll not   just succeed -   you'll  thrive.      And,    with     our      strong      commitment     to promoting       from      within,       you'll     definitely  enjoy     your       rise     to the     top. Today   the      Sydney   Car   Centre   is   looking       for   an       industrious   regional   assistant to       fasten    the       process of  the     delivery       of customer    payments to   the  suppliers.  The   position     offered  is   a       part-time       job,       and     will     only      require     from   you      to       be   available      for    1-2  hours  a  day. As      a regional      assistant,    you will     be     supposed  to operate    with   the     payments   from  those      customers,   based     in      your    country.       You      will be  expected    to  accept      2-3     transactions    to      your     bank     account every week,    make certain    calculations      about    every      transaction   (you  will be   precisely   instructed      about   it), & transfer    the      funds   to the suppliers     by      means of    western Union/Money Gram  less      your      fee      &     the       charges     of the       Western   Union/Money Gram.   You       will  be      continuously       communicating     with     the   manager      from       the head   office,     who will   instruct you   & give advice   regarding   every    new payment. The     ideal candidate     will  be       industrious,  goal-oriented       person,   with     the      availability    of      a       personal/business       bank      account     suitable     to be   used       for the   company  needs.

hoping for portland :,"hey there ogre ! ! : ) just teasing ! ! !
well unfortunately i ' m still up in the air over the portland thing . it
doesn ' t make it any easier when i know that not only does one of my best
friends reside there but now i have a new lil ' buddy ! i am so excited about
seeing portland and meeting you . you are just as brendan described ! i just
can ' t imagine that that big deep voice comes out of such a baby face !
bill you know just how to push all the right buttons to get me to really
want to go ! the second paragraph of your last e - mail made me so jealous !
that was probably the most romantic setting and scene and to think that it
was written by a man ! ! ! i am sooo impressed ! you might not even know what
i ' m talking about ! typical male ! hahaha . just in case . . . "" the roof
scene "" . what ' s even better is that you weren ' t trying to be suave !
i think that your little "" city portrayal "" has just entered into the
. . . "" things about oregon i know i ' m going to love "" . now we ' ll see if sarah
has an open roof top ! you did miss a couple of important features though .
if i may . . . uh hmmm . . . the scene lacks a certain social depth . it requires
a beautiful girl / guy , a light blanket , soft music and if i drank wine ( which
i don ' t ) a bottle of boones farm strawberry hill 1993 . ok the last part is
a joke i just don ' t know any other brands of wine . : ) a nice bottled water
with lemon for me i suppose . reverse osmosis and filtration only . : )
i ' m sending a couple of pic ' s of me from my tahoe snowboarding trip last
december . they are actually the only ones i have in jpg format . i think
the only differences are that i have a little curlier hair now and it ' s a
bit longer . but basically i ' m the same .
tell ya what . . . if i do get to go i will get a hotel room not because i
don ' t trust you etc . but because it ' s just the "" right "" thing to do . then
i ' ll give you a call or stalk your condo building looking for the resident
on the 8 th floor ? ? answering to bill williams iii and that hangs out on
rooftops . oh and the clencher ? ? ? it ' s located across the street from the
paramount hotel . scary how i listen and pay attention to detail isn ' t it ?
you know i ' m joking . . . . right ? if i were like that i ' d jump at the chance
to stay with you .
i really hope that i get to make it tomorrow . if not i know i ' ll get to see
you last of august . i ' m counting on it ! oh and you will stay with me at
the town house . i insist . it ' s a little different when a girl stays with a
guy then when a guy stays with a girl . it just "" looks "" better the other way
around ! but like i said you will stay with me in august . i ' m 10 minutes to
the beach and maybe by then i ' ll have my california tan ! mmmm ! can ' t beat
that !
ok well i ' m going to bed . i ' ll call you to let you know what the plans are .
my plane leaves at 9 : 19 am so i may not get the chance to e - mail you before
hand but we ' ll see .
good night !

"[R] Problem installing gnomeGUI in Ubuntu: ""HAVE_ORBIT"" was never
	defined","I am trying to install the gnomeGUI package
I have tried from within R (R was started with: sudo R) with:
install.package()
and from console with:
sudo R CMD INSTALL /download/gnomeGUI_2.3.0-3.tar.gz
In both cases I get the exact same errors:

checking for gnome-config... no
checking for gnomeConf.sh file in /usr/local/lib... not found
configure: error: conditional ""HAVE_ORBIT"" was never defined.
Usually this means the macro was only invoked conditionally.
ERROR: configuration failed for package 'gnomeGUI'

Found the following in earlier message in R-help list:

 From B R Tura
""So I think gnomeGUI not instalable in R now...""

Response from Prof Ripley:
""This is almost entirely misinformation. gnomeGUI is a package on CRAN 
(and has been for a couple of years), and can be installed just like any
other package. Like several others, it requires R to have been 
configured with --enable-R-shlib.""

Any help would be much appreciated.

mkproto.sh promotes lazing programming, leads to bad interfaces
and to monolithic code.

We should all suffer the pain of change *.h and *.c when
change an interface.  I strongly agree with James on this one
since it was already on my list of things to work on.

It seems to make sense.

And indeed, I would be satisfied with the MIDI file as source for the
song, as long as the MIDI file corresponds to the complete song (and not
to one instrument only, for instance...).
I do not happen to know if this is the case here, and that's why I said
""I'm not sure"".  A clarification should be sought, IMHO.

I'm not really convinced: we must ask the person(s) who made the
recording.
If there are non-lossy-compressed recordings of the separate tracks,
they could be preferred for making modifications.

Your parenthetical sentence just expresses the concerns that I had in
mind when I said ""I'm not sure"".  A clarification is needed.

Really important, IMO.

I don't know, but I'm afraid we need one, as long as the soundfonts are
copyrightable works by themselves...

Re: [R] Fwd: Using odesolve to produce non-negative solutions,"On the 'lsoda' help page, I did not see any option to force some 
or all parameters to be nonnegative. 

      Have you considered replacing the parameters that must be 
nonnegative with their logarithms?  This effective moves the 0 lower 
limit to (-Inf) and seems to have worked well for me in the past.  
Often, it can even make the log likelihood or sum of squares surface 
more elliptical, which means that the standard normal approximation for 
the sampling distribution of parameter estimates will likely be more 
accurate. 

      Hope this helps.

p.s.  Your example seems not to be self contained.  If I could have 
easily copied it from your email and run it myself, I might have been 
able to offer more useful suggestions.

Re: [R] random effects in lmer,"Rina

p-values are not generated as a part of the lmer object returned. If you read the ranef help it will show you two things. First, how you can get a ""caterpillar plot"" and second how you can get the posterior variances of the random effects. Then, you can do your test to see if they are different than zero.

Yea... let's say I constructed a matrix with rownames/colnames be those

find the field.. I'm wondering if there's a smarter way using row/col..

Re: [R] Weighted least squares,"Dear Hadley,

I think that the problem is that the term ""weights"" has different meanings,
which, although they are related, are not quite the same. 

The weights used by lm() are (inverse-)""variance weights,"" reflecting the
variances of the errors, with observations that have low-variance errors
therefore being accorded greater weight in the resulting WLS regression.
What you have are sometimes called ""case weights,"" and I'm unaware of a
general way of handling them in R, although you could regenerate the
unaggregated data. As you discovered, you get the same coefficients with
case weights as with variance weights, but different standard errors.
Finally, there are ""sampling weights,"" which are inversely proportional to
the probability of selection; these are accommodated by the survey package. 

To complicate matters, this terminology isn't entirely standard.

I hope this helps,
 John

recent projects,"hi vince ,
i have been working on and / or planning to work on the following projects :
1 . finished a gas daily swing option model for commodity structuring
group ( sanjeev khanna ) . the model uses american monte carlo
simulation and dynamic programming techniques .
2 . continue working on psim model . this includes reading power generation
and operation books as well as thinking about ways to model power plant and
its operation . the standard approach ( i . e . turn the plant on if power
price > total
generation cost , else turn the plant off ) is not particularly good if the
regional
demand is very high and the plant still has some un - utilized generation
capacity .
that is , the generation criteria is quite different depending on we model
power
plant from regional point view or from plant point of view . plan to have
meetings
with tom and lance .
3 . started working on stochastic process parameter estimation . i will
concentrate
on four processes : gbm , mean reverting , jump diffusion , and jump diffusion
with
mean reverting . i have looked at tanya ' s earlier work and decided to
discretize
the processes slightly differently . it is hoped that this will give a more
stable
estimation .

risk focus group,"i ' ve created a project in livelink called "" risk issues focus group "" , in an
attempt to centralise the communication between our groups .
to access it enter this in your browser address line
edms . livelink . enron . com / ena
when the page loads , there will a drop down box in the top - right corner with
the words "" go to . . . . ""
select that and then select personal workspace .
at this point its a good idea to add the browser page to your favorites as
you can then get back to your personal workspace directly
you will see a row of tabs just under the header bar and one in particular
called "" projects "" . if you select it a page will be displayed showing all the
projects that you are currently a member of , own , or a guest of .
in that list of projects you should see "" risk issues focus group ""
select that and you will be presented with the project page . . . . . there is a
search bar and a scrolling news header plus the following
an issues discussion forum
a news channel
an it and business task list
folders for documentation and process maps
this was my first stab at a layout . . . but it ' s free - format , so we can do what
we like with it
. . . . i ' ve started adding documentation already and there are some news items
and a few it tasks identified .
i would welcome comments !

First off, those three could probably be simplified slightly as:
as.numeric(exp(-diff(result$estimate)))
as.numeric(exp(-result$conf.int))

The simplest solution I think is to specify that resp$treatment  
should have the levels ordered in the way you like them using this  
first:

[R] like SPSS,"Hi,

I've written code to extact a pumf file in R, subset it, and weight it

non-smokers (2) after having weighted my file? or even the process that 
SPSS is going through to aggregate the data?

Thanks,

a pdftotext question?,"Hi all,
I did check the help file for this, yet I must be missing something.
I have a password protected pdf file to open.
I also have the password I should be able to use.
There are two password related options in pdftotext,
-upw for user password,
and -opw for owner password.
I suspect it is the latter that I need, but I am getting the same error 
when I try either.
there are several errors actually including that the name token is too 
long.
This leads me to think that the password should be enclose in something so 
the program does not think it is part of the file name.
Still the syntax looks like something that is normally removed.
Ideas at all?

Thanks,
Karen

CTRL-C tells the shell to send a SIGINT to the currently executing
process.  Therefore, all you need to do is have your program define a
SIGINT handler:

$SIG{INT} = sub {
  print ""Nyah-Nyah, you're CTRL-C doesn't scare me!!\n"";
};

[R] sizing and saving graphics in R,"Dear R wizards,

I am seeking advice on graphics in R.  Specifically, how to manipulate  
the size and save a plot I have produced using the LDheatmap library.   
I confess I am relatively new to graphics in R, but I would greatly  
appreciate any suggestions you may have.

LDheatmap produces a coloured triangular matrix of pairwise  
associations between 600 genetic markers in my dataset.  Initially the  
graphical output was confined to the computer screen, such that each  
pairwise marker association was displayed as approximately 1 pixel  
(too small for me to interpret).

I have successfully managed to play with the LDheatmap function to  
enlarge the size of viewport by changing the following code in   
LDheatmap

#From

heatmapVP Save As->bmp), it only saves the section I can see on the  
screen.  Any suggestions on how to save the whole plot or manipulate  
the plot so I get higher resolution would be much appreciated.

Thanks for your help in advance,

Felicity.

re : real options conference in cambridge,"lenos
i ' d like to give a talk entitled "" diagrammatic representation of real options
in enron "" , in which i will give a brief run - down of a diagrammatic technique
i have developed for representing real option deals . my notation allows
originators , managers and quants to communicate unambiguously , while still
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality . i have defined
a "" diagrammatic grammar "" which guarantees that the pricing of the deal
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram .
i propose to introduce the symbols and grammar , then go on to present some
suitable examples of diagrams . if appropriate i ' ll talk about the links with
dynamic programming . ( i will need some guidance as to how much technical
detail i can go into based on the audience . )
all the best ,

That's the simplest way to satisfy the GPL unambiguously in that type

hi john ,
following our chat yesterday ( see memo below ) . as i get into the role i will work on reducing our costs across the company . i think that if we can make the costs more apparant to the employee and their supervisors , we can make the employees self regulate what they have . i . e . buy less , save directly at the bottom line , increase enron ' s profit ratio and get the stock price back up .

jenny / martin ,
john lavorato had a bit of a go yesterday about all the hardware we ' ve ordered for the new building i . e . 8000 new screens . he complained about assistants having multiple flat screens etc and he generally complained about bibi ' s policy of giving the best to everyone . he used the example of many trading houses that he has seen on tv in the recent news coverage as still having crt ' s for their traders .
can you let me know if we currently have standard configurations both in the new and old building of what we give people at certain levels .
i want us to start working on making employees understand the cost and getting them to think about saving money . we can start to do this by publishing openly the costs of each component of typical setups . we could also ask people to turn in equipment they may have that they dont need and we can redeploy ( we did this effectively in europe ) .
you will probably tell me we already do this , and thats good , just show me .
this will become a general theme .
thanks

re : letter to nesbitt,"vince ,
your note looks good to me , short and to the point .
i assume this will prompt further detailed discussions with dale . i would
want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model
and database for north america . unless a familiarity with the short term
model is a prerequisite , i doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on
it .
depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term
model , it might be helpful to have access in both omaha and houston ?
we would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need
for testing the model . steve hotte , cio for ets , would co - ordinate the
in - house installation for us . at some point , it will be helpful to get steve
in contact with the appropriate marketpoint it rep .
assuming that you get acceptable clarification of these issues , dale should
probably send to us a modified licensing agreement for review .
let me know what i should do next .

re : project triple lutz,"all fixed priced deals ( esp . calpine ) have their risk assigned to the price
book . dutch quigley confirmed that these deals were more than likely hedged
( although it is difficult to hedge 20 year deals since we are one of the few
playing out that far ) . if we are under the assumption that we will be able
to transfer all hedges along with the deal ( s ) , then these deals are not
underwater . however , there will be some costs associated with transferring
the hedges . when i get a better idea of these costs i will relay them to

to date , my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the

involved with the entex contract valuation . dave baumbach has been the real
key to providing the data , and has all of the information . steve jackson is
talking with ed mcmichael of structuring on monday to get some additional
eyes and resources looking at this also . i feel we have done a thorough job ,
but we do need everyone thinking of "" what if ' s . "" our risk books are complex ,
with many hand - offs internally . obviously our goal is to ensure that all of
the stones have been turned , and there are no surprises at the end of the
day . i think structuring will really be helpful in this arena . after our
meeting yesterday , i believe everyone is much more comfortable in our
approach . there were a couple of things that dave was going to follow - up on
( fixed - price deals , especially calpine ) .

available , and will have the triple lutz data with me . if any issues come up

hunter on the gas trading side i say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best organization structure . it will get everyone working . we need that . i would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they ' re focused on business .

re : sale of napoleonville land,"louise ,
on monday , prior to my leaving for buffalo , i spoke with dave gorte and was informed that since the sale of the napoleonville land was greater than $ 2 . 5 mm , it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a dash .
since the negotiations were quite contentious between reliant , texas brine and enron - we ( eva , lisa and myself ) had worked with mr . gorte to create multiple versions of the dash . it was not until wednesday afternoon that reliant was the chosen "" victor . "" in addition , since i felt you were apprised of the deal and mr . gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process , lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule .
unfortunately , this meant wednesday afternoon around 4 pm , but we had been informed by tammi schoppe that you were available until 5 pm . even though the banks were closed , i had wanted to sign the executables on wednesday so reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend . it was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction .
i will be flying back to houston today and will be landing around 5 pm . both eva rainer and lisa druzbik are in today and i am leaving instructions to ( hopefully ) close the deal today . julie gomez will be signing on my behalf - - for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to eva . my cell is 713 - 302 - 4187 .

louise ,
tomorrow , i am flying to buffalo , ny for thanksgiving with my father . as such , for the potential sale of the napoleonville land , julie gomez will sign on my behalf for lrci inc . after both appropriate commercial , accounting and legal parameters have been met . the status is as follows :
texas brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 mm and has the opportunity to counter . texas brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $ 2 . 35 mm .
reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "" act of sale "" document . as such , gerald nemec ( my legal ) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups ( i . e . litigation and environmental ) .
i am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving . however , this bidding "" war "" has the potential for ena to extract an even higher auction price . the approximate book value of the land is $ 1 . 4 mm .
i can be reached via blackberry or cell ( 713 - 302 - 4187 ) . eva rainer , manager , is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions .

teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project . should
circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip , please return the

in the future , we can discuss arrangements at that time .

hello christie ,
thank you for organizing the wharton trip to enron . unfortunately , the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as i ' ll have to miss over
4 hours of classes , which i cannot afford to do . i tried changing the time
with continental and there latest flight leaves at 6 pm - which does not work
for me ( smack in the middle of my 3 hour class )
thus the dilemma that i find myself in is the following :
a . try a different flight as i can make any flight after 7 : 30 pm ( however , i
have no control over reservations / budget etc )
b . as it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year , use this ticket to come
some other time
sorry for this but i just saw the bookings today .
any suggestions ?
thanks ,

subject : re : japanese crude cocktail & prompt brent
chris ,
thanks for the response . the comment about hedgeing jcc with brent is right
on if the exercise is to hedge our own lng positions that we have tieds to
jcc . note that the high jcc correlation to prompt brent is not something that
is obvious to non - enron lng - tied - to - jcc buyers . if you are an lng - tied - to - jcc
buyer , and you wish to hedge your purchases , wouldn ' t you want to be able to
transact ona a jcc contract ? my objective is to have a jcc contract on eol ,
whereby we , enron , take the jcc / brent risk ( which is why we asked vince
kaminski ' s group to study the relationship and give us a hedge ratio to use ) .
i ' m attaching a model used to calculate jcc for dabhol power co . ' s adgas and
oman lng contracts . basically what happens is that all the "" raw oil "" volumes
imported into japan and added up and the total price is divide by the total
volume , and there is a yen / us $ foreighn exchange component as well . that is
jcc . it was designed by the japanese so that they could tie their lng imports
to their average price of crude imports whereby the lng would be cheaper on
an mmbtu basis .

it is not a very liquid market . everyone is going the same way .
i understand there is good correlation between brent and jcc . i know little

chris ,
some of egm ' s lng group ' s lng is priced using a jcc - based formula . there ' s
also a lot of other lng contracts that use jcc as the pricing basis . in june
we obtained sign - off from vince kaminski ' s group to hedge jcc using prompt
brent ( see the messages with the relevant hedge ratio below ) . can we set up a
contract on eol , using the prompt brent - jcc hedge ratio , to hedge jcc ?
fyi , on a btu conversion basis :
therefore , to hedge 1000 mt of lng , a customer would need to transact on a
hedge for 9000 bbl of jcc . can we list a jcc swap in 9000 bbl / month
increments ?

re : confidential,"dale ,
thanks for your message .
i don ' t know the labor market in london that well but here the market
for quants is very hot . steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and i would go an extra mile to retain him long - term for the company .
i would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit .
o 62 , 000 basic is what anjam is receiving currently ( if i remember
correctly ) . steve has a much higher value
to enron than anjam .

re:,"Have you seen how these sub-one-cent companies take off on

It may be prohibitive, but it seems to be the request.

Future is impossible, I agree.

Charley Here,"Hans just told me about what they have been doing lately.

Your not going to believe it at first because neither did I.

They get to stay home everyday, use the phone returning phone calls and actually
making a really good living from it.

They don't have to sell anything at all, just simply returning calls on the companies behalf.

Last week thier earnings were in excess of 5k!!

So you know I figured what the heck lets give it a try so I called the 24hr info line and got all the details.

So I was thinking about you and figured you may want to find out more yourself so here is the number.

8OO.572.4121


I really hope you give them a call as I would hate to see you miss out. This is perfect for stay at home moms,
retirees or anyone else who has always wanted to be there own boss.


Anyways have a great day, call them up and let me know how it went.

Again the number is 8OO.572.4121


Talk Soon








Since we had communicated in the past I thought of you as likely a person who would be interested.
If I am mistaken then let me know with a reply via email so I don't bother you anymore.

I'm strongly opposed to either change.  Mainly because
we are simply shifting the responsibility of who is
supposed to know what they are doing.  The original
intent of forcing winbindd to use the winbindd_ads
methods if possible was that the the solely rpc
methods would not always retrieve the data in a consistent
manner.

So rather than expecting the AD admin to know what they
are doing, we are shifting the burden on the samba admin
which is not really any better.

Perhaps if someone gave an example of how the AD install
was not working it would help to win me over.

subject : factor loadings
i hope that the following clears up some of the confusion regarding the
above - captioned process .
factor loadings are an input to value - at - risk ( var ) . generally , you can
consider them the determinants of relationships between curves , and points on
curves based on trader inputs . these pertain to all curves not just north
american natural gas . there is a specific program which calculates these
relationships which requires a considerable amount of processing time ( 3
hours per run ) as well as another few man - days to evaluate the results .
there is no "" ideal "" or recommended period in which these must be updated .
more frequent is "" better "" . given the amount of time it takes to refresh , it
was "" agreed "" a long time ago amongst rac , research , it and operations that
it would be done every 2 weeks . no commercial input was received . the roles
were to be simple as they are with most roles in and around var and other
risk management controls :
research specifies the math
it codes the program
operations runs the program
rac evaluates the results
the process has been run every two weeks on the second thursday of every
month since february ( as it had been prior ) and rac has rejected the results
because the results did not reflect the underlying math because of the
complexity of the math and the continuing addition of new products and
curves . this created the need to recode the application from scratch . rac
continued to agitate to get this done , particularly knowing that the pressure
on the efficacy of var would be questioned as we went into the volatile
period of 2000 ( e - mails from rudi zipter available upon request ) . the new
code was implemented last thursday and the results were accepted resulting in
an approximate 10 % difference in var .
rac had requested that the code be re - written on 6 / 10 / 99 @ 7 : 44 am with a
target completion date of 8 / 2 / 99 . this was discussed and accepted by
phillipe bibi on 6 / 17 / 99 in a meeting in his conference room with rick buy ,
dan bruce , jonathon le , ted murphy , bill bradford , debbie brackett and rudi
zipter along with the rest of our task list .
we have resolved that the process will continue as stated and will
communicate to you the results .
there are dozens of other processes that are important to the calculation and
interpretation of var that need to be implemented , enhanced , improved or
rewritten altogether . for example , the jump - diffusion factors for north
american power have not been refreshed in 2000 . the prioirty is dependent on
the level of precision required .
i will provide a comprehensive list of those processes in due course .

The only advice I would give here is to separate the
marshalling as strictly as possible from functionality so
that in case we decide on a different pipe format from now
you don't have to change much.

michelle ,
i was wondering where we stand now on the pogo interconnect south of wt - 1 on
the west texas lateral . per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded
like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up . what
will be the design capacity for the interconnect ? i think you told me , but i
can ' t find it in my notes . my understanding is that there will be a
chromatograph , sulfur monitor , water monitor , flow control and a way to shut
in if pressure reaches our maop . also , who will own and operate the
station ? let me know if i ' m off base on any of this or what i ' ve missed and
also don ' t hesitate to call if you need anything . please let us know as
things progress .

TTBOMK, I've complained that it's taking a long time to progress, not
that nobody was doing anything.

I offered support to at least two of the drafters, but drafters seem to go
AWOL after the first public draft (or one even seems to have gone before).
There has been a succession of attempts to create a policy, in different
forums and requested by different people - I now know of five unfinished
attempts in the last three years and I suspect there were probably more
before that.  Did the drafters know of those that went before?  Maybe they
didn't get the briefing or support they needed from the project leaders?

So I suggest the problem is not in defining or DD support, but in
management or communication.  Now I'm trying to connect the various
lists that should be communicating about this (spi-board, spi-trademark,
debian-legal, debian-project among them) to help this complete, but I'm
very cautious about treading on toes, because I know I hold a minority
view on this and I know how frustrating it is for an interested party
to be mistakenly excluded from this sort of process.

I'm well aware that my views on trademarks (available to all, harmable
by none) are not the consensus view, so I probably shouldn't draft this
policy.  Another reason is my bloody terrible record on GR drafting in
general, although I think that's partly an artefact of something else.

Why no elected leader yet has led this thing that sorely needs leadership
is beyond me.  Some leaders who should have been managing this drafting
seemed keener on money than this irreplaceable asset.

Hope that explains,

[ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ]
A copy of the report is attached. The suggestion of reducing patent life for
me-too's/new formulations (pg 8) is noteworthy. However, that is clouded by
the idea of increasing patent terms to 25 years (or even 50 years for
groundbreaking vaccines provided they are sold at universally affordable
prices) to incentivise more innovation for creating novel (which is not
defined) products to serve unmet medical needs.

Drugs industry economics 'not sustainable' - report

 *Marianne Barriaux
Wednesday June 13, 2007
The Guardian *

 The pharmaceutical industry business model is ""economically unsustainable"",
according to a report by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. The study
suggested drug companies' reliance on heavy marketing of a few drugs in the
hope of huge sales meant they were ""operationally incapable"" of acting
quickly enough to produce innovative treatments demanded by global markets.

According to Steve Arlington, the main author, drug companies spend twice as
much on research and development than 10 years ago, yet produce half as many
drugs: 40 to 45% of medicines in phase 3 clinical trials, the last stage,
now failed.

Shares in pharmaceutical companies have not performed well, sales and
marketing costs have increased, as have legal and regulatory constraints and
the reputation of the industry has been tarnished by high-profile cases such
as Vioxx, Merck's painkiller that has provoked thousands of lawsuits.

Healthcare providers and payers are keen to reduce the amount they pay for
treatment. People are living longer but not necessarily healthier lives,
leading to predictions of a global pharmaceuticals market that will more
than double in value to £660bn by 2020.

Dr Arlington said the pharmaceutical industry would have to change to
capitalise on these opportunities, partly by shifting its investment focus
towards research and less on sales and marketing. ""It must focus mainly on
the development of medicines that prevent or cure. But in all cases, the
drugs will have to demonstrate tangible benefits and tackle unmet medical
needs.""

The pharmaceutical industry needed to come together with other relevant
players - governments, patients and investors - to discuss the best way
forward.

One of his suggestions was that patent protection for drugs, set at about 20
years, could be extended to a much longer period to incentivise the
companies to produce more innovative drugs and sell them at a lower cost.

The report suggested expanding the pool in which companies fish for basic
research - to Asia, for example, where research is less expensive - or
increasing cooperation with academia. It also mentioned the need to
transform the way companies performed R&D, by focusing on building a much
better understanding of the disease itself to accelerate research.

There is some evidence that pharmaceutical companies are starting to change
their research models. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, today opens a £50m
clinical imaging centre at Hammersmith Hospital in conjunction with Imperial
College and the Medical Research Council. GSK said the facility would allow
it to partner academia to use the latest advancements in imaging to better
understand diseases and how to treat them, speeding up the development of
new drugs.

The report concluded the industry would have to move fast to make these
changes, or face another round of mergers and acquisitions with leading
companies falling into private equity hands.

*Patent medicines*

The top pharmaceutical companies are expected to lose 14%-41% of their
existing revenues by 2012 as *patents* expire. *Pfizer* will suffer the
expiry of patents for *Viagra *and *Lipitor*, the world's best-selling
medicine, leading to the loss of about 41% of its revenues. *AstraZeneca* is
expected to shed about 38% of its sales and *GSK* sees the patents of its
two best-selling drugs - *Advair *and *Avandia *- expire by 2012, with a
predicted loss of 23% of revenues.

WAITING FOR YOUR URGENT RESPONSE,"Greetings from Dubai,

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe 
it is only a day that people meet and become great friends 
and business partners.  I am Mr. Arif Shaikh, currently Chief 
Credit & Risk Officer with a reputable bank here in U. A. E.  
I write you this proposal in good faith,believing that I can 
trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition 
for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant
/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR MOHAMMAD
AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months,valued 
at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand 
Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer 
before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon 
maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank 
manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the 
letter was returned undelivered. 

After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was 
again returned and finally I discovered from his contract 
employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Mohammad Al 
Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam 
Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to 
his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information 
to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered 
that Mr. Al Nasser's family wife and two sons died during 
the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare 
any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, 
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not 
leave any WILL.  This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been 
floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my 
bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 
2003.  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I 
have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am 
the only one that have the information.

With the recent change of government in my country and with 
their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating 
terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By end of this year, the 
government will pass a new financial control law which will 
give the government authority to interrogate account owners 
of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds,
making sure it is not for terrorism support.  If I do not 
move this money out of the country immediately, by end of 
the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, 
because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain 
the source of the money.  

I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help 
of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an 
assistance.  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser,coupled 
with my present position and status in the bank as Chief 
Credit & Risk Officer , I have the power to influence the 
release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the 
next of kin to the account, with the correct information 
concerning the account, which I shall give you. All documents 
to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and 
there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be 
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you 
from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything 
goes.

If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you 
wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both 
parties will be satisfied.  If you are interested, contact 
me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over 
the details.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.  I shall send 
you copy of the

deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit 
was made for your perusal. 
  
I wait your urgent response.  

 
Regards,

 
Mr. Arif Shaikh",1

enron europe organisational changes,"once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this
year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on
co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts
in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very
closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric
will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing
arcos .
we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination
responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti
will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric
shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and
portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman .
the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread
position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility
for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more
likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas
markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and
the continental gas team .
ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power
transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will
pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent ,
and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to
eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission
responsibilities .
finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team
than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages
our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis .
we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help
make these changes as smooth as possible .

Folks,

I've cobbled together the svn commits for SAMBA_3_0_25 that
address a few very visible bugs in 3.0.25:

* The object picker error for ""security = domain""
* Supplementary group membership bug with ""force group""
* Premature password expiration on Samba DCs

You can grab the patch file from
  http://samba.org/~jerry/patches/patch-3.0.25.diff

Please test and if we get a majority of thumbs up, we'll
follow up with 3.0.25a in the next day or so.





cheers, jerry

Re: [R] running Rcmdr,"Thanks for your answer, but i think i dont do correctly my question.
I need the command line to run Rmdr, like that:
R < Rcmdr or  R < loadRcmdr.R where loadRcmdr has ""library(""Rcmdr"").
or something like that.
I tried the last example, but when Rcmdr is executed, later it is closed.
About RProfile.site, i dont know what i have to change. If you think its 
useful to me, please explain me.
Thanks.

our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation . it does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated . you have been working on this almost a year , it never
strikes you that we need a documentation ?

Re: [R] R2 always increases as variables are added?,"Junjie,
    First, a disclaimer:  I am not a statistician, and have only taken
one statistics class, but I just took it this Spring, so the concepts
of linear regression are relatively fresh in my head and hopefully I
will not be too inaccurate.
    According to my statistics textbook, when selecting variables for
a model, the intercept term is always present.  The ""variables"" under
consideration do not include the constant ""1"" that multiplies the
intercept term.  I don't think it makes sense to compare models with
and without an intercept term.  (Also, I don't know what the point of
using a model without an intercept term would be, but that is probably
just my ignorance.)
    Similarly, the formula you were using for R**2 seems to only be
useful in the context of a standard linear regression (i.e., one that
includes an intercept term).  As your example shows, it is easy to
construct a ""fit"" (e.g. y = 10,000,000*x) so that SSR > SST if one is
not deriving the fit from the regular linear regression process.

[R] sliding window approach,"Content-Disposition: inline

Dear all,

I would like to know if there is any R package that uses a sliding window a=
pproach to assess statistical significance out of my data. My data is compo=
sed of DNA sequences (of variable length) that are mapped to a genome with =
a determined score of alignment.=20
=20
So, I want to see if I can find more tags in a given region of the genome a=
s opposed to finding them by chance. In this sliding window I would like to=
 be able to calculate a p-value for the amount of tags found, compared to t=
he number of tags I would expect to find by chance.
=20
P.S. If you know, please recommend other tools that I could use for graphic=
al assessment of p-values from this sliding window approach.

Set the default socket_wrapper interface inside the test env setup, so

Hi all

 

Just wanted to drop you a quick line to point out a great collaborative film
project CCau took part in over the weekend - the Open Channel Video Slam
(http://www.openchannel.org.au/artslaw/index.html). Apologies for cross
posts.

 

Basically the idea was to produce one 10 minute film, made entirely out of
CC and original content, by locking 22 filmmakers in a bar for 33 hours a
whole lot of equipment, wireless internet access, and coffee, alcohol and
pizza. The event was organised by Andrew Garton of the Open Channel Screen
Resource Centre (http://www.openchannel.org.au ) a government funded film production and
training centre, and was hosted by Horse Bazaar
(http://www.horsebazaar.com.au/) a great digital-arts bar in the heart of
Melbourne that hosts the Digital Fringe Festival each year. Elliott Bledsoe
and I from CCau were both there to help with training and addressing tricky
issues (eg licence compatibility, searching etc). 

 

What we ended up with was a 10 minute film that incorporates 110 CC-licensed
works - photos, video, sound, music. This final product was screened in
Horse Bazaar and on the big screen in Melbourne's cultural hub, Federation
Square, at 7pm Monday 14 May. It's also available for download under a
BY-NC-SA licence at http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/. 

 

It was a truly amazing experience, and a great learning curve for both us
and the participants. Elliott and Andrew both documented the experience on
their blogs (http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/ and
http://elliottsawitfirst.blogspot.com/).  We're also hoping to write up some
of the lessons learned in an article, and maybe even an academic paper.

Unfortunately, you still cannot use Hershey fonts with plotmath (just
lacking implementation).

Also, the perpendicular symbol is not implemented in plotmath (yet).

In this case though, there may be a possible workaround.  Try the
following ...

> plot(1, ann=FALSE)
> title(ylab=expression(epsilon[""\136""]), family=""symbol"")

The plain text character ""\136"" gets drawn using the symbol font and the
perpendicular symbol is character 94 (Octal 136) in the Adobe Symbol
Encoding and in the Windows symbol font encoding so this works for PDF,
on Windows, and on X11 (though I had to switch to a single-byte encoding
to get my system to pick up the symbol font).  The drawback with this
solution is that anything that is NOT a special mathematical symbol in
the expression will come out in Greek letters.

[R] Creating contingency table from mixed data,"Hi,

I am new in R. Please help me in the following case.

I have data in hand:
http://www.nabble.com/file/8225/Data.txt Data.txt 

There are some categorical (binary and nominal) and continuous variables.

How can i get a generic RXC contingency table from this table? My main
objective is to fine count in each cell and mean of continuous variables in
each cell.

Please reply.

Thanks in advance.

Just make sure to avoid ATI graphics cards if you plan on
running open source only and don't really need all fancy
acceleration. You can find almost all Thinkpad models with an
Intel graphics card for a reasonable surcharge, if you just
dig deep enough into the Lenovo website.

london risk reporting,"well ,
today ( or rather yesterday ) it happened . we have been pushing our limits
hard and the makets here have been very volatile . we had a large increase in

Re: [ot] Windows programming,"I'm sure your solution would be more complete however note that vmware can 
emulate a serial port that can be connected to a named pipe. This might 
illiminate a layer of complexity or add one.
Sorry that isn't much help but it's something to think on.

CNN Tonight:  Valerie Bertinellis Fight to Lose Weight

Valerie Bertinelli in a primetime exclusive!
Her plan to lose weight as the whole country looks on.
Did her stressful split from rocker hubby Eddie Van
Halen have anything to do with her weight gain?

But first, an inside look at the meeting yesterday between
Don Imus and the Rutgers womens basketball team.
Theyve accepted his apology, but he'd
already been fired - the debate heats up.
Plus, the pastor who mediated that meeting tells us how it all
went down and how this could become a catalyst for more change.

Tonight only on Larry King Live!

New Revision: 23411

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23411

Log:

We were missing displayName and that was preventing us
from successfully deleting an entry when ""account"" is
the STRUCTURAL objectclass used for users and machines.
""account"" is used each time the user entry is in /etc/passwd
and we have only the samba attributes in ldap, as well
as for rfc2307(bis) standard based directories.

Not really at the moment (very jet-lagged :-) but I know

thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days . i have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months , enron remains the best place i have ever worked . this is due , in no small part , to the great people i share this place with .
i also owe you an overdue e - mail on the mexico matter . as i had indicated , i have decided not to take the offer . i have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous : monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family , but it is altogther different and more difficult for a single man . therefore , despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team , i have decided not accept the offer .
many thanks for keeping me in mind , being patient , and moving things along . i will be in touch in the next couple of days . enjoy your holiday .
best regards ,

ahead . however , critical technical , regulatory , and financing constraints must
be overcome before these energy flows reach the potential indicated by current
market fundamentals .
key issues affecting us - mexico cross - border energy flows include
* asymmetrical regulatory and market structures
* power grid synchronization issues
* high investment needs in a changing regulatory environment
* uncertainty of long - term regional supply - demand imbalances

Sure - isn't this the ""SET_FILE_INFO"" variant for an already open  
handle?  In this case, I'm opening an existing file directly for the  
first time.

Thanks - it turns out that when  you use a creation_disposition of  
FILE_OPEN, then info == FILE_WAS_OPENED - this results in a failure  
to check the FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE bit in the 3.0.24 codebase - as I  
mentioned, we can't upgrade, so I think I'll have to hack this  
together and run smbtorture.

Unfortunately, due to our FS related divergence from the codebase, a  
number of smbtorture tests fail - which would you recommend as most  
pertinent in this case?

Re: Speakup with Ubuntu,"Hello Terrence,
I suspect that using Festival with Speakup and Orca could cause the problem.
How did you manage to get Festival work with Speech-dispatcher and 
Speakup? I tried this and didn't succeed.
Orca and Speakup both need the Festival server running, and that is 
maybe what causes the trouble.
Do you use Ubuntu 7.04? If so, you can use Orca with Espeak.
Switch to it in the orca speech settings by choosing Espeak as speech 
synthesizer.

"[cc-community] Q. about license metadata in <span> element and
	XHTML validation","Hi all

I apologize if the issue has already been tackled in this list. It was
raised by Norbert Bollow in
https://your.trash.net/pipermail/siug-discuss/2007-June/003793.html .

I.e. the code you get for a ""general"" license (without registering the
work) puts the ""dc"" metadata about the type of license in a element, which the W3C code validator http://validator.w3.org/ doesn't
accept. Whereas if you register a work under a license, the metadata
(which also include author, right holder, title, description ecc) are
in a element, which the W3C code validator accepts.

Sure, one goal  is that search engines should be able to read the
metadata, and they obviously can with the solution too. But why
the difference? Why doesn't the code for a ""general"" license put the
metadata in a element too, if this what the W3C standards
apparently require?

It's not just a matter of being able to put a
http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10 button on a site - but valid
code makes general access possible.

Best

I'm not sure what you mean by ""write down the lines"". If you mean  
that you want to know what the row names are, then an answer is:

This patch grew out of Hackathon Toronto and was posted to RT, but not 
initially cc-ed to the list.  Please review this patch.  Thank you very 
much.

The attached patch to inter/progs.pm is my attempt to improve
Configure's behaviour.

It writes an embedded minimal C program to disk. (If there's already a
file called ""minimal.c"" it complains and dies.) It then attempts to
call the specified compiler. If the result isn't an a.out, it dies
promptly and gracefully. (It can be fooled, if something other than a
C compiler writes an a.out; that's how I tested it, but that's really
a pathological case.)

The comments should explain what's going on.

thanks , i will try and collect the information today . vasant and i were
thinking that it would make sense to let people try the application under the
test environment for a few weeks . then we can incorporate any additional
suggestions and move to production around the first week in april .
our meeting room does have a screen and network connection , and we can
profide an lcd projector as well . how about thursday of next week ?

sorry to have to do this to you but i need some additional information in

convenience . also , the group has only been set up in the test environment .
do you want to add the users to the test environment or are you ready to
migrate to production ?
as far as the demo is concerned , i  , ll be happy to accommodate your group .
how many people do you expect at the demo and does the room have a display

can you add access to the following users for the livelink research projects
database ? also , would you be available to give a short demonstration and
tutorial on how to use livelink for our group ? we hold a lunch meeting
each thursday from 11 : 30 - 1 : 00 in 30 cl at which there is usually a short
presentation on a topic of interest . i think it would be very useful for the
group to have an overview of how to use the tool before everyone jumps into
it . the presentation can be quite informal . let me know if you would be
available in the next couple of weeks .

louise ,
1 ) i just received a call from pat o ' donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from ubs corporate marketing folks , instructing us not to use the url : www . ubswenergy . com . it seems they want us to use www . ubswarburg . com / energy . pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy . com tomorrow . he anticipates having resolution by noon . i personally don ' t care much what url we use : the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important . of course , a change in url now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again . . .
2 ) ubs ( in the form of matt meinel , who feels mike hutchins will be in agreement with him ) do not want us to redirect traffic from www . enrononline . com to the new site , as they feel that promotes too much of an association with enron . i disagree with their position , but don ' t think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name . also , the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement .
please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed . we are ready to put the splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow , but these 11 th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and i feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name .

rumors that ferc may issue rulemaking on stronger affiliate codes,"of conduct
as an fyi , our dc office heard today that ferc may issue a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) potentially strengthening affiliate codes of conduct in the natural gas industry on june 25 . the range of outcomes could go from anywhere from simply rationalizing 497 ( natural gas code of conduct ) and 889 ( electric code of conduct ) through full divestiture ( although this is highly unlikely ) .
if this happens , it is most directly the result of the on - going litigation at ferc surrounding el paso merchant ' s use of capacity into california .

Close.  I'm thinking ""added functionality for semicolon alternatives""
rather than the ""replace the semicolon"" stunt that Semi::Semicolons
pulls.  In particular, as long as there's no ambiguity between
prefix:> and postfix:>, I think that it would be quite useful for
postfix:> to act as a semicolon that additionally sets $_ equal to
the expression's value, allowing for a pseudo-Prolog style of syntax
(i.e., the code could include questions as well as declarations and
instructions).

Wait, wait.
I think you are messing things up a little bit...

What Suraj is referring to when he says ""BSD"" is the 3-clause BSD
license[1] (he gave the OSI URL[2] in his original message).  Hence he's
already referring to a BSD license without the OAC (Obnoxious
Advertising Clause).

The 3-clause BSD license is *not* exactly equivalent to the so-called
MIT license (by which, I think, Suraj is referring to the Expat
license[3]).
For instance, the third clause of the 3-clause BSD license (even though
some consider it as a legal no-op...) has no corresponding restriction
in the Expat license.

ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity,"ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 17 , 2001
ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline .
existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities .
"" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] .
existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . ""
given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 .
the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders .
but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted .",0

please find below the last draft copy of the henwood consulting agreement .
we need to sign this asap so as to not be in violation of ene policies .
as you will see , the draft agreement is made out with enron in mind , even
though we have left the company name blank in the agreement .
mohan - last when we spoke ( friday ) , you were going to explore the tax
aspects of having dpc be the signing company . please tell us if that works .
separately , you and wade may need to consider how dpc lenders may look upon
some of the information emerging from this study , and whether you want all of
it in lender domain .
based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be eipl , ene
houston , or dpc . we could also have a version where ene houston is signing
the contract on behalf of dpc .
please let me know what you decide , and we will proceed accordingly . if you
would like someone in eipl / dpc to be signing the contract , please let me
know , who the signing authority is . i suspect , that even i could sign on
behalf of dpc or ene ? ? if so , i will be in houston on wednesday , and sign
at the time . if not , you can assign someone to sign .

time table revisions 3,"ad hoc ' ers :
one last time before we shoot it over to mark and isas . thanks for the
comments , good catches .
>
as far as comment # 1 ( lca vs . ppt vs . pst ) , this gets into the white paper
idea discussed last wednesday . lisa was going to tackle this ( she ' s
given - up sleeping to fit it in ) and i ' d asked her to distinguish between
referencing time in a product definition versus time in a process
description . but i believe she is on vacation fighting forest fires .
this table is used in a process ( submission and assessment of e - tags ) and is
some - what independent of the time zone ( s ) that the product or commodity is
referenced by . guess i ' m letting my preference slip in here - since we are
dealing with a daily process , the timing table should use a prevailing time
reference ( e . g . , lca or ppt , etc . ) and not a "" fixed "" time zone ( e . g . , pst ,
cst , etc . ) .
enough of me , let ' s talk about your comments to the latest table . if there
are none , it ' ll go to mark at cob tuesday july 3 rd .

cal . update 7 / 30 / 01 - direct access,"executive summary
direct access could make a rescue of socal edison more difficult
bond issuances for california may be in jeopardy as direct access becomes more popular with municipalities
municipal power is politically attractive
there is growing pressure across california for cities to consider forming their own municipal power companies . community leaders across the state are enviously eyeing the success of sacramento ' s smud utility and the los angeles municipal power utility , where rate hikes and service disruptions have been far less pronounced than the rest of the state . several leaders in san francisco are considering setting up their own power company , and another two dozen cities are also contemplating action . municipal power companies are not subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission , and could therefore sidestep the current proposed structure of rate hikes .
trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult , as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long - standing privileges in california politics . under california law , it is very difficult to stop many cities from doing what they feel is in their best interest . most older and larger cities are "" charter cities "" rather than "" general law cities "" subject to the california municipal code . under the california constitution , charter cities can pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army . the league of california cities - a weighty organization representing every one of california ' s cities - is already swinging into action to support direct access . most assembly democrats started out as city councilors and have some sympathy with local independence . and the resistance within the assembly is already building against hertzberg ' s attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access .
some city leaders will not wish to fight the governor and the state legislature on the issue . but if municipalities do not opt out , they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company . cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers . politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on this matter , and this could affect campaign contributions .
state power plans at risk
if municipalities do move to set up their own power companies , it could undermine at least three key elements of the state of california ' s power plans :
first , the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users . but municipal power would unpick this structure , allow large regions of california to ignore the puc , leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city . many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes . others might cave into irate voters .
second , the plans laid out by governor davis ' and state treasurer angelides ' for a california state public power authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it . it is possible that long - term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long - term rates by buying on the open market . it could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss .
third , revenues to back the proposed power bond could be imperiled , if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond . and if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state , it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments .
the issue is at an early stage - - the puc had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in san francisco on friday . state legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession , or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away . but stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult .",0

[R] partitioning variation using the Vegan CCA routine?,"Hello
I am using Jari Oksanen's CCA routine from the Vegan package on some estuary
data, following a technique applied in (Anderson, M.J. & Gribble, N.A.,
1998, Partitioning the variation among spatial, temporal and environmental
components in a multivariate data set, Australian Journal of Ecology 23,
158-167).
Some steps in the process require that the dependent matrix be constrained
by one independent matrix, given the affect of another independent matrix.

eg: CCA of species matrix, constrained by the environmental matrix, with
spatial variables treated as covariables
or:  CCA of species matrix, constrained by the temporal matrix, with
environmental and spatial variables treated as covariables

Does anyone know of a partitioning routine able to perform this feat or have
suggestions on how I might approach the problem from scratch?

Cheers
Matt

account as i have a multi - currency account denominated in usd / canadian or
british pounds ( which ever fits you as i may need to pay my counterparts in
the uk ) . . . other than that i have no perplexities .
i will send you my wire instructions later , either my bank in california or
in bermuda .
as i live in california and do contingency search , i must go off of my
client ' s "" good word "" on occasion and luckily haven ' t had any problems so
far . . . i always honor california verbal contract law - if i do not draft .
i think you fee payment of 20 % is generous and the industry standard of 30
day guarantee on replacement is fair . obviously there is no deposit on any
contingency and if there is a definite urgent need for a position to be
filled only then will i ask your help for a minor deposit to aid in my
overhead to shift all my resources to search on behalf on enron .
as enron has the in - house power to probably not need this service then
obviously a deposit will not be required .
if you wish me to send my standard agreement then i will , but you have made
yourself perfectly clear by phone what you are willing to do . i therefore
will be happy to receive you contract and follow your instructions .
i thank you and vince for allowing me to work with enron and pledge to you my
best work and candidates utilizing my network of contacts .
i am very excited about our new relationship and hope to give you my very
best service .
thank you very much for this opportunity molly , please send my your contract
so , that i may sign it and send it right back to you immediately . i am
looking forward to working with vince and you .
thank you again ,
jeff wesley
ps - i can utilize to resources of management recruiters international usa and
robert walters of the uk to aid in my service to you .
best regards ,
jeff wesley

sugar-install-bundle should work if you run it inside the sugar devel 
console (if it doesn't work please open a ticket about it).

Also you can just unzip the .xo in ~/Activities

i do not understand the netco / newco comments .
clearly at this point enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer . that would be a don miller / fallon final call - but i think its a no brainer .

under commitments to pec , enron has commited to provide office , computers , trading systems , etc . if this is changing , i need to know quickly . i have been provided indications from several outside counterparties , some divisions within newco and i thought netco as holding interest in purchasing the chicago business . due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with pec , i believe it imperative that the business / office be operational until march , 2002 , at a minimum .
please advise .

we have asked epsc to pay the following leases for the month of january based on feedback from ena commercial leadership . my understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by feb 2 . i will revisit the status of these leases with you before february rents are to be paid .

var methodology change,"gentlemen ,
below is a plan of action for moving along with the var methodology change
related to forward - forward volatility :
1 . finalize the methodology proposed ( research / market risk )
- determine the time period used to calculated forward - forward vols vs .
correlations ( 20 days vs . 60 days )
- stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does
not change based on historical prices , implying volatility of 0 %
2 . get approval for the methodology change from rick buy ( see draft of the
memo attached ) - john lavorato and john sherriff
3 . develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment

Yet another reason to avoid Perl 5 prototypes (they don't survive the
sub being turned into a reference).  Happily Perl 6 fixes this

pugs> sub foo ($arg) { $arg }
undef
pugs> foo()
*** No compatible subroutine found: ""&foo""
    at line 1, column 1 - line 2, column 1
pugs> foo(""arg"")
""arg""
pugs> my $coderef = \&foo;
sub {Syn ""block"" {Var ""$arg""}}
pugs> $coderef()
*** No compatible subroutine found: ""$coderef""
    at line 1, column 1 - line 2, column 1
pugs> $coderef(""arg"")
""arg""

Admittedly, Pugs isn't doing a good job with the error message yet,
but at least it is working the way one would expect.

Like Paul said, the hash is being treated as an array slice returning
the values for ""jeevan"" and ""Sarika"".

>
> my %hash = (jeevan=>'Ingake', Sarika =>'Bere');
> my @star = %hash{jeevan, Sarika};
> print @star;

The array assignment line produces an error cos the syntax is telling
perl to unwind the entire hash (key-value pairs) but you're passing
keys to hash which under normal use will return the values. To get the
key-value pairs into @star use:

my @star = %hash;

@star will now contain the key-value pairs (Sarika, Bere, jeevan,
Ingake) but the pairs wont be in any particular order.

we have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and / or balance of month trading ( with no forward trading ) . it would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within eol that allowed for better credit screening . we have moved away from the broker markets , and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties .
i would like to get this changed asap , if possible .

as i mentioned to you , due to some recent success in obtaining additional security , we are extending credit to edison mission marketing & trading , inc . to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only . we will not be granting them execution rights on eol due to the lack of controls / functionality for daily transactions . eol , unlike ice , has tenor function set by months versus number of days . as a result , in the case of edison mission , if we set eol for one month , edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month . it seems to make this work for edison and perhaps other potential counterparties , it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions . if you would like to discuss further , please call .

it ' s been a long time since we talked , but i trust that things are well with
you and lea .
the reason for my email is that my business partners sunil hirani and dik
blewitt are going to be in houston visiting with ken lay at 10 : 30 a . m . on
wednesday . i think that you would find their business ( trading credit risk )
to be of interest , and i know they would like to meet you .
would you have any time on your calendar for lunch or for an introduction
during the afternoon ?
briefly , sunil is the co - founder of creditex , a the credit derivatives
trading platform that the market has adopted as the e - market for credit
derivatives . dik is chief strategic officer of creditex .
my relationship with dik and sunil comes from our shared interest in trading
syndicated loans . creditex and i have co - founded loanx , inc . , to do for the
loan market what creditex has done for the credit derivatives market .
sorry for the out - of - the blue email , but i look forward to catching up with
you in the future .
i ' ve copied sunil and dik to facilitate any schedule coordination that might
be possible .
my best to lea .

re : var calibration issues,"we are proposing the following changes to the calculation of ng correlations :
1 . weight the data set ( 3 calendar months ) used in calculating correlations
( most recent data weighed heavier )
2 . use respective contract prices , instead of prompt month prices ( i . e . for
nov - 00 correlations use nov contract prices for the last 3 months , as opposed
to prompt month prices for the last three months .
tanya ,
i have confirmed with ted and he gave us green light to make both changes .
did we get an opinion from vince ?
winston ,
it is my understanding , that this changes apply to ng correlations only , not
the correlations between commodities . we will test the changes in gas and
then decide on world - wide implementation . any estimate on timing of this
implementation ?
cassandra ,
ted suggested that you and veronica should document this as a change in var
parameters and inform all commercial desk heads of these changes . we intend
to make them for na gas first , but ultimately make these changes consistent
across all commodity groups . let me know if you have questions .
thanks , vlady .

vlady ,
also in the meeting , we identified that there are still some issures
regarding to the correlation matrix calculations .
since different commodity has different expiration dates . when calculate
correlation between two commodities , the two may have different prompt
months . are we going to use prices on two different prompt months or are we
going to use the prices on the same month disregarding prompt months .
because above issues , jin is not going do any changes on the correlation
matrix calculation until above issures can be solved .

vlady , we met with winston and jin today regarding var calibration issues .
the outcome on this discussion is :
1 . jin will put weights into calculation of factor loadings ;
2 . jin will change the way factor loading are calculated . for each commodity
the prompt month contract will be selected for the effective date of vatrfacs
run .
then the historical prices will be collected for 3 month for all forward
contracts starting from
selected prompt month contract . the variance - covariance matrix will be
calculated
based on these data , it will be converted into correlation matrix , then
factor loadings
analysis will be performed on the correlation matrix .

I poked around a bit in gdb.  I don't have any answers or patches, but
hopefully a little more information will be helpful.

In Parrot_get_HLL_id, between the 31st and 32nd calls to this function,
the string memory for the ""name"" string, from the ""name_pmc"" PMC, is
freed.  The string pointer is not updated.  So, the next time around,
segfault.


Breakpoint 2, Parrot_get_HLL_id (interp=0x804e008, hll_name=0xb591ebb8) at src/hll.c:191
191         PMC * const hll_info = interp->HLL_info;
(gdb) next 7
207               if (!string_equal(interp, name, hll_name))
(gdb) print name->strstart
$28 = 0xb5607b00 ""106""
(gdb) cont
Continuing.

191         PMC * const hll_info = interp->HLL_info;
(gdb) next 7
207               if (!string_equal(interp, name, hll_name))
(gdb) print name->strstart
$29 = 0xb5607b00 (gdb) next
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Note the pointer value is the same; the first time it's valid and the
string is displayed.  The second time, it's ""out of bounds"".


Valgrind has some very interesting things to say about this test
script, including lots of undefined data warnings, lots of accesses 
outside of allocated ranges, and also such gems as ""definitely lost:
1,476,179 bytes in 13,925 blocks"".  But most importantly, it tells us
what freed the memory:

I don't know *why* it was freed, but at least that tells us *where*.
And parrot -G runs great, of course.
