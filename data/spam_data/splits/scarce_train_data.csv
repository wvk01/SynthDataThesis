subject : silence . . . . . . . . . . . . .
hello ,
as i didn ' t hear anything last week on whether we had made progress on the transfer / sale of the abb turbines ( i know ben was out too ) i thought i would put my thoughts in writing . i am assuming that we are all on board with the fact that transferring these assets to the turbine book is the most efficient mechanism for dealing with the turbines going forward - please let me know if anyone thinks otherwise ( excluding arguments about transfer pricing ) .
transfer abb turbines to the turbine book ( under the management of jacoby and calger ) , capital charges to be picked up by the turbine book as of 7 / 01 / 01 . the turbine book is responsible for the turbines going forward .
should a sale occur ( negotiated by ecc ) to any of the customers outlined in the documents , ecc has the right to buy back the assets at any time at the transfer price plus capital charge incurred during the period when the turbines were owned by the turbine book . the call option expires 9 / 01 / 01 and can only be exercised for a sale to the counterparties in the document attached with the addition of calpine for the purposes of a sale combined with the site ( the call option for a calpine sale is valid until 12 / 01 / 01 ) . if ecc does not wish to pursue the sale to the counterparties in the document attached , then jacoby can pursue these negotiations and if a sale is completed this year with these counterparties , the turbine book will receive a brokerage fee ( $ 1 million ) and ecc will pick up capital costs between 7 / 01 / 01 and the completion of the sale .
please agree to a transfer price for these turbines , if a price cannot be agreed between you , please let me have your arguments substantiating your transfer price and i will arbitrate on the number on friday . let me know if anyone disagrees with moving forward in this way .
regards
louise

fw : beautiful woman ready to cheat,"geronimo !
addi
there is a scarcity of friendship , but not of friends .
colonies do not cease to be colonies because they are independent .
that all men are equal is a proposition to which , at ordinary times , no sane human being has ever given his assent . when we do the best we can , we never know what miracle is wrought in our life , or in the life of another . wise men learn many things from their enemies . today ' s city is the most vulnerable social structure ever conceived by man .
when it is not necessary to change , it is necessary not to change . love him , and keep him for thy friend , who , when all go away , will not forsake thee , nor suffer thee to perish at the last . i think i am a much better actor than i have allowed myself to be .
paris , a city of gaieties and pleasures , where four - fifths of the inhabitants die of grief . [ about paris ] greed , like the love of comfort , is a kind of fear .
there is never a better measure of what a person is than what he does when he is absolutely free to choose . autobiography begins with a sense of being alone . it is an orphan form . look around for a place to sow a few seeds .
a heart well prepared for adversity in bad times hopes , and in good times fears for a change in fortune .
artists to my mind are the real architects of change , and not the political legislators who implement change after the fact .
give me a lever long enough , and a prop strong enough , i can single - handed move the world .
the human race is a race of cowards and i am not only marching in that procession , but carrying a banner .

sounds good ! it will take two or three days for me to strip out , reformat ,
and assemble the kaminski columns ( since we didn ' t do this last year , i ' m
guessing you mean all columns since the beginning ) , so i envision us being
ready with the completed set the first part of next week . i assume that you
would like me to omit those people who have moved on ?
also , on page three of the first volume , you had written an introduction . i
have updated the content for volume two , but would you perhaps like to do a

FROM ALFRED FIFAJI,"FROM ALFRED FIFAJI
THE HEAD OF FILE DEPARTMENT, AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
COTONOU, BENIN REPUBLIC, WEST AFRICA
TELEPHONE: 00229 97071419
STRICTLY PERSONAL
I am Alfred Fifaji, Head of Files/Records Department and Debt  
Recovering Unit in the African Development Bank, Cotonou, Benin  
Republic in West Africa.
Firstly, I must solicit your explicit confidence in this  
transaction.This is by virtue of  its nature as being utterly  
confidential and top secret. However, after series of petitions have  
been received by this regime from Foreign Contractors regarding the  
inability of the African Development Bank to settle all outstanding  
debts owed to Foreign Contractors, a committee (which I was the  
head)was set up to carefully review all overdue debts owed to foreign  
contractors and recommend for immediate release of such funds with  
immediate effect.
During the investigation period, we discovered an abandoned sum of 35   
Million (Thirty five million United States Dollars) belonging to a  
German business magnate and property consultant, Late Andreas  
Schranner. The late Mr Schranner died in a plane crash on Monday, 31st  
July, 2000 alongside his family members. The BBC website  
refers:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
Since we got information over his sudden death the bank has made  
frantic efforts to locate his reltions, but all attempts failed. The  
bank cannot release this funds to anyone except it receives an  
application from anybody who would stand as the next of kin or  
business partner to the late customer.
It was based on this discovery that my collegues and I conceived the  
idea of contacting you, based on the good recommendation given to me  
by a friend who works with the chamber of commerce and industries  
here. We do not want the funds to be shared by the board of directors  
of the bank who may wake up one day to declare it ""unclaimed funds"".  
We need your unflinching support and cooperation to have the funds  
transferred to your nominated bank account. Please, note that upon the  
successful transfer of the funds to your bank account, you shall be  
entitled to 25% of the total funds as your share. I shall at a  
subsequent date come to your country to open an account where I will  
deposit our 75% of the funds.
Having done a thorough feasibility study on how to perfect the  
transfer of the funds to your bank account, your role shall be to send  
an application for claim of the funds to the bank as a next of kin or  
business partner to the late Andreas Schranner. I also would require  
your contact address, telephone and fax numbers for easy  
communication. Please, rest assured that the business is 100% risk free.
Upon receiving your response to this proposal, I would be most obliged  
to send to you a text of application for claim of the funds which you  
will send to the bank. Please, bear in mind that with your strong  
obedience to my guidance in this transaction, the funds would be  
transferred to your account within 14 working days.
I look forward to receiving your urgent response.
Best wishes,
Alfred Fifaji",1
stephen bennett,"stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research
group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment
criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a
senior specialist .
after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an
"" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of
a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of
this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""
at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron
designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar
hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,
who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while
functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job
classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional
professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the
proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist
category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected
at this time .
although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work
experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the
weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in
atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,
needing no further training and only minimal supervision .
once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron
values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather
briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation
as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .
stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he
designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather
derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and
liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion
and major upgrade of this web page .
these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,
to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the
advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily
on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his
supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do
not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations
assistance .
in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was
enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a
meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional
title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving
of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

[Mhln] It really improves erection...,"Content-Type: text/plain;
    charset=""iso-8859-1""
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

 Restore your sex life, or just give it a little kick.

Erectile dysfunction (ED), sometimes referred to as impotence, is the inability
for a sexually active male to obtain and sustain an erection for sexual
purposes. In the past, this has been very embarrassing for men, and a source
of anxiety for their partners, and, in fact, there has been very little
diagnostic testing or treatment options available until very recently.

Viagra can help you!

The benefits of Viagra:

 Helps men with ED achieve harder erections  Helps men with ED maintain
an erection during sex  Can work in as little as 14 minutes  Viagra-induced
erections satisfy the partners of men with ED  Has a proven safety record
 Works for men with ED who also have a wide range of health issues  Can
be taken with other medications  As safe for your heart as a sugar pill

Possible Fix?,"OK, so I'm a fresh user but I've had this problems with other installs/distros so it's a fairly common and well known bug - however I think I may have fixed it using the newest Xine library RPM and Kaffeine (even under gnome). Totem still doesn't work, and that's fine with me. What I noticed was that on my Windows XP share where I had enabled everyone access (i.e. - Everyone had RWE access) I was able to stream to Kaffeine just fine, but on the SMB share from another Linux platform it would give me the same error you're getting.

My thought was that Kaffeine didn't have permissions on that drive even though I had logged in to the network share through the file browser. So I changed the share properties to allow everyone access without putting in a password. When I ran the files now by right-clicking and choosing ""Open with Kaffeine"" it worked!

I then tested the opposite - If I changed the properties on my Windows XP share to allow only one user access I could easily put in my username/password and browse the share but I could not play files in kaffeine or any other media player for that matter.

So the end result is this - whether you're using a windows machine as the host or a linux machine as the host you have to open your permissions to allow full unrestricted access to the share without a password. This solution worked for me, let me know if that also works for you.

[R]  LME: internal workings of QR factorization --repost,"Hi:

I've been reading ""Computational Methods for Multilevel Modeling"" by Pinheiro and Bates, 
the idea of embedding the technique in my own c-level code. The basic idea is to rewrite 
the joint density in a form to mimic a single least squares problem conditional upon the 
variance parameters.  The paper is fairly clear except that some important level of detail 
is missing. For instance, when we first meet Q_(i):

/                    \                  /                                 \
| Z_i     X_i   y_i  |                  | R_11(i)     R_10(i)     c_1(i)  |
|                    | =         Q_(i)  |                                 |
| Delta   0     0    |                  |   0         R_00(i)     c_0(i)  |
\                    /                  \                                 /

the text indicates that the Q-R factorization is limited to the first q columns of the 
augmented matrix on the left.  If one plunks the first q columns of the augmented matrix 
on the left into a qr factorization, one obtains an orthogonal matrix Q that is (n_i + q) x q 
and a nonsingular upper triangular matrix R that is q x q.  While the text describes R as a 
nonsingular upper triangular q x q, the matrix Q_(i) is described as a square (n_i + q) x (n_i + q) 
orthogonal matrix.  The remaining columns in the matrix to the right are defined by applying 
transpose(Q_(i)) to both sides.  The question is how to augment my Q which is orthogonal (n_i + q) x q  
with the missing (n_i + q) x n_i portion producing the orthogonal square matrix mentioned in the text?  
I tried appending the n_i x n_i identity matrix to the block diagonal, but this doesn't work as the 
resulting likelihood is insensitive to the variance parameters.

ken rice received a call through a friend ' s referral from dr . tom limperis ( a professor at the university of michigan ) . dr . limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show enron . ken would like you to return this call on his behalf . he feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if enron should have an interest .
do you mind returning this call ? please let me know .

hi ! !,"hello there mister bill !
just a quick note to say sorry for getting off of the phone so quickly
yesterday ! to get into my apartment you have to go through a security gate
that needs to be opened by a resident . i didn ' t have my pass code and i had
a visitor . so i was scrammbling around like a lunatic trying to find it .
most everyone who comes to visit knows the pass code so when someone new
comes to visit i have to try to remember what it is ! then enter it into the
phone to let them in ! i think i ' ve used it like twice in the year i ' ve
lived here ! anyhow so that ' s that !
to be quite honest with you i was so frazzled that i have no idea what you
said you needed to do or if you said i could call back after a certain time .
my mind was just focused on that code ! i thought i remembered that you
couldn ' t talk to me the rest of the day . that ' s why i didn ' t call . ok
there ' s all the excuses and apologies .
hope you ' re having a great day !

You're facing two problems: the return value for system() needs to be 
shifted right by eight bits; and that value is provided in ""unsigned"" 
form, so you have to massage it:

my $code = system(...);
$code = unpack 'c', pack 'c', $code >> 8;
if ($code == -3) {
}

Read ""perldoc -f system""

New Revision: 22775

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=22775

Log:
For the cluster code I've developed a wrapper around tdb to put different
database backends in place dynamically.

The main abstractions are db_context and db_record, it should be mainly
self-describing, see include/dbwrap.h.  You open the db just as you would open
a tdb, this time with db_open(). If you want to fetch a record, just do the
db->fetch() call, if you want to do operations on it, you need to get it with
fetch_locked().

I added dbwrap_file.c (not heavily tested lately) as an example for what can
be done with that abstraction, uses a file per key. So if anybody is willing
to shape that up, we might have a chance on reiserfs again.... :-)

This abstraction works fine for brlock.tdb, locking.tdb, connections.tdb and
sessionid.tdb. It should work fine for the others as well, I just did not yet
get around to convert them.

If nobody loudly screams NO, then I will import the code that uses this soon.

pnm terminates merger with western resources
albuquerque , n . m . - based pnm resources announced tuesday its board had
officially killed the proposed deal to buy western resources ' electric
utility subsidiaries . the deal , originally valued at over $ 4 billion , had
been in trouble for months , and each side sued the other in state court in
new york . pnm said the merger could be terminated after dec . 31 under the
terms of the deal , if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards
completing the transaction . but western has disputed that pnm had grounds to
back out of the deal . pnm sued western in october seeking to get out of the
deal alleging breach of contract , in part because of adverse rulings from
the kansas corporation commission ( kcc ) on rates and a western restructuring
plan considered vital to the transaction .
western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later , seeking at least $ 650
million in damages against pnm for alleged extortion , breach of contract ,
sabotage and improper interference in the kcc proceedings . neither case has
been decided , although pnm has asked the court to either dismiss western ' s
case or delay action on it until after it has decided pnm ' s initial suit .
western also has appealed the kcc order blocking a planned restructuring in
preparation for the pnm transaction to a kansas district court . western

review of disposed assets for residual value and / or potential,"exposure
louise : attached is an excel file which lists the results of our search for residual assets or old assets with potential exposure . most of the assets on this list are currently being monitored by special assets or energy capital resources . we included these assets on the list because they have not been very visible and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of their existence . however , also included on the list are 3 to 4 transactions similar to midwest gas storage in that it appears that they have not been on anyone ' s radar screen . the scope of our review did not include any former enron international assets now managed by wholesale through the global assets group .
our list is divided into 3 parts : 1 ) retained assets , 2 ) bankruptcy / guarantor claims , 3 ) transactions requiring legal documentation / closure . the bankruptcy / guarantor list is not an all inclusive list of bankruptcies for wholesale but includes those merchant portfolio bankruptcies with a low probability of recovery which are , of course , not a high priority for legal . we just want to make sure they don ' t completely disappear from our scrutiny . you will also note that there are a couple of assets that require further review and we will advise you when we make a final determination .
finally , we will take steps to include these assets in future portfolio reporting so that they can be closely monitored .
many thanks to dick lydecker ' s group and legal for their assistance to rac in reviewing numerous disposed assets that resulted in this list . please call if you have questions . regards ! rick c .",0

[R] Configuring R-2.5.0 for X11 on Red Hat WS 4 x86-64,"I have been unable to configure R-2.5.0 for the X11 interface on Red 
Hat WS 4 x86-64 (AMD Opteron).

The configure script looks for XtToolkitInitialize in libXt, and does 
not find it because it's not in libXt (which is present, however).

I tried installing openmotif and openmotif-devel, and that is no help.

How do I configure the X11 interface under this situations?

Thanks,
Bruce

I think you'll find that syntax is incorrect.

And map in void context is generally frowned upon.

  modify_variable $$_ for \($var1, $var2, $var3);

Or assign it back to $$_ if that is necessary.  If you're passing in a
reference is probably isn't.  And given the name of the function, it
probably shouldn't be.

Re: [R] Viewing a data object,"Hi Horace,

I have also thought that it may be useful but I don't know of any Object
Explorer available for R.

However, (you may alread know this but) 
(1) you can view your list of objects in R with objects(), 
(2) view objects in a spreadsheet-like table (if they are matrices or data
frames) with invisible(edit(objectName)) [which isn't easy on the fingers].
fix(objectName) is also a shorter option but it has the side effect of
possibly changing your object when you close the viewing data. For instance,
this can happen if you mistakenly type something into a cell; it can also
change your column classes when you don't - for example:

> options(stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
> x  sapply(x,class)
letters.1.5.         X1.5 
    ""factor""    ""integer"" 
> fix(x) # no user-changes made
> sapply(x,class)
letters.1.5.         X1.5 
    ""factor""    ""numeric"" 

(3) I believe Deepayan Sarkar contributed the tab-completion capability at
the command line. So unless you have a lot of objects beginning with
'AuroraStoch...' you should be able to type a few letters and let the
auto-completion handle the rest.

Best regards,

ST

Re: [R] Fine tunning rgenoud,"Paul,

It should be easy enough to check that your solution is valid (i.e. a local
minimum):  first, check to see if the solution satisfies all the
constraints; secondly, check to see if it is an interior point (i.e. none of
the constraints become equality); and finally, if the solution is an
interior point, check to see whether the gradient there is close to zero.
Note that if the solution is one of the vertices of the polyhedron, then the
gradient may not be zero.

Thanks, Ravi. I had already conceived the solution that you suggest,
actually using ""lpSolve"". I am able to get a solution for my problem
with constrOptim, but I am not enough confident that the solution is
right. That is why I am trying to get a solution with rgenoud, but
unsuccessfully until now.

subject : transwestern capacity release report for february 2002 reservation invoices
attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for january 2002 capacity release transactions . if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me .
fyi - based on the flash invoices i generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts , please note the following :
ena k # 24924 res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50 / 50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to burlington
conoco k # 20748 res - delete the thoreau to e . thoreau line item
conoco k # 20835 comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
texaco k # 25923 / 25924 comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4 . 5 % between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes , there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding . need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes ; and if delivery makeup scheduled , then invoice should be adjusted accordingly .
please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2 / 26 / 02 . i will review again on the lst .
schedulers - please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [ some contracts are based on calculations , especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage ] .

thanks ,
elizabeth

Re: [R] fitting mixed models to censored data?,"Hi Bill,

Thanks for your reply.  The first place I looked was in
the survival package since it can obviously handle 
censored data.  However, I don't have any particular desire
to restrict myself to standard survival models just because
I have some censoring.  Frailties appear to fit in nicely
with the types of models typically used with survival data,
but that's not the only kind of model I'd like to look at.

Thanks,
Spie

tw bullets 2 / 9,"capacity marketing - we negotiated an extension of the 400 , 000 mmbtu / d
east - to - east contract with aquila / usgt this week plus improved the
economics of their existing contract . the extension , beginning november
2001 , has a reservation rate of $ . 025 / mmbtu with a 30 % sharing of the permian
to cal border index spreads on all alternate westward flow . as for their
existing contract , we negotiated a $ . 15 / mmbtu rate effective february 15 -
october 31 , 2001 on the alternate west flow , an improvement of $ . 11 / mmbtu .
in addition , we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with
astra power llc . their reservation rate is $ . 0325 / mmbtu on a volume of
50 , 000 / d for a term of march 2001 through march 2003 .
with the execution of these two deals plus the anticipated closing of the
public service of new mexico contract , this will effectively sell out the
east end of the tw system through at least 2002 .
san juan flow conditioner - the decision was made this week to postpone till
march the application of the exxon / nalco flow conditioner in the san juan
lateral . had we proceeded with the application in february ( a tariff month ) ,
the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been $ 300 , 000 .
southwest gas - we received the fully executed oba contract from southwest
gas this week .
gas inventory - with moderating temperatures out west reducing demand and
shippers paying gas back to tw , we were experiencing high linepack for most
of the week . tw was able to sell 55 , 000 mmbtu at the border for a net
revenue of $ 453 , 000 .
reliant - we negotiated a san juan pool contract for 20 , 000 mmbtu / d at max
rates for february 6 - 28 . reliant is flowing alternate out of path from san
juan to the border and scheduling 5 , 000 to 12 , 000 mmbtu / d . incremental
revenue for this could range from $ 42 , 000 to $ 100 , 000 for the month .",0

retail markets conference,"i would like to invite you to participate in a conference on "" retail
participation in competitive power markets "" to be held at stanford
university on june 21 - 22 , 2001 . although california and other regional
markets will likely be introducing some demand - response programs by june ,
there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to
transform the market . the conference provides an opportunity to learn from
different experiences .
this policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for
understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and
to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend
directions for additional research and analysis . participants will come
from companies , government , and universities . you can obtain more
information about the conference by checking under "" meetings "" on our emf
website listed below .
please let me know if you plan on attending . also , if you would like to
make a brief 15 - minute presentation , please let me know your topic and
describe it in a few sentences . i will try to choose speakers that will
cover the full range of interests represented by this group . researchers
should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand
response programs rather than on the technical details of their
methodology . i would also encourage practitioners to discuss their
experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected
issues .

california update - - 10 . 02 . 01 : puc turns down davis ' proposed rate,"agreement with dwr
in what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event , the california puc today voted down davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc .
the vote was 4 - 1 , with the two republicans voting with davis ' hand - picked appointees lynch and wood .
davis ' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another davis appointee - - geoff brown - - who made a lengthy speech about why california would experience economic and political destruction if the puc did not approve davis ' proposed rate agreement .
what is davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc ?
it would remove all puc authority to review any contracts between dwr with suppliers .
it would require the puc to pass through to utility rates all dwr power contract costs , no questions asked .
what are the implications of the move by the puc to reject davis ' proposal ?
with the vote , it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the dwr power contracts .
the political pressure to re - negotiate - - or break - - the dwr power contracts is likely to intensify considerably .
it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months .
under the structure devised by davis , the revenues flowing from the cpuc / dwr rate agreement would be used to both 1 ) pay for the dwr power contracts and 2 ) service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay california ' s general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since january .
in short , there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds .
safe to say that today ' s puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis , and left his approach to "" solving "" california electricity crisis in shambles .
what next ?
a broad left - right coalition of energy interests supported a bill ( 18 xx ) that passed the legislature with broad bi - partisan support .
the bill would create a "" dedicated rate component "" on every customers bill to service the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue .
proponents of the bill - - and just about everyone else - - argue that the "" dedicated rate component "" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget .
the bill is silent , however , on how california would pay for the dwr contracts , and the bill ' s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result .
all four puc commissioners who voted against the davis rate agreement today urged davis to sign the bill . the left - right coalition ( from nader types to oil companies ) is also working hard to get davis to sign it .
davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the treasurer and bond counsel .
given today ' s vote , however , davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid .
update on edison bailout
still appears that chances are very small that edison and davis will succeed in getting the legislature to vote for an edison bailout when it returns for another "" special "" session next tuesday .
if you have any questions , just let us know .
best ,

subject : management conference - business unit panel
hello all ,
i ' m planning the agenda for this year ' s management conference . i ' ve been working on the upcoming meeting since march , but as you can imagine , the direction has changed several times .
we are delighted to have general norman schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership , and gary hamel returning to help us process the past year . while we have arranged an all - star line up of outside speakers , we also want to focus on what is happening inside enron . rather than having only one or two business presentations , mark frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate .
currently , the panel is scheduled to take place 8 : 00 - 9 : 30 am on friday , november 16 . please plan to present a very high level overview of your business . you are welcome to use powerpoint slides , but in the interest of time , presentations must be no more than 10 minutes . mark will introduce each of you , interject questions , encourage interaction , and ensure we stay on time .
below is the proposed order for your presentations . regardless of your place in the rundown , you will need to be seated on stage by 7 : 50 am and equipped with a microphone . because we have a full agenda that morning , we will try to begin the session promptly at 8 : 00 am .
stan horton - global services
louise kitchen - americas
john sherriff - europe
mike mcconnell - global markets
jeff mcmahon - industrial markets
janet dietrich - retail
if you elect to use a powerpoint presentation , please forward it to me electronically by friday , november 9 or provide the presentation to me on cd at the management conference . to ensure consistancy , i ' ve attached a powerpoint template that i would like you to use .
>
finally , mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4 : 00 pm on wednesday , november 14 following your arrival at the management conference . the meeting will take place in the library off the main lobby of the westin la cantera . in the meantime , if you have any questions or need any assistance , please contact me . i look forward to working with you .
regards ,

urgent response,"dear sir / madam ,
you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you don ' t know me personally . i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr . john da costa , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe , i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you . my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority . before his death he deposited the sum of us $ 15 . 2 million ( fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars ) to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe .
the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "" modus operandi "" adopted by the government .
this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely ; more than fifty - one ( 51 ) people have so far been killed . heads of governments from the west , especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan , subsequently , south african development community ( s . a . d . c . ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land act , it is against this background that i and my
family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband ' s money into a foreign account . as a family , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account , where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth .
and south africa ' s government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "" asylum "" . as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter .
for your assistance , i will offering you 15 % of the total sum , 80 % for my family while 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction . i wish to
invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice .
finally , all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company ' s account in your country .
if this proposal is acceptable by you , please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number + 27724263169 or e - mail address mariadacosta _ 2002 @ yahoo . com

What led you to believe that?  There is nothing in that regex that
says ""stop after the first newline""

> tell regex at multiple lines for match.

That is the mnemonic device, yes, but what it actually does is allow
the ^ token to match after a newline and the $ character to match
before a newline, rather than just the beginning and end of string.
So effectively, ^ and $ match the beggining/ending of lines, rather
than strings.

Your regexp does not involve ^ or $, so /m is completely irrelevent.

If you remove the /g modifier, your pattern matches only once.
Regardless of any other modifiers, if you want to search for more than
one occurrence of the pattern, you need the /g modifier.

> Also when I replace /g with /s, I still get output ""once""

Again, without the /g modifier, the pattern matches only once.  /s is
also irrelevant.  While the mnemonic for this one is ""single line"",
what it actually does is allow the . wildcard to match any character
including the newline.  Normally it matches any character except the
newline.  Again, you have no . in your pattern, so /s is irrelevant.

> Can someone demystify this for me ?
> Is my assumption that regex will stop after encountering first newline is
> applicable only when dot* type of regex is used ?

Ah.  Now I understand your confusion.  It is not the regexp that stops
matching.  It is the . wildcard.  The . does not match a newline
character, unless you provide the /s modifier.  Therefore, the string
""onex\ntwox"" will match /o(.*)x/ by setting $1 to 'on'.  This is what
you've interpreted by ""stopping after the first newline"".  The regexp
engine didn't stop.  It's just that the . ran out of sequential
characters that it could match.  If you add the /s modifier, then $1
will become ""nex\ntwo"", because now the . wildcard will match the
newline.

Indeed you could (lmer reports _an approximation_ to the AIC), but AIC 
comparison between these two models is not valid as whereas they are 
tested, the smaller model is on the boundary of the parameter space for 
the larger one, and that violates one of the assumptions in the derivation 
of AIC.  From simulation studies I have heard seminar talks about, it 
makes a large practical difference as well.

Withou knowing why Anna-Maria wants to 'compare two models', I could not 
begin to offer advice.  Generally one should test how well each does the 
task to hand, whatever that is.
