please kindly assist,"greetings ,
i am prince fayad w . bolkiah , the eldest son of prince jefri bolkiah , former finance minister of brunei , the tiny oil - rich sultanate on the northern coast of the island of borneo , in eastern asia . i will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history , which has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother , the sultan of brunei sheik muda hassanal bolkiah .
as you may know from the international media , the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of us $ 14 . 8 billion dollars . this was as a result of the asian financial crisis that made my father company amedeo development company and government owned brunei investment company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office . however my father was kept under house arrest , his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate .
furthermore , during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives , but before i could do that i was placed under house arrest by the sultan and i have no access to a phone but i have a palm v hand - held computer from which i am sending you this mail . before my incaceration , i went ahead to dispatch the sum of fifty eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars us $ 58 . 5 million in cash under special arrangement into the custody of a private security and trustee company for safe keeping abroad .
hence i seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family abroad . i have decided to offer 10 % of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation .
please i count on your absolute confidentiality , transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this business transaction .
i remain yours sincerely .

Dear customer.Many people say that saving money on medications is impossible without risking your health. However, our licensed CanadianPharmacy proves that it's not right.Most online drugstores sell low-quality drugs manufactured at underground factories in Latin America and Asia.

subject : publishable research . . . . . .
hi grant ,
thanks for writing . i have attached my resume and
transcripts for your perusal .
as you can see , my background is not finance . i became
interested in finance via trading the markets . so my
research interests initially revolved around the central
concept of trading . . . . pricing , technical type thinking ,
insider transactions , volume , and such . but with exposure ,
my interests have grown and i have discovered that i really
enjoy economics . also there are many issues in finance
that sound interesting as i am exposed to them . the point
is , i am too early in my career to set strict limits on my
interests .
my goals are to get introduced to research and to new
ideas , to associate with good people , and to work on
strengthening my weaknesses . i am interested in starting
to build a network within the field of finance and
especially quantitative finance . ultimately , i have to
prepare myself for independent research in order to succeed
in my field .
this brings me to my final point . publications are
important for me . thus i would want to work on topics that
enron would be willing to publish . i would be willing to
work on proprietary models , as long as there was a portion
of the research that could be written up for publication
without jeapordizing the proprietary aspects of the model .
just to let you know . i was not in dr . kao ' s energy class .
i took his stochastic processes class . dr . kao just
mentioned your talk to me as he thought i might be
interested in meeting you and learning more about what is
being done at enron .
thanks again . if you need any more info or want anything
clarified , just write me .

in additon to the 188 , 371 , 296 property value for bammel lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for bammel gas storage of 267 , 000 , 000 . requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with aep not enron and thus the 2002 plan premium allocations of $ 754 , 096 on the bammel gas storage 267 , 000 , 000 value and $ 924 , 433 on the bammel lease value of 188 , 371 , 296 should not be needed .

as discussed for the purposes of the 2002 insurance budget , we will delete the bammel lease ( 1409 ) property values of $ 188 , 371 , 296 . we will advise the insurers effective this past june to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund . however , as respects asset divestitures , insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience . however , if we are successful in receiving a credit , we will refund the premium .
i will discuss with karen and brian the other remaining assets .

It is no longer inefficient; however, it is still an abuse of map and
longer than the for loop version.  It is hard to defend the use of map
in a void context.

Running a personal domain,"Hiya,
    I recently bought the domain name blindlinux.com from a registrar and set it's DNS and such using the control panel they provide.  I'm also allowed a virtual private server for my site and such, which I can access via SSH.  I guess I have a desire to learn how all that works internally.  I'm not gonna run a massive site off it or anything, but maybe host some files and just a personal page.
I was wondering if anybody here is familiar with Cent OS.  I'm not, though have heard it's based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  I'm not familiar with Red Hat in general.
Any tips from anybody?
Thanks muchly,
Zack.
PS: I wish I could host it myself, but I'd need to talk to my ISP about getting a static IP, and anyway it isn't my connection.

[R]  - ICA for less common data,"Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi everyone,

I am not sure this is the appropriate list I should put this question to, 
but I hope you will re-direct me to the most appropriate one if necessary.

I am doing an independent component analysis on a dataset that represents 
different metrics for patchreefs such as depth, area, volume, relative 
relief, shape index and rugosity. Doing different multivariate analyses and 
correlations among variables we discovered that the average reef depth data 
is heavily bi-modal, and rugosity behaves differently in each of the depth 
populations. Other reef metrics behave differently with depth as well. Since 
not all metrics are really independent we did a PCA analysis followed by 
cluster analysis and we tried to compare the results with the results from 
the depth analysis. It was not too conclusive I am afraid, and trying to 
understand the results I came across independent component analysis (ICA).

So .. Ive run it on a combination of principal components and it seems 
that certainly we have 2 independent components that keep popping up (if I 
can use this expression) when we run the analysis with 2, 3, or 4 
components. So I guess these 2 components are the strongest ones . If I can 
say so. My next question is . How can I relate these 2 components to the 
initial data??? Ive plotted each component and if I add a loess line to 
each, visually it seems that one independent component is an unknown 
function of rugosity while the other component is an unknown function of 
reef geometry and depth. But, of course, I would like something more than a 
visual similarity. Also the 2 independent components seem to split the data 
in 3 classes, rather than 2, as the analysis of the depth data suggested. 
Looking back at the depth histogram it is obvious that there are some data 
that actually are not quite modeled by the 2 mixing functions I came up 
with. These data correspond to the deepest patch reefs, a category clearly 
singled out by ICA classification. The bottom line is that I am trying to 
understand what each independent component tells me about the patch reefs 
and how I can relate that to the patch reef morphometrics, biology, other 
factors that impact some reefs but not others, etc.

If you have any clarifying thoughts or if you know about any other 
literature about the subject that can help (except articles that deal with 
ICA and image analysis or wave form data) I will really appreciate.

Thank you very much for your consideration,

Monica

"[R] Setting a minimum number of observations within an individual
	cluster","Hi

I'm trying to cluster a continuous dataset with a varying number of clusters and with a restriction that each cluster must have more than 'x' number of observations. 

I have tried the clara function, using silhouette to give me the neighbouring cluster mediod of each observation, then merging an observation from a cluster with less than 'x' obs. into its' neighbour, but this comes unstuck if their neighbours also have less than 'x' obs.

So I'm fiddling with dendrogram objects.  Is there any way of using the 'members' attribute to cut a dendrogram to only include branches with more than 'x' members?

An example output from clara with a data set of 1000 obs. and 82 clusters

It's possible that grml didn't detect your sound card, or if you have
multiple sound cards in your system, it's using a card other than the
one your speakers are hooked up to. While software speech on a livecd
is pretty good, it still isn't perfect.

Re: [R] Difference between prcomp and cmdscale,"Hi Michael,

Doubtless Professor Ripley did; but it helps to put your back into it.  Long
ago Gower (1966) drew attention to the links between PCA and classical
scaling.  It took me a few seconds to find this:

http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980JJ08200001.pdf

Of course, I knew about Gower.  But I knew about Gower because I had done
the _basic_ research on these methods.  And that was my point.  In a later
paper Gower argued that classical scaling extended, and was more powerful
than, PCA.

However, classical scaling operates on [a matrix of] similarities between
observations/individuals/rows, whereas PCA operates on [a matrix of]
similarities between variables/descriptors/columns.  This means that in
classical scaling the axes cannot be interpreted; often one does  a PCA to
get at these.

HTH, bestR,
Mark.

Re: [R] Character coerced to factor and I cannot get it back,"Just one caveat.  I personally would try to avoid using
global options since it can cause conflicts when
two different programs assume two different settings

Re: Debian install with Software Speech?,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Also, I doubt the kernel console approach would work with a usb to 232
converter, unless the debian netinst iso loads up the drivers for
those as part of the boot process. Even if it does, the debian
installer is dialog based rather than being command-based.

Dear customer.Many people say that saving money on medications is impossible without risking your health. However, our licensed CanadianPharmacy proves that it's not right.Shopping for medications on the Web is really convenient but you should also pay a lot of attention to the quality and the price of product offered. At CanadianPharmacy you will always be able to find drugs of 100% generic quality. CanadianPharmacy we don't save on our clients.Hope that you find this advice useful. CanadianPharmacy is waiting.Sincerely yours,Merle Holley

re [ 9 ] :,we get on well pam anderson review disneychyna i ' ll take it like this,1
update,"here ' s just a quick summary of what we have going on . . . ( not sure how quick
this is going to be ! )
enrononline
offering products on other exchanges ( houstonstreet and true quote ) . we are
going to offer specific products ( various gas and power products ) to
customers who have execute rights to these products on these two platforms .
therefore , we will have three feeds to deal with and will need new
applications built to support the interfaces . we will be responsible for
adding / deleting products , ensuring the sites match ours , reporting trades on
these systems , bridging applicable data to downstream systems , etc . enron
gets an equity ownership in the platforms depending on activity .
opening up enrononline to brokers . we are negotiating with three brokers
right now . they will have to pay a one year licensing fee to have access to
the site , and we will allow them to transact for specific counterparties
only . we will also need applications built and establish specific processes
to support this .
wish list - we have a list of approx . 180 times that we need the developers
to work on for us . jay webb committed to louise a few weeks back ( when i was
in her office ) that we would get a resource ( specifically chris luttrel and
his team ) . i think you are aware of this . chris is now moving on to do
something else and none of our items have been addressed in three weeks . we
have had weekly meetings the last three weeks with the it team ( mark dilworth
and company . . . ) . basically , since mark has decided to leave the group ,
nothing is being addressed . i am going to speak to dave tomorrow about this
and escalate from there necessary . this needs a more detailed explanation -
i am going to try to get some time with you next week .
steel - i will discuss with dave tomorrow . he basically told me not to do
anything ( another topic of discussion . . . . )
we are working on enhancing our existing intranet site for the pcg
louise has asked that i not allocate any of the pcg time to europe - i don ' t
agree with this because i have four people preparing the management report on
a daily basis and i have a call center that also supports europe . i tried to
argue my point but did not get very far : ) i am going to talk to dave about
it some more .
working on bridging to thunderball and the new weather application
legal / credit - we do not always get timely responses from the groups - credit
is improving ( they hired a new person ) , but legal has one person responsible
for new cp set up ( tana jones ) . when she is out , all application processing
stops . i am going to talk to mark taylor about appointing a back up at a
minimum . tana does a great job , but our activity is really increasing ( she
also supports clickpaper ) , so it is becoming an issue .
we have set another record today - we have already done 3 , 358 trades ! ! ! !
no new news from canada on power trading - legal needs to sign off . in mark
taylor ' s shop
argentina in the works - probably end of month .
clickpaper
we have so much , i am not sure where to start . i had lunch today with jeff
harbert to discuss what our needs were . we need tools from reporting to
credit . . .
the commercial group is really wanting to start offering more products , and
are starting to hire marketing people and traders . the activity is really
picking up
the contractors are working weekends ( call center ) . i am working the
commercial group to discontinue this . we are not even getting that many
calls during the week , and we have not received one call on sat / sun since
launch ( july )
commodity logic
dale has been very involved in all the discussions and has been a great
resource ( i have received several compliments from the networks team on his
contribution )
they have not yet released the first module ( financial mgmt - cfo ) . should
be very soon
dealbench
no external customers - very slow developing . . . . staying involved and in
touch with the commercial team
other
i am still looking for an assistant . i sent five resumes down to staffing
and a week later the interviews were not scheduled . i went down to complain
and two of them were scheduled . a week later , the other three were yet to
be scheduled , so i am doing it myself . i think we have some real issues in
the staffing group - this is not the first time .
we are working on disaster recovery for the group .
super saturday - i would like our team to participate . do you have an idea
of who all is interviewing ? we would like to be involved .
we are looking at holiday coverage now to ensure we have coverage
i talked to mary sloan ( sap ) and keith clark ( call center ) is working with
her . i think she really appreciates the help / input .
have you had a chance to review the announcement letter re : reorg ?
sorry for the long - winded message . . . .
thanks ! talk to you soon .

subject : garp 2001 convention
dear garp 2001 speaker
?
this is just a quick note to keep you up - to - date with developments at the
garp 2001 convention , which will be held in new york between 12 th and 15 th
february , 2001 .
?
thus far , garp 2001 looks set to far exceed our expectations and garp 2000 .
there has been a great deal of interest in the 2001 convention . delegate
bookings have been much higher than this time last year . as a result , we are
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention earlier this year .
the three workshops and the one - day asset management forum are also very
well received and will probably reach full capacity . i will of course
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the event .
?
regarding the event itself , i would like a few outstanding issues :
?
1 . presentations : can you please e - mail your presentation to me by 15 th
december , so that i have enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the convention . ( given the break of the christmas and new
york period , and that the event is being held in new york , i am sure you can
appreciate that there are certain logistical factors that need to be taken
into account , hence the reason why the presentations are required as soon as
possible ) . this is purely for reproduction , we also request you bring your
presentation to the convention on the day in either a floppy disc or a
laptop .
?
2 . audio - visual requirements : can you please inform me of what audio - visual
requirements you may have ( 35 mm slides ; ohp ; lcd projection - notably
powerpoint ) .
?
3 . check list : i have attached a check list for your information . if you
have not returned this already , can you please read and fax it to my
colleague , claire as soon as possible .
?
if you have any questions or queries , please do not hesitate to contact me ,
otherwise i eagerly await your response in due course .
?
i look forward to seeing you in new york in february .
?
kind regards
?

[R] sem vs. LISREL: sem fails,"I am new to R. 
I just tried to recreate in R (using sem package and the identical input data) a solution for a simple measurment model I have found before in LISREL. LISREL had no problems and converged in just 3 iterations. 
In sem, I got no solution, just the warning message:

""Could not compute QR decomposition of Hessian.
Optimization probably did not converge.
 in: sem.default(ram = ram, S = S, N = N, param.names = pars, var.names = vars, ""

What does it mean? Maybe I am doing something wrong?

Old Witchcraft Secrets - make your wildest dreams come true,"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""iso-8859-1""

""Old Witchcraft Secrets"" will show you in detail,

how you can cast powerful spells, to make your wildest dreams come true.



http://screenslates.com/t/c/45494/av/cz108934.html



It's NOT your fault that your spells and rituals

aren't turning out like you want... YET.



The truth is... you've been misled by self-proclaimed

powerful wizards and witches... and the truth is that 

99% of these 'professionals' are DEAD WRONG!



In fact, a lot of what they say will actually diminish your powers.



They don't want you to know the right way to 

cast spells because if you did, you'd never need

them again and they would lose their power!



You cannot invent 'new' spells like you 

cannot invent a new tree. Everything is old. But

not everything is known in the right way.

http://screenslates.com/t/c/45494/av/cz108934.html



As you know, many witches and wizards are FURIOUS about this. Why?



Because it reveals the true forgotten secrets of

witchcraft. Secrets more powerful than what they 

can do through their very expensive services... 



Soon, everybody will be able to do this at home,

more effectively, cheaper and faster....



You've seen some ridiculous prices on the internet for

getting a spell done. It's obvious they are 

getting rich off of normal people and their problems... 



Once you know their secrets, you wonÃ­t need to give them your money!



I've personally tested this information, and some of the

old forgotten stuff is mind blowing: it's accurate, effective

and quite easy to do.

executive summary :
? cpuc direct access vote
cpuc
link to ? live webcast of cpuc meeting 10 : 00 am - @ : pm sept . 20 th
the sun may be setting on californians ' right to customer choice as the cpuc debates the fate of direct access today . we estimate that at this time , the cpuc commissioners will not be taking up the da issue and will instead delay the vote until after the legislature has convened the third special session , called by gov . davis last week . currently , both commissioners brown and wood appear unwilling to support da ; with president lynch being a swing vote .
concerning the retroactive suspension of direct access agreements of customers who have already elected alternate service providers , the current cpuc position appears to be that direct access contracts signed by september 20 th , 2001 will not be nullified . there is rumor that the cpuc may be reviewing several of the contracts signed within the past three to nine months . many commercial consumers now operating under da are highly pessimistic about the cpuc supporting da agreements that have been signed within the past three months . the business community is very conscience that the cpuc now bears the difficult task of weighing california businesses ' political and economic interests against the economic interests of california ' s residential power consumers .

OOP,"Hi,

I am trying to subclass the module Path::Class::Dir but without success.

If I create a simple program like the following, the subdir() method works 
fine, but it doesn't work if I create a subclass of the module and try to 
use that method.

use Path::Class::Dir;

my $dir = Path::Class::Dir->new('c:/windows/temp');
my $subdir = $dir->subdir(""perl"");
print ""$dir\n$subdir"";

This prints:
C:\windows\temp
C:\windows\temp\perl

But the following program prints the same dir for both the dir and the 
subdir:

use MyDir;
my $dir = MyDir->new('c:/windows/temp');
$dir->process;

#and the module:

package MyDir;

use base 'Path::Class::Dir';

sub new {
my $class = shift;
$class = ref($class) || $class;
my $path = shift;
my $self = $class->SUPER::new($path);
return bless $self, $class;
}

sub process {
my $self = shift;
my $subdir = $self->subdir(""perl"");
print ""$self\n$subdir"";
}

1;

This prints:
C:\windows\temp
C:\windows\temp

And I have seen that the new() method is called twice.

Please tell me what am I doing wrong.
Is Path::Class::Dir specially made for not beeing able to subclass it?

Thanks.

subject : var numbers for the 26 th
hi andreas ,
i have run the var model for the 26 th july and have attached a zip file of
the results :
the total var is $ 4 , 170 , 653 and the cu position is $ 1 , 852 , 876 .
i have had trouble getting hold of you so i thought i would summarised what i
wanted to talk about ( also i thought
i would give your ears a rest ! )
basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday ( we briefly
discussed it earlier ) .
the fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a
5 day period of adjustment to calculate
the risk ( in this case it is called capital at risk ) . the var calculation for
our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor
will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt ( 5 ) or 2 . 24 .
since :
old risk factor ( % ) = 1 . 65 * ( std of the price movement ) = 3 . 99 %
new daily risk factor = 3 . 99 / 2 . 24 = 1 . 78 % which actually equates to std
of approx 1 . 1 % a day .
i am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we
are showing for cu is approx 19 % which equates to approx 1 . 2 % daily .
using this new risk factor for the daily var the cu positions would give a
var ( for the 19 th ) of approx $ 2 m which is less that the
figure we estimated ( $ 3 , 100 , 568 ) .
the other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term
structure of the price curve / vol curve and position
curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means
that it is difficult to compare the numbers .
i hope that this helps to explain our number .
hopefully we can talk tomorrow ,
cheers

LDB base DN semantics,"Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

In the naming_fsmo module, we do a base search for
cn=3Dpartitions,cn=3Dconfiguration,dc=3D.....

This often fails before the DB is fully set up, so the code there allows
for 0 returned values, and continues.

However, when Samba4 is backed against LDAP, the error return is
different - NO_SUCH_OBJECT, as the base DN does not exist.  Shouldn't
LDB's tdb backend also return this?

I had to use this patch to allow naming_fsmo to cope with both cases:

forward obligations report issues,"bill -
following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report . as i understand , dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager , which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run ( forward obs included ) , but in the meantime these are the problems we ' ve seen . thanks so much for your help on this !
1 . report not reading two identical strips - when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours , same volume , same price and same counterparty ( using the same deal number ) , the report only reads one strip . for example , on 8 / 6 / 01 , deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for 50 mw he 7 - 12 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for he 13 - 22 . the report read all 50 mw he 7 - 12 , but only 25 mw he 13 - 22 . i zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw .
another example , on 8 / 4 / 01 , deal 718205 is a purchase from ees he 21 - 22 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each . again , the report read only one of these , and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours .
due to the nature of real time deal entry - high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling - it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price . so i ' m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms . please let me know if this is feasible .
2 . report not reading sales at the bc border - this is a new one that cropped up this morning . we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar , wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there . for some reason , although all three deals ( 724366 / 724368 / 724367 ) appear in deal entry and scheduling , the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report . after looking into this , i ' ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report . i ' m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border , although i don ' t recall seeing this problem before .
again , please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed . i look forward to our next conference call . . . .
thanks ,
kate symes

Just 'zip' the corresponding directory and copy the zip
file to your ""unix like"" environment.

I assume the only things this does not contain
would be the
	- registry entries (which used to be optional anyway;
			    I'm not sure if that's still true)     
	- desktop  links     to R
	- startup menu links to R

but the last two can easily be recreated after people copy the
zip file and unpack it in ""their windows enviroment"" -- 
which I assume is the purpose of the whole procedure..

{Please reply to R-help; not me, I am *the"" windows-non-expert ..}

re :,"the objective seems to have gotten alittle lost here .
we want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on friday ( although i take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here ) . bear in mind umbrella had agreed to these terms and mark m and lance were to run them passed top gun . presuming they did , seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actualy be ( lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen umbrella ' s term sheet last week ) .
the covering memo should be explicit in asking the ee to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms , they would sign them . the wording needs to be tight and regardless of it ' s enforceability make above clear . in other words let ' s make it look as binding as we can .
if we really can ' t do above let ' s say so and we can look at plan b . john , it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa jan 10 . however let ' s wait and see if we can get one more draft done for weds .

subject : csfb independent power weekly - issue # 31
good morning ,
attached , please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly .
>
summary :
1 . ipps fall 5 . 1 % last week our ipp composite fell 5 . 1 % , outperforming the
nasdaq ( - 8 . 1 % ) , but lagging behind the s and , 2 . extend floating caps to other western
states .
3 . minimal impact on ipps we believe the expansion of the ferc ' s current
market mitigation plan will have an immaterial impact on the independent
power producers with california exposure - aes , cpn , mir , nrg , and rri . our
reasons are as follows : 1 ) the bulk of their capacity is sold forward ; 2 .
the ferc ' s methodology is benign ; and , 3 ) valuations already reflect
political uncertainty and normalized power prices .
4 . nrg hosts conference call on friday ( 6 / 15 ) , nrg hosted a conference call
to address investor concerns surrounding near - term equity needs , pending
acquisitions and recent regulatory developments . on the call management
noted that : 1 ) barring a major acquisition , it will not issue equity in the
near - term ; 2 ) nrg ' s pending acquisition of 1 , 767 mw of generation capacity
from conectiv should close by june 30 ; and , 3 ) expansion of the ferc ' s
western market mitigation measures should not impact nrg ' s performance .
also on the call , management reaffirmed its previous 2001 eps guidance of
$ 1 . 35 . . trading at 13 . 2 times our 2002 estimate versus a group average of
16 . 1 times , nrg represents the best relative value in the ipp group . we
believe this discount is unwarranted and reiterate our buy rating and $ 37
price target .
5 . review of orn analyst conference on tuesday ( 6 / 12 ) , orion power hosted
its first major investor conference in baltimore , maryland . the meeting
featured presentations from 10 senior managers . we do not believe investors
were previously aware of the full breadth and depth of the management team .
while no major announcements were made , the meeting served to confirm that
orn is on track to achieve its strategic and growth objectives .
6 . coverage of geg initiated with a buy rating on june 11 , 2001 csfb
initiated on global power equipment group ( geg ) with a buy rating and a
twelve - month price target of $ 42 . we co - cover geg with john mcginty - - csfb ' s
machinery analyst .

Or you could simply do:

$^T = time;

Before you do the file test which will put the current time into $^T which is
what -M uses to calculate the file time:

$ perl -le'
    $file = shift;
    print -M $file;
    $^T = time() - 86400;
    print -M $file;

subject : cats litigation
disappointingly , the house of lords ruled 5 - 0 against enron in the cats litigation today . this will mean that we will repay to the cats parties approximately $ 150 million plus interest and court costs , putting the final figure at an estimated $ 155 - 160 million . we expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so ; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days . the written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says . the opinion seeks to conclude "" what rational businessmen could have intended "" rather than applying the provisions of the contract .
for example , lord hoffman ( author of the primary opinion ) makes it clear that the "" retrospective consequences "" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made ( and would therefore need to be refunded ) are unacceptable . his view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow j - block gas during the period of the t - 6 leak , we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract . furthermore , he says that the commencement date notice sent by the cats parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective .
as far as the price reduction formula in clause 7 . 5 , lord hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until tgtl had tied in the j - block field . the contract makes no reference to this requirement . hoffman ' s view is that it is only upon tie - in that the cats parties ' obligation to provide the transportation service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie - in is complete . this statement is in stark contrast with hoffman ' s earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the commencement date notice the cats parties have an absolute obligation to provide the transportation service .
equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue . as you may recall , restitution was the primary issue upon which the cats parties obtained leave to appeal , and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing . reimbursement of these costs should have been a given .
although i have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister , our other counsel have assessed the opinion as "" appalling "" and "" pathetic , "" and describe the situation as one where enron has been "" stitched up "" . unfortunately , given that this is the court of last resort in this country ( except of course the court of human rights ) , there is not an avenue for recourse .
in conclusion may i say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the house of lords , i very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years . the case has been a roller coaster ride ; i hope our earlier victory in the court of appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right .
please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail , or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion . my telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582 . many thanks .",0

joao neves,"dear vince :
?
i am in a somewhat delicate position . one of the people in the group here
has asked me to introduce him to you . ? as an el paso vice president , i
should not have agreed to do this , and frankly , the guy should not have
asked . ? but he is clearly very unhappy at el paso , so , as a human being , i
felt it was appropriate . also , because this guy would have contacted you
anyway , with or without my introduction , as a professional courtesy , i would
like you to benefit from my experience with this fellow .
?
the guy ' s name is joao neves ( portugese ) . ? i think he is reasonably bright
and seems to have a quite deep understanding of general finance and
financial mathematics . he is a manager and feels very frustrated because he
had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority . instead the group ' s
m . d . brought in two price - waterhouse - coopers consultants as v . p ' s to run the
structuring and quant sides of the group . in this respect , i can understand
his unhappiness . unfortunately for him , however , i also think it is in his
nature to whine . ? i have observed him to bad mouth lots of people starting
with the it guys ( ok , that ' s perhaps not much an indictment ! ) all the way to
dismissing broadie & glasserman ' s or eduardo schwartz ' works as shoddy or
shallow . ? he does not seem to suffer well people he considers fools . ? caveat
emptor , therefore ! having said all this , i do want to emphasize that he is a
bright guy , is very pleasant with me , and , perhaps given the appropriate
environment and supervision , might be quite productive . ? but don ' t take my
word for it . talk to him , and see what you think . ? obviously , i would ask
that you keep these comments in confidence . i have given you an honest
assessment - - brutally so .
?
' nuff said ! i have fulfilled my moral obligations both to joao and to you .
?

Often, similar computer model share some components (read the specs).
But, as mentioned by Michael, one should never assume that ""similar
component"" behave the same way nor they are compatible... (don't

Re: Mails should not go in SPAM Box,"Sounds like a combination of both.

If your mail server is set up to allow internal sites to pass through
with no checks, then you should be OK

If you mail server checks everything, white list your internal domain

If your mail server is not the culprit, check your email program and
white-list things there as well.

But the kicker is you first need to make sure your headers are properly
formatted.  Check the header of the email in your Junk/Spam folder and
see why it got put there in the first place.  With spam-assassin running
on your mail server, it should put the score in the header.

You have some digging to do to figure out why, but the first spot should
be local machine, then server, then mail message.  Bad formatted headers
will do more harm then good, so getting things correct there might help
with scores on the other end.

HTH,
Wolf

Re: [R] Factor analysis,"I wrote some rough functions for principal factor,
principal-components factor, and  iterated principal factor analysis.
I think they are workable, the same results as stata can be retained.

In addition, functions for gls and uls factor analysis is in progress,
which is based on the algorithms of SPSS. I get the same results by
the gls factor analysis, and quite similiar result by the uls factor
analysis.

[R] fisher information matrix,"Hi All,

a colleague wants to calculate the Fisher information matrix for a model he 
wrote (not in R). He can easily get the neg-log-likelihood and the best fit 
parameters at the minimum. He can also get negLLs for other parameter values too.

Given these data, is there a way in R to calculate the Fisher information matrix?

Best,

transportation contracts this week . dynegy executed 35 , 000 mmbtu / d for
calendar year 2003 from san juan to the california border and calpine signed
up for 14 , 000 mmbtu / d under similar terms . in addition , dynegy executed two
short term index - to - index contracts ; one month , 13 , 500 mmbtu / d for november
2001 , and 21 , 500 mmbtu / d for november - december 2002 . both short term
deals are from san juan to california . hedges have been established on all
the contracts to minimize tw ' s price exposure to the market indexes .
in addition , bp / amoco purchased two packages of space at max rates on the
ignacio to blanco route . they purchased 55 , 000 mmbtu / d for calendar 2002 and
20 , 000 mmbtu / d for 2003 . with the exception of a small package of permian
to cal . border in november 2001 , all available firm transportation flowing
west has now been soldout on tw through the end of 2003 .
exxon / nalco enerflow - attended the exxon presentation to operations this
week on the proposed project to inject a drag reducing agent into several
segments along tw ' s system . potential benefits include increasing our
westward volume capacity by 5 % , enhanced compressor efficiencies , and
increased corrosion protection . however , we are still waiting on the final
results of the nng cunningham test segment . due to contamination issues on
the mainline , we will likely begin by coating the 96 miles of san juan
lateral pipe sometime before the second quarter .
transcolorado - tc is evaluating outsourcing its entire back office

operations meeting in long beach this week to discuss the potential of
injecting natural gas liquids into tw ' s system to increase the btu content of
gas going into california . this project has numerous logistic details to be
worked not the least of which is where to site the injection point either
upstream or downstream of needles . other issues include railroad siding , ngl
storage tanks , and possible contamination of downstream facilities . a
follow - up meeting is planned for the end of january .
enron online - tw marketing representatives attended enron online training
this week as we prepare to roll out capacity deals on the east end of tw ' s

This is documented somewhere already.  Pugs does not implement the  
spec as documented, though.

File tests are supposed to return something which:
- behaves as a Bool
- stringifies as a filename
- numifies as a file size or as a time, if appropriate
- propagates a stat object (obviating perl5's magic _)

Current Pugs only does the first three, sort of:  the size and time  
operators return numeric, the others string, all behave appropriately  
if used as booleans.  This means you mostly get the expected results  
for chained tests, at the price of every operator doing its own stat().

My impression is that junction types aren't really ""there"" yet, so  
this is the best that can currently be done.

R you sure that you have correctly specified the column and data frame
names in the call to randomForest()?

Be sure to check for typos, including capitalization.

You can use:

  ls()

to check for the current objects in your working environment and you can
then use:

  str(YourDataFrame)

or 

  names(YourDataFrame)

to display information about the detailed structure and/or column names,
respectively, in the data frame that you created from the imported data.

re : energy derivatives,"hi vince ,
hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next
week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out
some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! )
to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of
the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter ?
i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style .
many thanks and best regards .
chris .
2 overview of this book
this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book .
in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean
reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .
chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and
trade .
chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves . what we do in this chapter
chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors
and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or
average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .
chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form
solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps .
chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is
developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style
options .
chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a
multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are
developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo
schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of american style options .
chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .
in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also
discussed .
chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after
discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs
( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,
delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we
look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market
variables .
finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .",0

appropriate transactions,"louise ,
i am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of pluto / megs to duke energy field services as well as the sale of the napoleonville land to texas brine . in addition , i am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in dow wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from dow .
are there any types of transactions that would be "" inappropriate "" to close ? for example , if we do an outsourcing deal for three years , how do we know that dynegy will honor the contract ?

Word of the Day for Wednesday, June 13, 2007

contravene \kon-truh-VEEN\, transitive verb:

1. To act or be counter to; to violate.
2. To oppose in argument; to contradict.

 In 1620 most people considered the likelihood of reversing the
 seasons inside a building impossible, and many deemed it
 sacrilege, an attempt to contravene the natural order, to twist
 the configuration of the world established by God. 
 -- Tom Shachtman, Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold Anorexics, for example, clearly contravene our evolutionary
 dictate to eat. 
 -- Jerry A. Coyne, ""Of Vice and Men"", The New Republic, April 3,
 2000 -------------------------------------------------------------------

Contravene comes from Late Latin contravenire, ""to oppose,"" from
Latin contra-, ""against"" + venire, ""to come.""

the commission issued an order today rejecting transwestern ' s filing to purchase and sell options for firm transportation capacity . the commission found that transwestern has not met its burden of proof that its proposal will overcome the adverse consequences identified by the parties to this proceeding . specifically , the concerns raised by the protestors included : the reservation of future capacity without a concomitant payment of reservation charges , which precludes other shippers that place a higher value on the capacity from acquiring the capacity ; the use of the program for speculative purposes ; and the absence of a recourse options rate to provide protection to shippers as required under the commission ' s negotiated rate authority . i ' m faxing the order . i presume we want to seek rehearing ? maria",0

is the following all right to send to the group ?
* * * * * * * *
good morning all :
the question has arisen as to whether enron has "" personal days "" , that ,
you can take in case of repair problems at home ; car problems ; sick spouse ,
sick child , etc .
i checked with hr and the policy manual and the answer is "" no "" , but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor . i talked this over
with vince and he has decided that the research group will be allowed
two ( 2 ) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day , discretionary day , or leave of absence .
if you have advance notice ( such as an air conditioner repair scheduled ) ,
please let me know when you are going to take these days . if an
emergency arises with no notice , please call in and let me know that you
are taking a personal day . it will be coded on your time sheet .
these two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of , "" funeral
leave "" , "" family leave "" , or "" civic duty leave "" . they are just a way of being
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise .
these should be very beneficial and i am sure very much appreciated by
all of us .
if you have any questions , please call me .

pieza del mes de julio / 2005,"visita en la casa de la ciudad , la pieza del mes  la
cual estaremos renovando mensualmente con diversas piezas .
ahora tenemos dentro de este espacio una acuarela del pintor paisajista august lohr , realizada en el año de 1910 , donde el autor expone una vista de uno de los edificios del complejo arquitectónico de la zona arqueológica de mitla , oaxaca . te invitamos a que lo conozcas , en la sala del foto piso ( planta alta ) ,
de martes a domingo de 9 a 20 hrs .
august lohr nació en hallein ( austria ) . fue uno de los participantes de la creación de los más espectaculares panoramas de su época al igual que josef krieger , haciéndose de prestigio como pintor
paisajista de salzburgo en los años 80  s y 90  s del siglo xix , cuando la  panoramía  se extendía especialmente .
en 1890 lohr viajó a méxico , para pasar ahí los 30 años del resto de su vida . aunque el negocio de los panoramas todavía floreció hasta finales del siglo xix , lohr se dirigió otra vez a su verdadera ocupación : la pintura de paisajes ,  la belleza de las montañas mexicanas , la riqueza de colores del paisaje tropical , le daban a su mano maestra una abundancia de trabajo y de su taller salio un gran cantidad de hermosos cuadros para los aficionados al arte en méxico 

saguaro : csfb is selling mission ' s 50 % interest in saguaro . we have agreed to piggyback on the investment bank ' s process in order to sell our 15 % interest . binding bids are due june 8 - expect q 3 close .

dwr : waiting on pro - forma financials and new agreement between dwr and puc that better secures credit . bonds just got approved - 90 day wait . negotiating eei for short term deals as well . dwr bid has $ 80 mm over mid , but i appear to be only one that thinks we should do a term deal with dwr . i will stay on top of this - these guys are the new big player in the market .
roseville : rac has recommended approval and we are circulating for signature . payment of $ 6 mm to georgia pacific for erc ' s due next week . balance of $ 43 mm to be spent over next 18 months . calpine and allegheny want to buy in - its a little early , but we might explore that in q 4 or ql 02 .
roseville prepay : someone else ( calpine or duke ) was more aggressive on the np - 15 term commodity offer so we are out - our best offer was mids + $ 5 ; someone else offfered at our mids . we are trying to see if we can partrner with the winner since our bid for cash may be higher .

time reporting for non - exempt employees - policy,"hi louise ,
i was cleaning out my e - mails since we ' re migrating over to outlook from lotus notes and came across the following . . . it reminded me of a certain highly paid admin . . . it was good to see you on sat , best of luck for the remaining of the week !
avril
with the consolidation of several units under enron net works , we would like to remind everyone of the time reporting policy for non - exempt employees to ensure that we have a consistent and fair application of the policy :
employees are expected to begin work promptly at their regularly scheduled starting time and manage their work time productively . each full - time employee is expected to work a minimum of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week . non - exempt employees are to receive pay for overtime hours worked consistent with company policy and law . supervisors should ensure that overtime is approved in advance and properly reported for non - exempt workers . supervisors should also be notified in a timely fashion in the event a non - exempt employee will be out ill , etc . it would also be helpful if the non - exempt employee contacted their administrative back - up to ensure adequate departmental coverage .
as a general rule , non - exempt employees should not be working at home to "" make - up "" time missed at work during the week , nor should they be accumulating overtime hours by working at home . all non - exempt employees should document time missed from work as either sick time , vacation time or personal time with or without pay . please note that all time being documented as personal time with pay requires supervisor approval . personal time with pay should be used in only limited circumstances . any employee documenting more than 16 hours of personal time in a calendar year , will require prior approval from the division vp and the vp of human resources to ensure policy compliance .
the designation , "" family time with pay "" is to be used in instances of time off for the death of an immediate family member , or as otherwise indicated by policy . hours missed during the day for personal appointments , etc . may be made up within the same week and should be documented accordingly on the timesheets .
all assistant timesheets should be approved by the administrative coordinator or lead in the group and should be signed each pay period by the employee and the immediate supervisor . if there is no lead in the group , then the signed timesheets should be forwarded each pay period to either executive assistant in the office of the chairman .
thank you for your adherence to this policy .",0

debt trading losses,"we have discovered two positions in the debt trading book which were not
being marked to market . the current mark of the 2 positions results in
approximately $ 4 . 7 million loss . the details are in :
the primary control issues are :
? trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had
not moved over the term of the transactions ( ql ' 00 - nov 15 th )
the losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by
operations . the trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will
implement the steps agreed with operations to ensure that we have a robust

So I see 'p.exe' in the Words and Wireshark doesn't decode those bytes
so it looks like there's just garbage at the end. Meaning the WordCount
and the NetBIOS header payload size are incorrect (too large).

Re: three hds? is this possible?,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

You can have up to 4 ide devices in your system without needing an
additional i/o card. So yes, you could have 1 cd-rom drive, and 3 hard
drives, or any combination there of. You need to make sure that all
your devices are jumpered properly, and that the bios is set up to
recognize your drives correctly.

Seriously, if you find yourself running out of room a good part of the
time, consider getting a bigger drive, that's what I ended up having
to do. I do seem to recall though, that you have an older system
running win98. If that's the case, then your bios might not be able to
fully recognize the capacity on today's drives, depending on how old
your system is. This of course, might or might not be fixed by a newer
version of your bios, assuming the bios on your board is flashable,
and not an eprom.

BTW, I do recall this kind of stuff being discussed on here more then once,
so you might want to have a look through the list archives.

if you have original MS-whatever installed, compare what happens when 
running with the shipped OS. Also, check there what the pm utils knows
about the fan.

depends, if the BIOS was designed to offer standard hooks to the OS; if it 
was designed to talk to a proprietary pm util only, you're out of luck - or
in the need to disassemble and dig into the code of such util.

Re: alsa questions?,"Amanda,

This sounds like a PCI error of some sort, it appears to probe
the PCI bus and and cannot find the card. The message shows
it assigned an interrupt (IRQ 9) but then says cannot find the 
slot  for index 0 (range 0-0), that could also be related to the 
ACPI which among other things dynamically assigns the 
interrupts. Maybe it is conflicting with the other sound card
or another PCI device. A few things that you could check:

If you do lspci command does it show both sound cards?

Have you tried getting each sound card working separately 
before trying to get them both working at the same time?

In the BIOS settings there is configuration for PCI slots,
you may be able to do manual setting the PCI slots that 
have the cards installed rather choosing auto.

Two other possible BIOS settings you could try are 
turning of the ""PnP Aware OS"" setting and turning off
the ACPI setting. If you try these try them one at a time
to see if they make any difference.

It would be worthwhile to try to find out what the error
code -12 means on the following error message
EMU10K1X: probe of 0000:00:0f.0 failed with error -12

Perhaps looking at the alsaconf source code would help
determine what triggers the -12 error and what it means,
depends on if the code is well documented.

BTW I love your email signature, continuing on with the
Williamson quote ... There is nothing enlightened about 
shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around 
you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were 
born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. 
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let 
our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people 
permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our 
own fear, our presence automatically liberates others ...

Thanks Brian and Marc for this solution. I simplified my example too
much, as in reality there are additional arguments after '...', but with
a minor change to the solution you provided I got it working.

Are there any particular situations (other than the one you show) that
you are aware of when this might happen? I will put a Warning section in
the Rd page for my function explaining that it might not name the
components correctly, so any further examples of where this might not
work could be helpful in writing that.

All the best,

hi varou ,
a depressed person may also dwell on negative thoughts , focus on unpleasant experiences , describe themselves as a failure , report that things are hopeless , and feel as though they are a burden to others . the changes in mood brought on by depression frequently result in feelings of sadness , irritability , anger , emptiness , and / or anxiety . there are also some types of depression , including bipolar disorder , in which depressive episodes alternate with manic or hypomanic episodes which may include feelings of agitation and euphoria . a severe or long - term depressive episode can substantially erode self - esteem and may result in thoughts of death and suicide .

subject : press release from kyle field
college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . "" the end
zones were confusing , "" says slocum . "" i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . ""
oklahoma officials are calling this "" outrageous "" . "" they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , "" replies ou coach
bob stoops . "" if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . ""
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . "" we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , "" says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . "" they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , ""
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

to as impotence, is the inability for a sexually active male to obtain
and sustain an erection for sexual purposes. In the past, this has been
very embarrassing for men, and a source of anxiety for their partners,

Gateway MT6451,"Hi all!
I`m a new happy owner of a gateway laptop model MT6451 and as a linux
lover I decided to
leave windows vista and put the new version of debian (4.0 ETCH).

I would like to know if someone has experiencing this same situation, of
if there is someone who knows how i can fix my problem.

Another information about the soundcard: alsaconf detects and installs a
device recognized by linux as hda-intel ATI Technologies Inc SB450 HDA
Audio (rev 01)  and finish without errors, and with alsamix i checked
the channels and those are not mute but i still with no sound...

thanks for the help!

while you bait is at work !,"joke of the day
the american dairy association was so successful with its "" got milk ? "" campaign , that it was decided to extend the ads to mexico . unfortunately , the spanish translation was "" are you lactating ? ""
electrolux , a scandinavian vacuum manufacturer , used this ad in the u . s . : "" nothing sucks like an electrolux . ""
colgate introduced a toothpaste called "" cue "" in france , but it turned out to be the same name as a well - known porno magazine . when braniff translated a slogan touting its upholstery , "" fly in leather , "" it came out in spanish as "" fly naked . "" coors put its slogan , "" turn it loose , "" into spanish , where it was read as "" suffer from diarrhea . ""
chicken magnate frank perdue ' s line , "" it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken , "" sounds much more interesting in spanish : "" it takes a sexually stimulated man to make a chicken affectionate . "" bacardi concocted a fruity drink with the name "" pavian "" to suggest french chic . . . but "" pavian "" means "" baboon "" in german .
a hair products company , clairol , introduced the "" mist stick "" , a curling iron , into germany only to find out that mist is slang for manure . not too many people had use for the manure stick . when kentucky fried chicken entered the chinese market , to their horror they discovered that their slogan "" finger lickin ' good "" came out as "" eat your fingers off ""
when vicks first introduce its cough drops on the german market , they were chagrined to learn that the german pronunciation of "" v "" is f - which in german is the guttural equivalent of "" sexual penetration . "" parker pens translated the slogan for its ink , "" avoid embarrassment - use quink "" into spanish as "" evite embarazos - use quink "" . . . which also means , "" avoid pregnancy - use quink . "" when pepsi started marketing its products in china a few years back , they translated their slogan , "" pepsi brings you back to life "" pretty literally . the slogan in chinese really meant , "" pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave . "" in italy , a campaign for "" schweppes tonic water "" translated the name into the much less thirst quenching "" schweppes toilet water . ""
chinese translation proved difficult for coke , which took two tries to get it right . they first tried ke - kou - ke - la because when pronounced it sounded roughly like coca - cola . it wasn ' t until after thousands of signs had been printed that they discovered that the phrase means "" bite the wax tadpole "" or "" female horse stuffed with wax , "" depending on the dialect . second time around things worked out much better . after researching 40 , 000 chinese characters , coke came up with "" ko - kou - ko - le "" which translates roughly to the much more appropriate "" happiness in the mouth . "" not to be outdone , puffs tissues tried later to introduce its product , only to learn that "" puff "" in german is a colloquial term for a whorehouse . the english weren ' t too fond of the name either , as it ' s a highly derogatory term for a non - heterosexual .
the chevy nova never sold well in spanish speaking countries . "" no va "" means "" it doesn ' t go "" in spanish . ford introduced the pinto in brazil . after watching sales go nowhere , the company learned that "" pinto "" is brazilian slang for "" tiny male genitals . "" ford pried the nameplates off all of the cars and substituted them with "" corcel "" which means horse . when gerber first started selling baby food in africa , they used the same packaging as here in the usa - with the cute baby on the label . later they found out that in africa companies routinely put pictures on the label of what ' s inside since most people can ' t read . in the french part of canada , hunt - wesson introduced its "" big john "" products as "" gros jos . "" it later found out that the phrase is slang for "" big breasts . ""

"[Ip-health] Second-line drugs only hope for many 12,000 resistant to first-line Aids drugs","Second-line drugs only hope for many 12,000 resistant
to first-line Aids drugs

APIRADEE TREERUTKUARKUL, Bangkok Post, 14 May 07

It's six o'clock in the morning and Supan Pankaew is
ready to go to the provincial hospital, about 20km
from her farmhouse in Si Sa Ket's Wang Hin district.
Once a month, the 39-year-old widow has to drive her
old motorbike to the hospital, where she has to wait
in a long queue to meet a doctor and receive anti-Aids
drugs.


''No one except people living with HIV/Aids knows how
hard it is to get access to medical treatment, whether
first-line or second-line drugs,'' said Pan, as she is
known to her family.


Her recent viral load test and CD4 count, which are
used to measure the level of HIV in the blood to
determine the stage of the disease, showed that her
condition has worsened and she needs to take
anti-retroviral medicine.


She contracted HIV/Aids from her husband nine years
ago. She is resistant to first-line drugs such as
GPO-VIR and the second-line drug Kaletra seems to be
the only hope for her.


Fortunately, last March she was listed as eligible to
receive Kaletra free of charge via the healthcare
scheme for employees of private firms supervised by
the Social Security Office.


Despite getting diarrhoea as a side-effect from the
new medication, she feels it is still better than
suffering from limp legs and arms, a side-effect of
GPO-VIR, which her body began to resist.


Pan is among a small group of 500 HIV-positive people
who can obtain the free Kaletra under the National
Access to Anti-retroviral Programme for People Living
with HIV/Aids.


The majority of the approximately 12,000 infected
people who have developed resistance to first-line
anti-retroviral treatment do not have such
opportunities.


HIV-positive people dependent on first-line medication
usually find themselves resistant to the drugs within
a few years.


''The state cannot afford the cost of treatment for
all people living with HIV/Aids who are resistant to
drugs as long as the prices of second-line drugs are
still too high,'' said Sombat Tanprasertsuk, director
of the Aids, Tuberculosis and Sexually-Transmitted
Diseases Bureau.


The market price of imported Kaletra is currently
about $2,200 (73,000 baht) per person per year.


However, the drug producer, Abbott Laboratories, has
offered to cut the price of Kaletra to $1,000 (32,500
baht) per patient per year if the government revokes
its compulsory licensing to bypass the drug's patent.


But the government said it would not make any decision
until its stockpile of Kaletra runs out, probably in
August.


Dr Sombat believes compulsory licensing, which
empowers the government to manufacture or import
generic versions of medicine, will help many more
people living with HIV/Aids who have developed
resistance to drugs prolong their lives.


The government spent about 3.8 billion baht in the
last fiscal year on HIV/Aids treatment for half a
million people living with the disease.


The compulsory licences issued on Jan 29 covered three
drugs used for treating Aids and heart disease _
Efavirenz, Kaletra and Plavix.


To seek more options in expanding access to such
drugs, Public Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla went
to New York last week to sign an agreement with the
Clinton Foundation to buy a generic version of Aluvia,
an improved version of Kaletra, from the Indian
generic drug maker Matrix Laboratories for $695 per
person per year.


However, the government's efforts to acquire cheap
generic drugs for Aids patients in the country has
upset pharmaceutical giants and is believed to have
led to Thailand's downgrading in the US government's
Priority Watch List of countries with low protection
of intellectual property rights.


A US lobby group, reportedly supported by drug firms
affected by the compulsory licensing, has also
launched an advertising campaign against the policy
and the locally-made drug GPO-VIR.


Many Thai patients, including Pan, see this as the
company's way of taking revenge for the government's
decision to override the patents on the three drugs.


''What they are doing is cold-blooded. They know that
millions of people will die because they can't afford
expensive drugs. But these firms care more about
profits than anything else,'' she said.

Thanks for the help, Deepayan.  Yes, I guess what I am looking for is
the actual numerical value for aspect.ratio that is used when aspect =
""fill"".  My device is a pdf and I don't resize it.  Could I execute the
whole plot, including printing it, while saving the aspect.ratio that
was used, then create the plot again?

Re: gentoo dropping speakup support,"I have to strongly disagree here as relates to bootable messages.
Speakup makes linux the *only* os where blind users can see the boot  
up as it happens.  Even dos can't do that, and I have more than once  
managed to fix a machine with linux because of the speakup capability  
to speak *all* bootup messages.  Dumping them to a logfile, booting  
with a live cd, then reading the log may work for users who are  
advanced enough to figure it out, (or are lucky enough to have simple  
enough configurations this can be done) but by doing so, you're  
basically saying that those who want to troubleshoot their own boxes  
w/o sighted assistance are sol.
And, if the hd is bad, then your logging isn't going to work anyhow.   
Not to mention, this isn't a process that can be done w/o sighted  
assistance.
While I'm more of a slackware user than anything else, having speakup  
work out of the box is something I've enjoyed almost since speakup  
was released, and I for one would be extremely sorry (not to mention  
irritated at the lack of access it would mean) to have it removed  
into user space.  There's already programs for user space access  
(yasr anyone) and while those work for normal usage, they aren't  
usable for troubleshooting and/or fixing a broken machine.  I've been  
doing my own technical support since 1990 (or thereabouts) and having  
this capability now removed would be the equivalent of moving to  
vista before any screen readers were specifically targeted to it.   
Sure, you could use the system, but you're not going to get anywhere  
near the full use out of your system you'd otherwise get.

I don't have a 64-bit machine, so can't help fix this problem, nor  
are my C skills up to the task (likely) but I'd strongly urge those  
with the capability, to *not* abandon speakup working as it does now.
I will of course help where I can, but yanking it entirely out of the  
boot sequence is just asking for additional problems.
Don't do it.

[R] EWMA in fMultivar,"Hello, I would like to use the function EWMA() in the fMultivar Package and I
have a series of data x, which is the returns series. Basically, I would
like to get the variance estimation using EWMA.

I am trying something like EWMA(x, lambda) and I have a couple of questions:

 
Should x be the returns series or price series in my case?

When I get the result, there are the same numbers of data points as in the
returns series. I was expecting there would be one less data points than the
original data series, or are they one period lagged data?

Could anyone give me some advice? Many thanks

Re: Regarding files,"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

     Since you are having the whole file in an array.
    1. Keep an index to specify the current line read
    2. Once you found the desired string, you have the index also. So 
you can
        decrement the index and get the lines.

$inex = 0;
foreach $line (@lines) {
$index++;
if($line =~ m/ CHANNEL_INFO_T/)
{
       $prevLine1 = @lines[$index-1];
        $prevLine2 = @lines[$index-2];
}
 # do something with $line
}



Hope this helps

1 . ipps fall 1 . 9 % last week our ipp composite fell 1 . 9 % , underperforming
both the nasdaq ( + 4 . 0 % ) and the s 2 . ) the ferc settlement conference

favorable to generators ; 3 . ) on july 12 , the us bankruptcy court approved
calpine ' s settlement with pg and , 4 . ) on july 10 , nrg energy announced it
would acquire a 2 , 255 mw portfolio from indeck .
3 . latin america pressuring aes earnings the likelihood of downside to our
2001 eps estimate for aes . corp . of $ 1 . 89 has increased materially . we
believe the ongoing currency weakness combined with power rationing have the
potential to negatively impact 2001 eps by $ 0 . 25 - $ 0 . 30 versus prior
expectations - on a stand - alone basis . while management indicated in mid - may
that it could offset weakness in brazil , the currency has materially
depreciated since that time and shows no signs of improvement in the
near - term . aes ' s second quarter earnings conference call will take place on
july 26 . following the call , we will adjust our 2001 estimate accordingly ,
unless management indicates that it remains positioned to offset these items
through upside in other parts of its business .
4 . ferc alj issues report on thursday ( 7 / 12 ) , curtis wagner , the
administrative law judge who presided over the recent settlement conference ,
issued a report presenting his findings and recommendations for next steps .
overall , the report was very much consistent with our expectations . while
wagner notes that some refunds are due from the generators , he argues that
the $ 8 . 9 billion demanded by the state of california "" cannot be
substantiated . "" we believe calpine and mirant offer the greatest downside
protection from this issue .
5 . csfb power generation supply chain conference on september 10 and 11 ,
csfb will host a power generation supply chain conference at the plaza hotel
in new york city . this event is designed to provide investors with a
wholistic perspective on all aspects of the sector - from coal and natural gas

Try comparing packet traces of 3.0.21c and 3.0.24.

yes, unfortunately this is not always predictive of actual windows

IIRC the default for ""msdfs root"" changed to ""yes"" around this time.  
We found that enabling this causes windows clients to do a lot more  
requests, with a corresponding drop in (netbench) performance.

when I run cardmgr though, the card is recognized and assigned to TTYS0. Do you
have any suggestions as to why this is and how I can get this card assigned a

Erectile dysfunction (ED), 


sometimes referred 
to as impotence, is the inability 


for a sexually active male to obtain 
and sustain an erection for sexual
 purposes. In the past, this has been

and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment


 options available 

until very recently.



Viagra

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .",0

This means that in some steps of the stepwise procedure, one of the 
functions for estimating the parameters or predicting (in this case lda 
or predict.lda)  generates an error. This typically happens if you 
cannot invert the covariance matrix in one of the intermediately tried 
models due to singularity (examples for such a case are collinear 
variables or an unluckily chosen partition of the data for 
cross-validation).

By default, it uses 10-fold cross-validation which can be changed to 
leave-one-out by specifying the argument
   fold = nrow(dataframe)

Yes, 10-fold cv is performed with randomly chosen partitions of the 
data. You can either run leave-one-out cv (which is rather time 
consuming) or use set.seed() in order to get reproducible results.

So, the Pointy-Haired Boss won't let you use any module that didn't
come with Perl?

Even if you can't use Parse::RecDescent in your final program, you can
still use it to get the job done. If something resembling Chas Owens's
solution works, you can turn a grammar into a module by the means
described under ""Precompiling parsers"". Then you can pull the Perl
code out of that module, and the PHB never has to know you didn't
write it yourself.

Log:
When processing a string, ensure we don't write one past
the terminating NULL if we've already processed the null
in iconv. Jerry, once I get confirmation from Thomas Bork
this needs to be in 3.0.25 final. Tests fine with valgrind
here.

dispatch within maharashtra,"jim ,
please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run
giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra . i have also sent
the presentation we made to you to wade . he is to get back on when would be
an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me .
vince , stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca ' s calender for friday ,
and we will make the complete pitch to her . it would be great if you too
could be present at the meeting . if it is possible , please do let me know .
on the attached slides , please note that :
the slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff , mseb liability for
the entire capacity payment is not considered .
the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra
when variable o & m costs , fixed o though in
some months ( jan ) it goes as high as $ 69 mm . hence , overall , mseb can pay
for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided , they are not paying
for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant .
in conclusion , therefore , mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a
seasonal basis . this means that the power remaining to be sold to other
states is the difference between that and 2184 mw .
however , since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally , it may mean
that we need to market seasonal products to other states , not long term
blocks .
these are our conclusions . we may continue to work some more on the fuel and
hedging side . if you have any more questions for me , please let me know ,
else for now there will not be any new henwood runs .
regards ,
sandeep .",0

i added palo verde to the group of deals imported , and ran a total of 37 lines into the path confirmation . the rest of the sheet was all bookouts , and so i marked them for routing only . i do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation . this will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for real time and settlements .
i would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up , as the lists can be long , and i have to make notes on what is wrong . also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time . we currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths . this would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet , instead of cleaning up afterwards .
routing functionality question : if we change a delivery point in scheduling ( bpa nw delivered gets moved and changed every day ) , do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point ? these types of deals route now , i would like to duplicate that existing functionality . i did get an error message on those lines , "" capability not supported : deal has multiple delivery points "" please see the attached sheet , there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86 , but it is all deals that are our bpa northwest delivered .
the routing speed is excellent . one second per line or less all the way in portland on local enpower ! the megawatts also appear to split properly between mis - matched deal amounts ! this is very encouraging . my palo data was corrupted , so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points .
my plan is to attack the alias stuff from a different angle . we are going to work with the team that sets the enpower "" short name "" to something that is workable . i would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that enpower short name .
in path confirmation
the early sorting looks good , things look very versatile and useable .
yesterday i identified several problems :
1 . the entire path needs to be shown in both counterparty paths . currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp .
2 . the alias list is not functioning properly . the enpower long name needs to be shown in the collapsed counterparty view , along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp .
3 . confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch , not pulling up each deal line by line .
today , i am finding the following :
1 . when a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view , the system blows away the schedule term and the delivery point . these fields have to be re - populated before saving can occur .
2 . i am not allowed to sort by global id , even though global ids are populated there . my idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section , no globals go in another section , and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers . ( just like the phys vs . non phys ) .
3 . pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes . this is to long to be practical in production for real time . i would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less .
4 . all paths are showing up as being cut ( cut checkbox checked ) , even though none have been cut yet .
5 . the grey on grey color scheme is not going to work , but that is a little thing . lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable . variations of the beige color are easier to read .
6 . the path cut button and dialog boxes i think are going to need alot of work . it looks like i will have to do all the enpower work first , and then populate the cut . this is a bit different than we discussed . my plan is to take this as far as i can , and then hand it over to bill williams iii and his group for final ' tweaking ' .
7 . i also cannot sort by tag number . we need that .
thank you all for your work on this , it is really looking good .
i have to schedule on monday , but will jump right back in when i am finished with daily tasks .

caiso notification : demand relief program settlement charge types,"this is a reminder that the summer 2001 iso demand relief program
charges are reflected on the june 30 statements and june invoices . as
announced previously this year , the iso has developed a summer 2001 demand
relief program ( drp ) . the program is designed to provide an additional
level of demand reduction on the iso system that can be implemented during a
stage 2 emergency in an effort to prevent involuntary load curtailments or
rotating blackouts associated with a stage 3 emergency .
similar to last years program , the same charge types are utilized
for capacity , charge type 7 and 117 , described in the first link below . two
new charge types , 3472 and 3482 , have been created for the energy payment
and allocation when contracted loads are called upon to curtail , described
in the second link below . although the program was initiated in june , no
calls were made to curtail load , therefore , charges 3472 and 3482 were not
utilized . the periods in which the demand relief program was called upon
to initiate interruptions of contracted loads can be found at the third link
below .

All this was done via the Debian installer, correct?

Also, you opted to have just one real partition, where everything is encrypted 
even /boot? So I take it you use a USB dongle to boot your system initially?

Or did you mean having /boot as normal and / as encrypted via LUKS then LVM2 
on top of /, with logical partitions within the LVM2. To put it visually:
/boot (normal)
/root (LUKS) -> LVM2 -> multiple parition

And lets rename Perl to Python. This is just change for the sake of change.

Dict also makes it sound like you are talking about pornography.  Of
course, hash makes it sound like you are talking about getting high.

Please provide the peer-reviewed study that proves this as it goes
against my experience.

snip

The Perl 5 people are already annoyed that . is changing to ~, sigils
are becoming invariant, etc.  Why not change the name of one of the
data structures too?  If we give them too many things to complain
about they won't be able to decide where to start!

snip

snip

They may be the same number of characters, but I can type hash without
leaving the home row on QWERTY keyboards, I don't know about Dvorak.

snip

snip

Right, because dictionaries have keys and values not terms and
definitions.  Of course, it all makes sense now.

Except of course those poor schmucks who foolishly wrote code like

howard operant sunburnt ::,"Weight is a major problem everywhere.  Many people battle the bulge every day and hope that they will find a diet that works for them.  However, you don't need a fad diet to lose weight.  You don't need expensive gym memberships either.  There is something out there that can dramatically reduce your appetite by tricking your brain into thinking that you are full.

http://www.ainizati.com/

People eat for lots of different reasons, hunger isn't the only one.  There are many reasons why people resort to food as a comforter but old habits die hard.  What if I were to tell you that there is a simple way to lose weight?  A way that, the television favourite, Oprah herself claims to work!  Want to know what she recommends?

http://www.ainizati.com/

Cosmetic surgeries and diets are quick and easy ways out but they also have side effects that can't be avoided, not only that but the bills from surgeries are astronomical!  Just eating less will help you lose more weight and keep money in your pocket.  Harder said than done?  Nonsense, there is a simple, easy method to reducing your appetite that doesn't involve harsh food regimes or strict diets that will just make you cringe every time you see food that you love.

fundamental operating standards,"i attach below a one page summary of control standards which are believed to
be fundamental . this summary , produced as a result of the doorstep review ,
could be a ' yardstick ' to benchmark our businesses - ie an aid to
communication between commercial , commercial support and rac re the level of
operating risk within each business and the region as a whole . consequently
it would be complimentary to the brm process .
i hope to complete an efficient / judgemental assessment internally for all
businesses in conjunction with rac and present the findings to yourselves (
and / or your desk managers ) within the next week / 10 days . the aim would also
be to establish that the currrent action plans for systems development and
support resource allocation is appropriate . the assessment would be based on
a traffic light scale ie
green inherent risk less processes / controls gives a residual operational risk
which is accpetable
amber - watch out - residual operational risk is high and / or control trend
is decreasing
red - stop now we have problem ( helsinki equivalent ! )
upon completion of the assessment i will book some time in your diaries

Please can we retain this parameter? Darwin does have true nested  
groups, so I'm not sure that I would want this behaviour on be default

real time deal updates to path manager - test group,"beginning this week , we are actively testing the changes to path manager to
receive real - time deal updates from sitara . to prepare for this , we would
like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick
walkthru / training of the new features sometime early next week . this should
only take about 30 minutes . once they are comfortable with the features and
performance , and once the testing is complete , we would like to migrate this
to unify production either next week or the week after . this should give us
an adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week .
once it is migrated to production , we can either roll it out to all
schedulers or to selected schedulers via security .
heather , could you please schedule some time with the designated schedulers ,

weather and crude,"the list of proposed netco employees that amy fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for weather and crude . do you contemplate that netco would trade those commodities / products ? bob hall ' s team that he has assembled for netco does not include anyone with either weather or crude operations experience .
we retained two top - notch operations individuals - todd hall and kevin sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for netco . both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation , risk books and settlements . todd and kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details .
todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for weather . prior to has role in egm , todd created the mpr and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio . he also has had extensive experience in gas risk management .
sweeney ' s most recent assignment has been to manage operations for eim . the bulk of his enron experience has been in crude and crude products . he was part of the original team that opened the singapore trading office and has experience in the uk as well .
if you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power , todd and kevin would both be great players to have on the netco team .

Usage of PARROT_API,"Hi,

I built Parrot for the first time in a while today and got errors like:

src\extend.c(78) : error C2375: 'Parrot_PMC_get_string_intkey' : 
redefinition; different linkage .\include\parrot/extend.h(60) : see 
declaration of 'Parrot_PMC_get_string_intkey'

If you use PARROT_API in a C implementation file (.c), you must make 
sure you also use it in the header file (.h). You can put it just in the 
header file and not in the implementation file and it's fine, but the 
other way round doesn't work. I have sprinkled PARROT_API in extend.h 
and io.h as required to get the Parrot executable to build - hopefully 
this is an OK thing to have done; I'm still catching up on what's been 
going on while I've been away.

Seems that nci_test.c has different, but related problems with 
inconsistent use of PARROT_API, though I've not time to look into this 
right now.

Thanks,

Jonathan",0

"senate approves edison rescue deal , assembly measure stalled","by jennifer coleman
associated press writer
sacramento ( ap ) - - the state senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by gov . gray davis to help the struggling utility southern california edison .
the bill approved friday , authored by democratic sens . richard polanco and byron sher , lets edison issue $ 2 . 5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record - high levels in the last year .
"" i believe it ' s a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity . . . and to bring this entity to creditworthiness , "" said polanco , d - los angeles .
approved 22 - 17 , the bill now goes to the assembly . the assembly adjourned friday night without voting on a similar measure .
the polanco - sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by edison , which says it won ' t help the company escape bankruptcy .
davis ' plan , announced in april , offers edison $ 2 . 76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $ 3 . 5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices .
under the plan by polanco , and sher , of stanford , the state has a five - year option to buy edison ' s grid .
that , said republican sen . ross johnson of irvine , gives edison a bailout it "" neither needs nor deserves .
"" i am tired of this projection of edison as a victim . they have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn ' t support deregulation , "" johnson said during floor debate . "" the idea of edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers . edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation . ""
during the 1995 - 1996 deliberations that led to deregulation , edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then - gov . pete wilson , a republican .
lawmakers are set to go on summer break friday night until aug . 20 , a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the memorandum of understanding between davis and edison . that says the legislature must approve the deal by aug . 15 .
"" it ' s a firm deadline , which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess , "" davis said friday .
for that to happen , either the senate bill or a proposal by assembly speaker robert hertzberg , d - van nuys , and assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek , has to reach davis .
"" i have problems with both bills , "" davis said . "" i am heartened by the fact that there ' s a bill moving in each house . ""
the keeley - hertzberg plan trims at least $ 300 million from the governor ' s offer . it also allows edison to issue the bonds , which would be repaid by edison ratepayers over 10 years .
the plan also attempts to increase the state ' s use of "" green "" energy resources and allow edison customers to opt for cheaper direct - access energy service .
the assembly didn ' t vote on the keeley bill friday , because hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the senate and the administration to "" iron out the bills ' differences , "" said hertzberg ' s spokesman paul hefner .
davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the aug . 15 deadline .
"" i don ' t want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on aug . 20 because i know we ' re going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month , "" the governor said .

timesheets for 2 / 15 and use of e - work orders for project hurricane,"just a reminder - timesheets need to be approved by 10 : 00 a . m . on tuesday ,
february 15 . this is necessary in order to meet the payroll deadline of
exporting time to eta ( the corporate payroll system ) , which is noon on
wednesday , february 16 . any timesheets that are not approved by the 10 : 00
tuesday deadline will automatically be approved by the energy operations
timesheet coordinator .
fyi - for the payroll period ending 1 / 31 , there was only 1 timesheet
outstanding at the established deadline . in the past , there have been as
many as 100 ( which represents a little more than 25 % of the energy operations
headcount ) . thanks for your help and support . i know that the assistants
all appreciate your help in meeting this deadline .
a lot of you may not be affected by project hurricane . if you don ' t know
anything about it , then you probably aren ' t affected by it ! in any event , we
have set up 2 new e - work orders in the org database for project hurricane .
they are as follows :
e - hurr ( should be used to capture all time spent on the ongoing support for
project hurricane )
e - hset ( should be used to capture all set - up costs )
both of these work orders are set up and can be used for the 2 / 15 pay
period . however , the following steps must be taken for your employees to use
the ates system and code their time to these work orders :
managers - identify employees within your rc that will need to charge time to
either or both of these work orders . please let your assistants know who
these employees are .
assistants - based on the information you receive from your managers , you
must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee ' s profile in the org
database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ates .
assistants - for each time site you are responsible for , you must be sure to
add this information to eta . if you aren ' t sure how to handle this , please
contact kim perkins asap at x 3 - 5304 .
thank you in advance for your cooperation in getting timesheets processed in
a timely manner . please be sure to share this information with your staff if
you haven ' t already done so . if you have any questions on the timesheets or
the work orders , please contact me at x 3 - 6343 .

i am meeting with scott josey on thursday regarding crescendo . i am going to propose to him that all of crescendo goes into ecr and he reimburses upstream products for incurred capital charges for 2001 . since ecr is utilizing nick cocavessis ' s technical services organization for all infrastructure needs and he reports to brian redmond , upstream products would not be charging ecr a fee . the technical services organization is commercial support for enron americas .
i have spoken to brian and he is fine with my proposal . in addition , josey and i have had a brief conversation and on thursday , i expect to be negotiating details .
regards , jean

bearing in mind this 35 % : 65 % split - how about we put it all in ecr and then you charge them a fee for all work you do on it .

your online sales are low because you don _ t have enough visitors ?,"submitting your website in search engines may increase your online sales dramatically .
if you invested time and money into your website , you simply must submit your website
online otherwise it will be invisible virtually , which means efforts spent in vain . if you want
people to know about your website and boost your revenues , the only way to do that is to
make your site visible in places where people search for information , i . e . submit your

from girl with hope,"Hello, dear

I hope that when you receive this letter, you won't close it without signs 
of attention and interest.
I am writing to you in order to suggest you to build  love and  romantic 
relations.
You may wonder why such attractive woman like me is still single. It is very 
simple answer at this question: I have not yet met the one who will turn 
upside down all my life.
I need such man who will appreciate not only my body, but see the beauty of 
my inner deep world.
I know that we are not acquinted, but I want to use this chance, because it 
can't repeat again.
So, I am happy to meet you. I am very glad to greet you in my life if you 
want.
You can believe me or not, but i am a woman-fire who can make your life more 
interesting and full of bright impressions.
how do you like the idea of mornings' breakfasts in the bed, romantic walks 
on week ends, happy family evenings after working days?
As for me I dream about it every day. I am tired to come at lonely home, to 
cook meal only for one person and to eat at loneliness and to go asleep at 
loneliness too. I want to come at home and to meet my beloved, to kiss him,
to cook him tasteful meal, to feel secured and happy every monrning and 
every night.
I will close this letter, but it doesn't ordinary letter, it is a call to 
build love and change your life to better and to forget about lonely days.
I will wait for letter with hopes in my heart

Dear list members,

I am analysing some microarray data. I have got the differentially
expressed genes and now want to carry out PCA analysis to get the main

BioConductor and did not find an appropriate package.

Have anybody ever carried out PCA analysis? Is there any package about PCA
in R?

Thanks for your advice.

I have a ""hack"" that makes it do it. It's how I tested it worked :-).

Change the line :

static int io_bufsize = 64512;

in client/client.c to something like :

static int io_bufsize = 0xFFFF00;

and then on the command line type :

posix 

then :

get bigfile

It'll use 0xFFFF00 sized reads then.

[R] Problem with binding data-frames,"Hello,

I'm having a problem concerning r-binding datasets.

I have six datasets, from six different plates, and two different days.
I want to combine these datasets together for analysis. Datasets from
day 2, have all the same columns than datasets from day 1. However in
addition, there are few columns more in day 2. Thus, using rbind for
this, results a error, because the objects are not the same length. 

Error in paste(nmi[nii == 0L], collapse = "", "") : 
        object ""nii"" not found
In addition: Warning message:
longer object length
        is not a multiple of shorter object length in: clabs == nmi 


What I need, is to combine all the six together, and give for example
NA-value in day 1, for those columns which can only be found in day 2.
Is this somehow possible?

I have several of these six-datasets groups, and only few of them are
having this problem described above, and I cannot know in advance which.
With most of the groups writing
rbind(data1,data2,data3,data4,data5,data6)
works easily, but these few problematic groups need also to be
combined... 
Any help greatly appreciated!

-Jouni

Anatrim  The latest and most attracting product for corpulent people is now readily available  As were told on CNN.

Can you count up all the cases when you appeal to yourself to do anything for being delivered from this desperately growing number of kilos? Fortunately, now no great price is to be paid. Thanks to Anatrim, the earth-shaking weight-reducing combination of elements, you can get naturally health mode of life and become really thinner. Have a look at what our customers say!

""Its rather difficult to acknowledge it but I was a junk food addict. 

I greedily swallowed up all this garbige 

and could not stop. 

This suffering stopped when I started taking Anatrim! 

Oh, God,

 my craving for food decreased, 

spirits improved and I became the happiest person 28 pounds in 2.9 months. 

So, I can tell you now I turned to the happiest person!""
 

Amelia B., Washington

 
""I had problems with over-weight since a boy. 

You can't even fancy how I detested being ridiculed at school. 

I hated my stoutness and I hated even myself. 

After trying this and that I found out about Anatrim. 

This stuff literally dragged me out of this horror! The warmest thanks to you, my friends.""

 
Mike Brown, San Diego

 
""Know what? Anatrim preserved my marriage! I got into the circle, depression  more eating  more depression. My wife was going to leave the overweight psycho I was turning in. 

One my best friend pointed at your site and I ordered pack of Anatrim at the same time. 

The results I achieved were great, my appetite came to normal level, I was in good spirits oftener, and, certainly, I tightened my belt with no regrets. And you see me, the bed became cool also!""

 
Dave

executive summary
? weekend developments of the socal mou
? socal & creditors weigh bankruptcy options
california senate adjourns without a bailout vote
as previously reported ( 9 / 14 ) , our prediction of sen . john burton discouraging support of the socal bailout did , in fact , play - out . burton ' s last minute vote polls indicated that there were only four senate democrats favoring the mou and an in extraordinary move , burton adjourned the senate without bothering to let ab 67 xx face a floor vote . the following outline the prevailing factors that led to burton ' s decision :
? reportedly , in addition to virtually no republican support , a coalition between at least 7 far left democrats and pro - business democrats convinced legislators not to vote on bailout legislation .
? at one point treasurer angelides pulled senator bowen aside and told her that the revenue bonds might sell with direct access after all . she then accused angelides of having lied to her about this in originally telling her that a bond sale would not be possible if direct access was included .
? both governor davis and treasurer angelides appear to have damaged their relationship with the senate . davis stated that he would not sign burton ' s legislation due to its ineffectiveness and additionally he would veto burton ' s bill separating the revenue streams for bond payment and payments for power .
given the state of relations in sacramento , senators are likely to offer little or no cooperation on a bailout plan if davis calls another emergency session . see burton ' s response ( paraphrased ) : "" i ' m going to be on jury duty , and i ' m not going to exercise my right to be excused . "" he ' s also not going to ask people to come back and , as of last saturday ( 9 / 15 ) , most people on the business democrat and republican side at least were not planning on doing so .
bankruptcy looms for socal
it currently looks bleak for socal . davis and bryson have expended their political capital on this effort . the creditors ' committee is reportedly meeting to discuss how , when and by whom a filing should take place . edison executives have assured davis that the company will not file for bankruptcy and that its creditors will show restraint . however , it ' s unclear whether all of the utility ' s creditors will forebear on an involuntary bankruptcy filing . spokespersons for several large generators said friday ( 9 / 14 ) afternoon that they couldn ' t speculate on what their companies would do if the legislature failed to act on the edison rescue bill that night . davis aides say the governor would seek a reduced rescue package for edison when the legislature returns , but in the meantime , davis continues informal negotiations with legislators in effort to stave - off socal ' s bankruptcy .",0

I thought that might happen.  I prefer this memset() patch, but if it doesn't 
work everywhere, your patch should work.

specal offer for wndows 20 oo advanced server,"minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said .",1

we would like to offer v _ i _ a _ g _ r _ a soft tabs ,
these pills are just like regular vìagra but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the
mouth and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which lasts as long as the normal .

Re: Slackware: kernel confusion,"My advice would be to grab the latest 2.6.21 kernel from www.kernel.org, 
patch Speakup into it, configure it, compile, and install.  Don't try 
anything 2.6.22 yet as it is still broken.

Here are the commands (or something close to what they would be) for doing 
this:
wget ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.21.5.tar.bz2

This will grab the kernel for you.  Switch to root and cp the file to 
/usr/src.  Then
tar xfv linux-2.6.21.5.tar.bz2
to untar it.

Get the checkout script from ftp.linux-speakup.org.  Place it in /usr/src 
and make it executable:
chmod +x checkout
make a symlink to the kernel source:
ln -s linux-2.6.21.5 linux
then run checkout.  Hit enter then give it the password of
please

After a very long time, the patch should succeed.  Switch to the kernel 
directory
cd linux
and read the README file.  Compiling the kernel can be done with the 
following general command set:

make mrproper
make menuconfig  # Menu driven program for selecting everything to put in 
kernel
make
make modules_install
cp -v arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage
cp -v System.map /boot/System.map

Remember to update lilo.conf and run the lilo command.

Good luck

we have noticed that we are taking earnings on megs this year which is probably the wrong thing to do based on the fact that we know that future income is negative we should be using the income to write down the holding or against future income .
can you reanalyse the bookings this year and ensure we do not book any earnings .

[R] Testing invertibility of an AR model,"I've looked around but I can't find the method in R for testing whether
the resulting estimated coefficients
of an AR model imply that the model is invertible.

To quote from eric zivot's blue book :

 "" the AR(p) is invertible provided the rots of the characteristic
equation

Phi(z) = 1 - phi_1*z - phi_2*z^2 = phi_3*z^3 - ..... Phi_p*z^p = 0 lie
outside
the complex circle"".

I can't find a function nor do I know how to do the above myself. I
think there is an equivalent method in which
 I can check whether the eigenvalues of some dual equation ( I forget
what it is ) are less than one but I don't 
remember exactly what that equation is and , even if I did, I still
wouldn't know how to do it.

Maybe checking whether the absolute of the sum of the coefficients is
less than one is okay ?
I remember doing that in another life but I'm not sure if that's an
approximation or an actual test.

	
Thanks for any help.

alex tartakovski,"as you may know , we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski
in houston this week . i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able
to coordinate this tomorrow . we just brought our new daughter home today and
my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office .
i just found out that thursday & friday are bad days for him , so wednesday is
the only day to do it this week . he would come down tuesday night and fly
out wednesday evening . it ' s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight ,
but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport . i gave him
donna ' s phone number for help . i assume the hyatt would be best . his home
number is 215 - 702 - 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 - 981 - 5425 .
by way of background , i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to
fill in some of the "" vacants "" in my group ' s org chart . the 3 areas of
specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are ( 1 )
coordination of origination , ( 2 ) deal pricing and underwriting , and ( 3 )
modeling and portfolio management . alex is the perfect person for # 3 . he
has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at
building analysis models , which will be a big job in this business because
portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness
of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating
these risks . development of pricing models will be a joint effort between
"" my "" group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the
expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are
being structured . i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava
and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research .
over the past 2 years , alex and i spent a lot of time developing new
electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels . i
would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well , and so
i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible . ( this could
possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -
( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him
working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .
i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m
not sure of this .
this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are
useful to us are :
probability / statistical model development
development of theoretical pricing methodology
excellent computer programming skills
database development and data analysis
he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of
mike curley , the nerc data manager .
designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products
for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .
excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to
hedging insurance portfolios .
if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .
can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real
tank through a minefield ) .
one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with
the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him
confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in
the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job
in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .
we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the
office for that , so we can do that next week .
please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up
but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .
thanks ,

neon september 13,"hey guys and girls ,
?
here ' s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon . ? this is
only an idea , you can use it or do something totally different . ? again , let
me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your
group so we can share in the wealth .
?
someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of
icebreaker - game type of activities , building community in youth groups , and
youth group trust builders . ? we all at one time had a selection of
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a
drawer . ? spend time in the games and forced interactions , especially over
the beginning of the semester . ? if you don ' t have these resources , let me
know . ? even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you , remember that
you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in
your group . ? but again , if you have any ideas for resources let me know .
?
in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic , a
couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders :
? ? ? - realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman
that their expectations of neon may not initially be met . ? they may be
coming in with ideas of what neon is , only to possibly be disappointed . ? in
a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people
have recommended it to you , and being a little let down . ? more importantly ,
they need to realize that neon is not an event , it is a process . ? the teens
who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough
to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common
experiences . ? with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly ,
their expectations will ultimately be met .
? ? ? - remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably
before or after neon , or at other non - neon times .
?
have fun loving on your kids wednesday !
?

The object lda() returns (assuming you are using lda) is all you need to 
do prediction.  So just use save() to 'save it to disk', and load() to 
retrieve it when you need it again.

re : project doorstep responsibility matrix,"thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments
arrive too late . here they are anyway :
1 socrates
i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have
primary responsibility for this system / project .
but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this
project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in
history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart .
2 exhaustive ?
it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such .
3 symptoms or causes ?
many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will
likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is
applied .
in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 :
"" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality . . . ""
because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation
errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think
about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move
on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they
did .
i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on
microsoft excel all day , everyday .
4 overall
i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking
off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate .
as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality ?

you can gain from lowest interest rates in 30 years,"certain chances only come around every few
decades or so . this is one . why you ask ?
because home loan rates are headed up .
have you locked in the lowest rate , in almost
thirty years , for your present home loan ?
rates haven ' t been this low in a long time . they
may well never be this low again . this is your
chance to secure a better future . you could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you ' ve been wanting or to take that special
vacation . why wouldn ' t you jump at this chance ?
there ' s no need for you to continue to pay more
than is necessary or to continue not having the
things your family wants and needs .
we ' re a nationwide mortgage lender . we ' re not a
broker . and we can guarantee you the best rate
and the best deal possible for you . but only
if you take action today .
there is no fee or charge of any kind to see if
we can help you get more of the things you want ,
desire and need from your current pay . you can
easily determine if we can help you in just a few
short minutes . we only provide information in
terms so simple that anyone can understand them .
you won ' t need to be a lawyer to see the savings ,
this we promise .
we offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you . or why you should replace
it . and once again , there ' s no risk for you . none

request for your unreserved asistance,"request for your unreserved asistance
from : branch manager
( union bank of nigeria plc )
marina lagos
dear sir ,
request for your unreserved asistance
firstly , i must solicit your confidence in this transaction , this is by virtue
of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret . though i know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried ,
but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have
been reliably informed of it ' s
swiftness and confidentiality .
let me start by first introducing myself properly to you . i am yakasia mohammed
a manager at the union bank nigeria plc , lagos . i came to know of you in
my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign
account requiring maximum confidence . a foreigner , an oil merchant / contractor
with the federal government of nigeria , until his death three years ago in
a ghastly air crash , banked with us here at the union bank plc , lagos , and
had a closing balance of usd $ 7 . 2 m ( seven million , two hundred thousand united
states dollars ) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by
any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a
discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage
here in nigeria .
fervent valuable efforts are being made by the union bank to get in touch
with any of his next of kin ( he had no known wife and children ) that the
management under the influence of our chairman , board of directors , retired
major general ( egbuna o egbu ) , that an arrangement for the fund to be declared
"" uncliamable "" and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for arms
and ammunition , which will further enhance the course of misunderstanding
among us here .
in order to avert this negative development , myself and some of my trusted
colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as
the next of kin so that the fund , usd $ 7 . 2 m , would be subsequently transferred
and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin .
all documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully
worked out and we are assuring you a 100 % risk free
involvement . your share would be 30 % of the total amount , while the rest
would be for myself and my colleagues for purposes in your country .
if this proposal is ok by you and you do not wish to take advantage of the
trust we hope to bestow on you and your company , then kindly get to me immediately
via my private e - mail address ( yakasiahaji 2 @ hotmail . com ) furnishing me with
your most confidential telephone , fax and e - mail , so that i can forward to
you the relevant details of this transaction .
thank you in advance for your anticipated co - operation
regards .
yakasia mohammed

It's that ""I'm not positive"" that scares me, because on the BSD box I  
was using it was in something that wasn't math.h, which surprised me.

So I did what I did.

harvard research visit,"harvard business school is doing a 5 - year business case study on enron .

1 . an overview of the modern giants research project
2 . descriptions of three broad areas of research interest ( business and
organizational design , new business creation , and capital investment
decision making ) together with the associated interview questions .
we fully understand that these interview questions are far too
encompassing , and that there ' s no way we could get through all of them in a
single , one - hour meeting . what we plan to do is "" specialize "" the interviews
by the background and expertise of participants . in some cases , we will
focus only on new business creation ; in others , we will focus primarily on
the allocation of capital ; in others we will focus on the basic economic
model that underlies the trading or energy services business . future visits
may focus on the remaining , unanswered questions , or on other areas of
interest of our faculty colleagues . these questions should therefore be
regarded more as a set of interests , rather than a strict protocol that we
will strive to complete from beginning to end .
hope this provides the necessary background for the trip .

[R] system() and R BATCH,"If I start from within R a new R batch job by using something like

system(""R CMD BATCH --no-save --quiet Rin.txt Rout.txt"",
		intern=FALSE, ignore.stderr=TRUE, wait=FALSE, input=NULL)

the job runs fine and smooth.
However, when, for any reason, I put twice ctrl+C in the calling R,  
it kills me the called batch job, too. This is not what I wanted. Ctrl 
+C is usually rather used to stop a loop etc. Why it stops the called  
batch jobs, too?

What can be the solution for me - avoiding the called batch jobs to  
be killable from the calling R process?

Best regards

Re: Assistance with a dual-core machine.,"This is not possible. You can not tell certain threads to run on certain 
cores without modifying the code itself. Also the problems with 
speechdup/speech dispatcher on multi-core systems relate to the fact that 
multiple threads run concurrently rather than running in a pre-emptive 
manner.
That is to say on a single core only one process runs at a time; with each 
process scheduled into running one after the other.

The code in speechdup/speech dispatcher needs to be rewritten to take into 
account the possibility of multiple threads running at once, and your only 
solution to running this stabily on your system is to disable your second 
core or run and test cvs code.
Without testers it will take far longer to debug these problems; and unless 
you are willing to run a single core you sacrifice stability regardless of 
whether the code is cvs or not.
cvs is not difficult to use; and you simply check out a source tree which 
you then build.

If you are not used to building from source; perhaps it is necessary to wait 
for the next stable release of these tools that will be stable and aware of 
smp systems.

believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students ( based on interest

that we could present in this order :
vince gives the enron overview presentation ( 30 minutes )
john gives the global technology specific presentation ( 20 minutes )
ashley goes over recruiting information at the end ( 10 minutes )
please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you
feel comfortable with the layout and content . i am meeting with john today
at 1 : 30 - vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that
would be great .
if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to contact me . 3 - 3589

hello everyone .
in december we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility . louise and i would like to get everyone together offsite , probably in late june ( once louise is back from holiday ( just kidding ) ) . i think it ' s time to go have a little fun with the group driving enron ' s success .
i would like suggestions as to :
1 ) where to go .
2 ) what should be the focus of the business meetings .

[R] An extension of Gabriel's biplot,"Hi All,

 

I would like to extend the standard biplot of Grabriel (1971), which is done
by the R function biplot().  Rather than just showing the variables as
vectors (with arrows at end point), I would like to show them as line
segments, where the segment runs from minimum value of the variable to its
maximum.  In other words, I would like to produce a plot similar to that
shown in Figure 1 of Gabriel and Odoroff (1990), rather than the classical
biplot shown in Figure 2 of the same paper.   Has anyone generated biplots
similar to Figure 1 of Gabriel and Odoroff?

 

Any help is greatly appreciated.

 

Best,

Ravi.

today we negotiated a handshake agreement with smith properties to buy out jedi ' s position in inland for $ 2 million ( $ 1 million net to enron ) . the dash minimum was $ 1 . 25 million ( $ 612 , 500 net to enron ) , the original offer . documentation will be simple : our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it . expect to close and fund next week .
given the inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred , i view this outcome as very favorable .

Chas, thank you, I don't think I would have found that error any time
soon.  I really appreciate it.  Also, thanks for the advice on how I'm
using the database, I think it is spot on and I am going to impliment
your suggestions.

For reference here is what I ended up with, I had to do the
placeholders in the select statement as well.

Replaced the comment code with the uncommented code:
    #$sql = ""SELECT * FROM area_status WHERE areaID='$values[0]' AND
survey_date='$values[1]' AND status='$values[3]'"";
    #$sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
    $sql = ""SELECT * FROM area_status WHERE areaID=? AND survey_date=?
AND status=?"";
    $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
    $sth->execute($values[0], $values[1], $values[3]) or die $dbh-
>errstr;;

and

#    if ($OK2INSERT) {
#        $dbh = DBI->connect(""DBI:SQLite:dbname=C:/Lanosrep/beW/Perl/
HelpPage/area.db"", """", """", {'RaiseError' => 1});
#        print "" Inserting into Database , @values."";
#        $dbh->do(""INSERT INTO area_status (areaID, survey_date,
update_time, status ) VALUES ('$values[0]', '$values[1]',
'$values[2]', '$values[3]')"");
#        $dbh->disconnect();
#    }
    if ($OK2INSERT) {
        #$dbh = DBI->connect(""DBI:SQLite:dbname=C:/Lanosrep/beW/Perl/
HelpPage/area.db"", """", """", {'RaiseError' => 1});
        print "" Inserting into Database , @values."";
        my $sth = $dbh->prepare('INSERT INTO area_status (areaID,
survey_date, update_time, status ) VALUES (?,?,?,?)');
        $sth->execute($values[0], $values[1], $values[2], $values[3])
or die $dbh->errstr;
        $sth->finish;

private email : ddrmtthwolas @ yahoo . com
i am an accountant in bank of africa benin ( boa ) . i was
also the personal account manager to mr sami abdurbu , a
west los angeles , california , who used to work in an oil company
here . on the 31 th of octomber 1999 my client , his
wife & their three children were involved in a an plan
crash , all occupants of the flight unfortunately
lost their lives .
since then i have made several enquiries to many
us embassy offices to locate any of my client ' s
extended relatives , this has also proved
unsuccessful . after these several unsuccessful
attempts , i decided to trace his last name over the
internet , to locate any member of his family but all
in vain . i am now contacting you to assist in
repatriating the money and property left - behind by
my client before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits
were lodged , particularly the bank of africa benin .
the deceased had an account valued at about
( $ 8 , 250 , 000 usd only ) eight million two hundred and
fifty thousand usdollars ) has issued me a notice to
provide the next of kin to the deceased or his
account will be confiscated or decleared
unserviceable .
since i have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over 5 years now , i am now seeking
your consent to present you as the next of kin of
the deceased customer . all you should do is to apply
to the bank as the next of kin and i will be
furnishing you with any informations related to the
deceased inorder to make the transaction a succesful
one .
all i require is your honest co - operation to enable
us see this transaction through . i guarantee that
this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you & i from any breach of the law .
please if this proposition is acceptable to you do
not hesitate to contact me fast .

subject : market update
market update
the market has opened with a weak tone this morning given the collapse in
equity futures - dow futures down 408 , s & p down 29 and nasdaq down 40 - and
the collapse of some recent new issues in the secondary market . ibm printed
a $ 1 . 5 bn five year yesterday at t + 117 that just traded at t + 130 . what is
leading the collapse in spreads ? bas has several observations :
* the absolute level of treasury yields will continue to result in new issue
supply that is priced at ever widening new issue premiums . most issuers are
more coupon sensitive than spread sensitive and , as a result , will be
willing to pay a large new issue concession given the attractive level of
overall coupons .
* although we have not seen it yet in the corporate bond market , an inverted
credit curve is not out of the question given the steepness of the treasury
curve . two and three year securities in particular , almost need to be
priced on a coupon basis .
* the technicals of the market are beginning to deteriorate . insurance
companies , traditionally the largest buyer of long assets , appetite for new
product may begin fade as claim estimates climb . balanced funds , may need
to begin selling to rebalance portfolios given the meltdown in the equity
market . the dealer community and the buyside is trying to hold on to market
gains for the year .
despite the negative tone , bas feels that issuers in the energy sector will
continue to have access to the primary market in the near - term ( albeit at
wider spreads ) due to the defensive nature of the sector and the absolute
implosion of other sectors ( autos , media , lodging , retail , airlines , etc ) .
please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions on the state of
the current marketplace .

dear lloyd & richard ,
i have been discussing with eric gadd about two particular areas of concern
that will affect the london research group . i believe there are a number of
issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk
management and quantitative analysis perspective , and i have put together a
( by no means exhaustive ) list : -
i ) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic
options linking perspective ( e . g . their spreadsheets link to different option
pricing add - ins )
ii ) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we
can capture metals risk in our var system ( we will require historical data
for this ) . i am sure bjorn will be looking to the research group to assist
in this matter .
iii ) ensure that mg staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our
methods and systems and vice versa
these tasks will involve a significant degree of cross - communication with
relevant contacts within mg metals , and so i look forward to starting on the
process as soon as possible - i hope to play a full part from a quantitative
research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes
smoothly in this exciting new development , so please do not hesitate to

Hi Pedro,
You can use the Mann-Whitney test (""wilcox"" with two samples), but you 
would have to check that the second and third moments of the variable 
distributions were the same, I think.

Hello. I'm not sure if this is useful to anyone, but I wanted to throw
it out just in case.
The scroll lock, under Linux at least, can be used for its intended
purpose - to freeze the screen. If scroll lock is on, anything written
to your terminal will be suspended. When you turn it back off again, any
newly written text will start to be written. In a shell at least, you
can press control-s and control-q to get the same affect, most of the

subject : killed trades
it has come to light that there have been a number of enrononline
transactions which have been "" undone "" after the fact .
these are situations in which an enrononline trade has been completed , but we
have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not
have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation .
it is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an
enrononline trade appear as though it is not firm , or not reliable , or which
affects the audit process .
therefore , enrononline transactions must not be killed .
individual traders might elect to conduct an otc transaction which has the
effect of reversing the impact of an enrononline transaction - this activity
is outside the scope of enrononline .
please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a
system error on enrononline which caused a trade to take place which was not
initiated by the customer . all instances to date have involved some kind of
operator error , or failure to use the results of a transaction search to
verify completed deals .

[R] t-values for two-way interactions,"I have a model with 3 fixed factors (type, stress, MorD) and two 
significant two-way interactions (type*stress, stress*MorD).

I would like to find out more about the type*stress interaction, e.g. how 
the levels of type differ between stress. More specifically I want to find 
a t-value for the pairwise comparisons:

typePr:stressN vs. typePsPr:stressN
typePr:stressPN vs. typePsPr:stressPN

I can't do this with the summary table (above) as it always includes the 
factor MorD (mis/dis) in each pairwise comparison, i.e. it provides 
t-values for

typePr:stressN:MorDmis and typePsPr:stressN:MorDmis 
typePr:stressN:MorDdis and typePsPr:stressN:MorDdis 

Is it possible to look at interaction of type*stress over MorD and NOT 
within MorDmis or MorDdis?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

averaging approximately 3 , 850 dth / day for january , and has been producing at

however , carol was brought online this past week , and i will be receiving
production information on a regular basis to balance redeliveries .
we have been scheduling 838 to 1 , 045 dth / day at the meter . we need to gross

organisational announcement - introducing enron global markets,"as evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter ,
enron  , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
experience tremendous growth . the opportunities to continue to grow our
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
enron  , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets .
it is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of
gas and electricity , which can make significant contributions to our earnings
growth . we have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
north america , europe , and most recently in our new net works business unit .
included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products ,
coal , emissions , insurance , currency , equity trading , interest rates , credit
trading , paper and pulp , and metals .
while significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in north america
and europe . in order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today
announcing the formation of a new business unit  ) enron global markets . this
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in
scope , but outside our traditional gas and power markets . this new core
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with
the north american and european businesses .
enron global markets will be headed by mike mcconnell , president and chief
executive officer , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer . they will
report to mark frevert who will be chairman of enron global markets . mark ,
mike and jeff will comprise the office of the chairman for enron global
markets .
included in this new business unit and reporting to the office of the
chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders :
- global crude and products : john nowlan
- coal : george mcclellan
- currency , equities , interest rate and agricultural trading : gary hickerson
- insurance and weather : jere overdyke
enron  , s metals business and enron credit . com will remain the responsibility
of enron europe . the paper and pulp business will continue to reside in north
america .
with the departure of mike mcconnell from enron net works , we are pleased to
announce the following appointments in that business unit :
- jeff mcmahon : president and chief operating officer
- louise kitchen : chief commercial officer
- philippe bibi : chief technology officer
jeff , louise and philippe , along with greg whalley , will comprise the office
of the chairman for enron net works .
with jeff shankman  , s departure from enron north america  , s natural gas
operation , all of jeff  , s direct reports will report to john lavorato .
we are also pleased to announce the following changes to the enron north
america office of the chairman . john lavorato will join the ena office of
the chairman as chief operating officer . dave delainey will assume the role
of president and chief executive officer . mark frevert will retain his role

while we are at it:
:: and & are _really_ sigils for variables?
They seem (to me) more akin to a literal syntax, and I wonder what would 
happen in a case like this:

sub foo {}
sub bar {}
# currently syntax error in pugs, but if is a variable sigil
# why I can't have it on a variable?
my &foo = &bar;
&foo('hello')

I have to understand that
  &foo = &somefunction
is actually redefining the foo() sub?

If not, which gets called in the above case? can I have access again to 
the original &foo sub here?

and in these context

multi foo(Int $i) {...}
multi foo(Str $i) {...}

my &foo = &foo &foo('hello')

do I get an error, since we are using the variant defined for Ints or is 
the multiple dispatch called again?

Same for ::
  ::Object = $?GRAMMAR
is guaranteed to explode in my face or is it just a syntactic error (as 
it currently is in pugs) ?",0

vince ,
i just found out that none of my vacation days from the last year is in the
computer system
( it says that i have 0 c / over days ) .
it was november 3 , 1999 when i asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation
days to the next year .
i was thinking that if you ( or hr ) do not approve i could at least take these
days in 1999 .
i know that your tried to help me and sent to brad mcsherry the
justification for me to carry over 10 days .
i bothered you a few times in november and december 1999 and since your
response was optimistic
i did not take any of those 10 days in 1999 . but i never heard from hr .
now i am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake .
i would like to take 5 of them in march ( from 3 / 13 / 00 to 3 / 17 / 00 ) .
what is your advice ? should i contact brad mcsherry ? even negative response
from hr in november or
december last year would be better than loosing vacation days .
i really appreciate your help ,
tanya .

sorry to bother again with my question .
i first e - mailed my question a month ago ( on nov . 3 ) .
since we still have not heard from hr , is it fair to assume that i can carry
over my 10 vacation days to the next year ?
if not - i have to take 5 days before dec . 17 , because then i go on vacations
anyhow . i would really prefer not to take off
most of december , there are quite a lot of things going on .
thank you for your help in resolving this question .

I think you've got it, except it doesn't stop with the 5. Unless I'm
missing something, that substitution means the same thing as this
simpler one:

    s#(\d)#$1#g

Unless the value of $1 is useful, it's hard to see what good this
does. It replaces each digit with itself. As side effects it affects
all the match variables, and it stringifies its target.

Did you find that piece of code somewhere? Do you know what its author
was trying to do?

I don't understand the rational for such patches nor the mem_allocate_.*typed 
wrappers. malloc(3) and friends are returning a (void *) pointer, a type 
which fits all memory related (i.e. non-function) pointers.

Did I miss something?

You could try reading the help page or the 'R Data Import/Export' manual.
Both point out things like

      'read.table' is not the right tool for reading large matrices,
      especially those with many columns: it is designed to read _data
      frames_ which may have columns of very different classes. Use
      'scan' instead.

On the other hand I am surprised at several minutes, but as you haven't 
even told us your OS, it is hard to know what to expect.  My Linux box 
took 3 secs for a 6000x40 matrix with read.table, 0.8 sec with scan.

something seriously wrong with the assistive tech market as a

el paso and coastal announce their merged structure and office,"locations
el paso , coastal consolidate pipeline staff
el paso energy and coastal corp . announced plans yesterday to relocate more
than 1 , 200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the el paso natural
gas headquarters in el paso , tx , and the anr pipeline headquarters in
detroit , mi , once their merger is approved by the ftc , which is expected
sometime in the fourth quarter . no final decision on staff reductions has
been made , an el paso spokeswoman said .
the companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline
systems into three organizations , collectively led by john w . somerhalder ii .
under the consolidation plan , the combined company ' s nationwide pipeline
system will be consolidated into three regional operations . the western
region will consist of el paso natural gas company and colorado interstate
gas company and will be headquartered in colorado springs , co . the eastern
region will consist of anr pipeline and tennessee gas pipeline and will be
headquartered in houston . southern natural will make up the southeastern
region headquartered in birmingham , al .
john somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the el paso
pipeline group . patricia a . shelton , currently president of el paso natural
gas , will lead the consolidated western region pipelines . jay holm , currently
responsible for el paso ' s australian pipeline assets , will return to the
united states to become ceo of the eastern region . reporting to holm as
presidents of tennessee and anr will be stephen c . beasley and james j .
cleary , respectively . the southeastern region will be led by james c .
yardley , who will continue as president of southern . shelton , holm , and james
yardley will report to somerhalder .
"" this consolidation will create the most effective organization for el paso ' s
pipeline system , "" said el paso ceo william a . wise . "" our upcoming merger with
coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation ,
border to border and coast to coast . this consolidation represents a highly
disciplined approach to managing this system , allowing us to strike a proper
balance between customer focus and operational efficiency . it also
facilitates a company - to - company exchange of expertise across our system and
speeds the merging of separate company cultures . ""
while the companies will be organizationally merged , the five pipeline
systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names . though
many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be
consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters , field functions and
related activities will remain in their current locations . in addition , some
employees will remain in the el paso and detroit locations . the company will
ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation .
those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages .
most moves will occur during the first half of next year , and the majority of
the plan is expected to be implemented by mid - 2001 .
the companies announced their $ 16 billion polling - of - interests transaction in
january ( see daily gpi , jan . 19 ) . the merger is expected to be accretive to
el paso ' s earnings per share ( eps ) immediately and add more than 5 % to eps in
both 2001 and 2002 , wise said at the time of the merger announcement .
overall , the two companies expect $ 200 million in cost savings . by
comparison , the el paso - sonat merger created more than $ 100 million in
savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs .
the combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist
of over 58 , 000 miles of pipeline , by far the most of any pipeline company in
north america . the system will transport more than 20 bcf / d of gas through
existing pipeline infrastructure , but will have sole or part ownership in
three other new or proposed major pipelines , including alliance , gulfstream
and independence . the company also will be the second largest gatherer of
natural gas in the united states and the third largest u . s . producer of gas .

New Revision: 23023

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23023

Log:
Get rid of the only caller of message_send_pid_with_timeout(). This replaces
the timeouts on the individual message send calls with an overall timeout on
all the calls.

The timeout in message_send_pid_with_timeout() did not make much sense IMO
anyway, because the tdb_fetch() for the messages_pending_for_pid was blocking
in a readlock anyway, we ""just"" did the timeout for the write lock.

This new code goes through the full wait for the write lock once and then
breaks out of sending the notifies instead of running into the timeout per
target.

Jerry, please check this!

Thanks,

Volker

listed below are the details of each days problems :
fri , sep 8 , 2000
autorho failed at 3 : 15 am , uploaded only 8 books into infinity .
it failed on the step in autorho where it runs the query to get all the books
for the infinity usd portfolio . jeremy does not know exactly what caused it
but rerunning autorho seemed to work .
recovery used the backup file and was on time .
tue , sep 12 , 2000
similar problem to friday , but enpower also failed . the manenpower . txt file
had tns errors in it . autorho was not able to kick off the enpower script to
get the cashflows . rerunning fixed the problem .
autorho failed at 3 : 15 am , uploaded only 9 books into infinity .
it failed on the step in autorho where it runs the query to get all the books
for the infinity usd portfolio . jeremy does not know exactly what caused it
but rerunning autorho seemed to work .
recovery used the file that jeremy provided in the rerun , they were
approximately 10 minutes late .
wed , sep 13 , 2000
enpower failed creating a header only manenpower . txt file . there was no
cashflows in the file .
jeremy confirmed the autorho process was fine .
the problem was the enpower databse failed ( hardrive failure ) and they
immediately went to a backup . but on the backup database , not all the tables
are replicated . the cashlow table with the enpower data we needed was not in
the backup database resulting in a file with zero flows !
this problem has been fixed by the enpower people .
recovery included using the previous day ' s enpower flows . they were on time .
thurs , sep 14 , 2000
autorho at 3 : 15 am and 11 : 00 pm was hung . enpower also was not run since
autorho failed .
reason was because the unix nfs file system "" solar "" was full as a result ,
our directory / worksheets 2 , and also / prod / egs - home is mounted on solar but
could not write anything to it . supposily the sa are suppose to have been
paged when ever a file system gets close to 100 % ( can you please confirm
this ? ) . the unix nfs was fixed by 5 : 00 am . autorho was rerun and was fine .
recovery included jeremy ' s file . they were 1 hour late ( partly due to other
reasons on mo side , not system related ) .
thanks ,

subject : visit from stanford ?
dear dr . kaminski ,
let me briefly introduce myself , i am the director of corporate relations
for the school of engineering at stanford university . in this role , i am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions .
i believe you know hill huntington , who is a senior researcher with
stanford ' s energy modeling forum . he suggested i get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at enron . i ' m in the process of planning a trip
to texas in early may along with my colleague donna lawrence , the
university ' s director of corporate relations . we were hoping to be able to
include a stop at enron on our itinerary . right now it appears that friday ,
may 4 th would work best for us but we ' re at the very beginning of our trip
planning .
the purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between enron and stanford , to give you an overview of current priorities
in the school of engineering , and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact .
i look forward to hearing from you about your availability ,
sincerely ,
susan hansen

Samba with Autocad Sheet Set Manager,"Hello,

We are a 30-person architectural office in Sacramento, California, using 
AutoCAD 2006 on Windows.  Our main file server is running Samba 
3.0.10.1.4E.6 on RedHat Enterprise ES 4.

This release of AutoCAD has something called a ""Sheet Set Manager,"" 
which uses a master file (.dst file) which needs to be open and 
accessible to all project users while they are working on their 
projects.  AutoCAD does not lock this file when it opens it.  The Linux 
permissions are set correctly on these files.  Samba is also not locking 
the files - smbstatus -L | grep .dst returns nothing.

The problem is that only the owner of the file is able to write to the 
file - something is locking it.  One post I've read refers to the 
""sticky bit,"" and perhaps that's what's causing the problem, but I don't 
know exactly what that is or how to fix the problem.

I've tried moving the file to a share on a newer server - Samba 
3.0.14a-6ubuntu1.2 running on ubuntu 5.10 - Breezy, but the problem 
still exists.  I've set up a share on a Windows 2000 Pro (not server) 
desktop, and the files work as they should. 

I could, I guess, continue to run this way except for the fact that a 
Windows desktop can only accept 10 connections at one time.

I really, really, really do not want to have to buy a Windows server to 
fix this problem, but I do have to fix it.  If anyone can shed some 
light on this, it would be very, very much appreciated.

Thanks.

Re: Stopping Speakup while using Gnome.,"Hello,
    This simply isn't working for me--I've killed Speakup on TTY7, after 
starting Gnome and Orca, but the speakup keypad review keys still say blank, 
and preempt Orca's review keys.  Could the fact I'm using a software 
synthesizer have something to do with this?  Is this a bug fixed in later 
Speakup versions?
Thanks,
Zack.

Dear valued member.
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores  USDrugs  has proved its meds to be 100% generic.

desks for approximately $ 45 , 000 . the recording device will be located in
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders . all equipment is in
stock and we can have the desks recorded by december 1 . i need a quick
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until friday
afternoon for us . barry , can you give the ok ?
also , recording for the chicago office should not be an issue since the

subject : update on employee expense reimbursement
post - petition expenses
effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp . ' s chapter 11 filing ( after december 2 nd ) has returned to normal . expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission . employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors . new travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming . in the meantime , please use discretion as you incur expenses . all expenditures should be made with consideration given to enron ' s current financial situation .
pre - petition expenses
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .

Dhanoa Minerals Modernization Effort Producing Additional
Revenues of $5,500,000 From ''Tailings''
http://leadgenngroup.com/cgi-bin/clickthru/6481/2439/92258

TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dhanoa Minerals, Ltd (OTCBB:DHNA - News; FWB:D7Z) announced today that the company is re-processing ""tailings"" at its recently acquired ""Spanish Plant.""
Tailings are the raw ore material remaining after the gold and silver extraction process has been completed. Tailings often contain precious metals, which are nearly as valuable as the already processed metals.

Tailings are the raw ore material remaining after the gold and  silver extraction process has been completed. Tailings often contain  precious metals, which are nearly as valuable as the already processed  metals. While difficult to exactly estimate the value of tailings left  behind at the company's mining properties as well as at the company's  newly acquired refining and processing Spanish Plant, initial results  indicate that the tailings contain a minimum of 1.7 grams of gold and  as many as 6 grams of silver per ton. The dollar value of the  reprocessed tailings could amount to as much as $37 per ton. Based upon current production of 500 tons per day, the tailings  could be worth a minimum of $18,500 per day as additional revenues,  which equates to an additional $5,500,000 per year. As mining techniques become more efficient, and with the  implementation of modernization practices coupled with the increased  market price of gold and silver, reprocessing additional minerals,  previously more difficult and costly to extract, has become  increasingly economically feasible. In addition, re-processing tailings serve to restore some of the  ecological damage caused by traditional mining practices. Mr. Lee Balak, President of Dhanoa stated, ""Native Ecuadorian  mining methods are very crude and inefficient. They leave behind a  significant amount of tailings that Dhanoa Minerals can now profitably  mine. Re-processing these tailings will provide substantial added  revenue for the company. We at Dhanoa Minerals are committed to  environmentally-conscious mining practices. We believe that reducing  the harmful environmental effects of gold and silver mining to be in  the interest of both the citizens of Ecuador, as well as our  shareholders."" About Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. 'Dhanoa' is a production stage company formed for the purpose of  acquiring, exploring, and developing natural resource properties.  Activities during the production and exploration stage include further  development of the Company's business plan and raising capital. The  Company has recently initiated a new program to evaluate undervalued  assets for potential addition to its mineral claim portfolio. Wish to no longer get mail, rmove here",1

They are a name-change clause: without the name change the license is

It just serializes the state of the browser from time to time in a

Thanks a lot, Hank!

I've been supporting your suggestion ever since I had created
'R-packages' ( = ""R package announcements mailing list"").

As moderator, I even occasionally rejected postings to
R-packages exactly by requiring such short information preceding
any notice of changes.

I think that >99% of the package authors would also agree, but
then we are all humans and hence sometimes get into peculiar
world views such as ""there's my package, and there's R and then
rest of the universe"" ;-)

ibuyit project,"i wanted to share some great news with you about a major corporate initiative
within ets , called the ibuyit project , that you should know about and be
looking forward to . ibuyit is a tool that will make it easier for you to
purchase the things you need to get your job done and / or to operate our
business . some key points related to ibuyit are :
? employees at all levels across ets will be able to access ibuyit on their
computers much like the enron intranet . ibuyit provides an upgrade to the
existing b 2 b web - based procurement tool .
? ibuyit will utilize a new catalog system ( requisite ) that will make it
easier for you to identify material items and incorporate them into the
requisition .
? ibuyit will not only make it simple for you to buy on - line , but it can also
serve as your single , convenient source to access other tools and information
you use everyday at enron .
stan horton , rod hayslett , and phil lowry decided back in december that ets
would take the lead by being the first business unit to begin working with
global strategic sourcing ( gss ) , who is developing ibuyit . both field and
houston - based ets employees have been involved with ibuyit efforts to - date to
help determine how ibuyit can best be used to support our employees and our
business . more of you will be involved as the ibuyit project progresses .
ibuyit will be deployed to ets , corporate , ebs , ees , and ews in a phased
approach during the first three quarters of 2001 . starting in april , ibuyit
will be available to certain groups of ets employees for the purchase of
office supplies and travel . ibuyit will be implemented on a full scale
across ets in july .
those of you in engineering may be aware of the ongoing mlrp efforts and may
be wondering about the impact of ibuyit . because of the unique nature of its
business , engineering has decided to continue moving forward with mlrp . but ,
we will also continue to explore ways for ibuyit to complement mlrp and
benefit engineering  , s business .
as the person ultimately responsible for ibuyit  , s success within ets , i

max :,"i would like to organize a vitro project review meeting during the next several weeks focusing on the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation measures we taking . the objective of the meeting is to ensure all related enron entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to ask questions . this will reduce the chance that we will run into objections down the road on "" technical risks "" as we begin to ramp up our capital commitments . we had a similar meeting with the electrobolt team in enron s . america , that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives .
do you have a project presentation that you ( and / or the lead developer ) could discuss with the above team ? we could do it by phone - or better yet - the next time you are in houston . as many of the technical risk issues are also tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas as well ( e . g . , commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical design and implementation strategy ) .
i don ' t mean to be sticking my nose into your deal , other than to ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction so that we can get this implemented successfully .
let me know as to your availability ,

i ' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 ( as far as getting it out of my allocation

hear back from daren or julie .
should daren or julie get back w / you , while i ' m on vacation , please get back
w / anita luong and provide her with the k # given to you ( by daren or julie )
as well as the dates of 2 / 1 - 2 / 29 ( even though 3 / 1 / 2000 is reflected in my

arrangement to place february ' s volumes on @ this meter .
it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the

attention ! ! ! can you be honest ?,"from : 1002 lausanne
switzerland
dear friend .
my name is ms . lioudmila oconnor a member of independent
committee of eminent persons ( icep ) , switzerland . this committee
is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in
switzerland belonging to non - swiss indigenes , which have remained
dormant since world war ii .
it may interest you to know that in july of 1997 , the swiss banker ' s
association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by
non - swiss citizens . these accounts had been dormant since the end of
world war ii ( may 9 , 1945 ) . most belonged to holocaust victims .
the continuing efforts of the independent committee of
eminent persons have since resulted in the discovery of additional
dormant accounts - 54 , 000 in december , 1999 .
the published lists contain all types of dormant accounts , including
interest - bearing savings accounts , securities accounts , safe deposit
boxes , custody accounts , and non - interest - bearing transaction
accounts . numbered accounts are also included . interest is paid
on accounts that were interest bearing when established .
the claims resolution tribunal handles processing of all claims on
accounts due non - swiss citizens . a dormant account of ( the deceased )
with a credit balance of 21 , 000 , 000 us dollar plus
accumulated interest was discovered by me . the beneficiary was
murdered during the holocaust era , leaving no will and no possible
records for trace of heirs . the claims resolution tribunal has been
mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of
accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury
of switzerland government as provided by the law for management of
assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate ( living no
wills ) .
being a top executive at icep , i have all secret details and necessary
contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch . the funds will be
banked in a safe haven and we can share the funds and use in
investment of our choice . due to the sensitive nature of my job , i
need a foreigner to help claim the funds .
all that is required is for you to provide me with your details for
processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents
for transfer of the funds to you , to this regard , you are expected to
fill out a text form . i will pay all required fees to ensure
that the fund is transferred to a secured , numbered account in your
name , where you will be capable of accessing the funds and gradually
transfering to your country and other
banks of choice in the world . there is no risk involved .
you can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the
internet at the following websites :
www . swissbankclaims . com
www . wiesenthal . com
the holocaust claims processing office has put funds in escrow
awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement .
i find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a
great opportunity for a life time of success without risks . due to
confidential reasons , reply via email only . you may reply to me
securely through this email address ( lioudmila . lioumila @ gmx . net )
i await your urgent response to this proposal via my email address .
thank you for your prompt response .
my regards

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .

[R] [R-pkgs] MiscPsycho Package 1.0,"I have just submitted MiscPsycho to CRAN. MiscPsycho contains functions
for miscellaneous psychometrics that may be useful for applied
psychometricians. MML estimation already exists in the ltm package.
Hence, a jml option is provided for users who prefer this method. The
jml function gives back rasch difficulties and the same Infit and Outfit
statistics as Winsteps. 

Also, jml is known to return biased parameter estimates. So, a
correction for jml bias is provided for as an optional argument in the
function. Currently, the package includes the following:

1) jml() a function for joint maximum likelihood estimation of the Rasch
model
2) alpha() , coefficient alpha
3) alpha.Summary(), gives what alpha would be if item i were excluded
3) scoreCon(), create score conversion tables, 
4) class.acc(), classification accuracy statistics 
5) simRasch(), simulate Rasch item responses 
6) classical(), point-biserial and p-values 

Future versions will include Master's partial credit model, DIF
statistics, procedures for linking scales (e.g., Stocking-Lord), lattice
graphics for item characteristic curves, and bayesian scoring methods
(EAP).

california update 5 / 29 / 01,"executive summary
? california treasurer angelides sets dates for bridge loans & bonds
? california ' s supreme court may see challenge to "" plan b ""
angelides on bridge loans and bonds
ca treasurer angelides has said that beginning 15 august , the state will set up a bridge loan . the revenue bonds will not be issued until september or october . angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in july or august . however , he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in october and november . this is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the dwr and from other parts of the government , not on payment terms for power . he fears there will be a cash management problem .
california supreme court to challenge "" plan b ""
california attorney michael sturmwasser is expected to challenge "" plan b "" before the california supreme court on the basis that it results in a retroactive rate increase and that it removes the puc ' s authority to review power purchases . this is because "" plan b "" enables socal to collect a dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going forward . socal ( and pg in other words , it has a fair chance of succeeding . however , regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails , it is very likely to cloud the issue of the bail - out and significantly deflate the prospects of the plan b .
if ferc were to impose cost - based controls on power prices , sources believe it might "" go a long way toward avoiding these problems . "" were this to happen , the puc could declare ferc ' s rates "" just and reasonable , "" which would likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep socal liquid . however , such measures by ferc require significant lead time . sources state that "" the state needs to tease the feds into doing this . "" this can be done by conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data ferc would use for determining the cost controls . sources report that this process of "" teasing "" ferc has not yet started . this is chiefly because california politicians are focused on flat price caps , which ferc is very unlikely to impose . it appears the state is asking ferc for the wrong measures , which is delaying the process . the only way for the state to avoid these constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities , as municipal entities would not be subject to puc regulation . however , there remains very significant opposition to this idea , especially on the republican side . a state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain momentum once plan b began to fail for the reasons cited above . additionally , a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were both utilities in bankruptcy .
sturmwasser is a partner at sturmwasser & woocher , a santa monica law firm . ( his offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in santa monica , overlooking the beach . ) he has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years . his clients include the consumer advocacy group turn ( toward utilities rate normalcy ) , among others . sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to support the legal challenge , but if he cannot find money elsewhere , he will likely be able to support it out of his own pocket .",0

vince ,
he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background ( and then some
credit exposure calculation ) with not much credit data analysis experience .
i do not think he would be appropriate for bryan ' s group - - he needs a person
who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data , and although
this guy may be good at modeling , we already have iris and amitava doing the
modeling and looking at data . at this stage , i would prefer to hire somebody
with direct experience in credit analysis ( banking , rating agency ) . i am
worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience , then
amitava will find himself with two people ( iris being the other one ) who are
both inexperienced in this area , and he will find himself doing a lot of the
work anyway .
if you want to pursue him , we should probably do a phone interview first .

The
  next unless /^(\S+)/;
serves two purposes. First it makes sure you do not try to process 
lines that are empty or start with whitespace (whether that's likely 
to happen or not I have no idea) and it captures the first ""word"" 
from the line so that you can access it via $1.

The magic is in the regular expression

  /^(\S+)/

The \S means ""any character except whitespace, the + means one or 
more such characters, the () mean that you are interested in those 
characters and the ^ means that you are searching for thise non-
whitespace characters in the beginning of the string only.

So that line could be read as

  go read the next line if the current one doesn't start with non-
whitespace characters. If it does, remember them in $1.

EntreMetrix Pursues China Joint Venture Alliance for Advanced Nitride
Monday June 25, 9:00 am ET 


IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EntreMetrix, Inc. (OTCBB:ERMX - News) today discussed the pursuit of a joint manufacturing alliance in China for Advanced Nitride Devices. The joint venture plan calls for a China-based alliance partner to invest in the building of a wafer production operation to serve the larger semiconductor device manufacturing community in China.

Discussing the alliances under consideration for Advanced Nitride EntreMetrix CEO Scott W. Absher stated that ""concern for more balanced trade between the US and China has encouraged an investment interest by China in joint ventures with US-based companies to develop technologies to be manufactured in China. The development of a joint manufacturing venture to produce Gallium Nitride (GaN) semiconductor technology under Advanced Nitride Devices makes a great deal of sense at this time. Clearly the manufacturing influence in China and the quest to pursue next-generation technologies using Gallium Nitride technology offer enormous opportunity.""

The evaluation process has begun and is expected to produce an alliance partner by Q4 of 2007.

EntreMetrix plans to develop a number of portfolio investment scenarios in its quest to increase the Company's net asset value. The Company intends to accelerate its Business Development platform by using its expertise in capital formation, strategic growth and public market entry to the benefit of its eligible portfolio companies. EntreMetrix's expertise provides unique advantages for its eligible portfolio companies, including the possibility of creating a liquid market for the companies' securities. The Company's plan includes equity distribution of each portfolio company to EntreMetrix shareholders of record at the time of a public market entry of the Company's portfolio investments.

About EntreMetrix: Based in Irvine, California, EntreMetrix is a Business Development Company, regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and a provider of essential structural and financial support services to small business clients throughout the United States. The Company's structural support services create value for clients by providing expertise in the areas of employee and financial management -- eliminating the need for clients to manage non-core functions.

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .",0

re : digitals,"pavel , many thanks for your note .
i understand that digitals are not core enron business but as you know , i ' m
trying to explore digitals to give , for example , a company a guaranteed
income in year one ( to mop up expiring tax losses ) . this is offset by a
guaranteed expense in year two . see attached hypothetical example . the
digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to
and would be part of a price risk management strategy , thereby giving it
' commercial purpose ' .
i would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject - - the
rational for using digitals and your knowledge of its use in other markets
( electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector ) .
it seems to me that setting the srike is key and a ' value judgement ' or am i
wrong , and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate
this ? in any event , do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or
likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it
becomes non arm ' s length and does not pass the smell test ?
vince , jarek suggested that you may be able to assist . your views would also
be appreciated .

subject : digitals
digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market . nobody ever
asked me to show quotes in the otc market . the only time we encountered them
was when producers , brought by our marketing team , wanted to sell a
knock - outable swap , whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange
for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level . this
structure had a digital put embedded in it , although the customers didn ' t
necessarilly know that . the companies were us oil and gas producers : venoco ,
titan , magnum hunter , patiena oil & gas , belco , central resources . it was
about 1 year ago . in the otc market , at about the same time , i asked for
quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital cal 00 $ 16 swaption to
elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that i cannot recall .
i hope this helps .

california update 6 / 25 / 01,"executive summary
? california budget resolved
? ferc ordered energy settlements stall mou / plan b
budget
california legislators in the house have once again established a tentative reserve amount for the state ' s depleted budget . both sides are reportedly uneasy with the $ 2 . 74 b compromise and sources indicate that the four republican votes needed to pass the budget in the assembly are likely far more obtainable than the one republican vote needed in the senate . california ' s current redistricting process may provide republicans with future seats that could translate into immediate bargaining power in energy and budget matters . adding to the frustration , sources indicate that consumer activist harvey rosenfield plans to pressure state treasurer angelides into battling with legislators for progress on the budget and revenue bonds .
energy settlements
today marked opening negotiations for california state energy officials and the several large energy providers who are charged with price gouging californians . sources close to california state sen . burton report that the results from thel 5 days of negotiations before the ferc appointed administrative law judge , curtis wagener , will significantly influence the state ' s efforts in promoting any plan b or mou . burton indicated that ferc would need to order between $ 3 and $ 4 b in generator refunds before the state would finalize a socal bail - out . of that amount , socal would most likely be infused with $ 1 b , however , without substantial contributions from power providers that sold into california and currently fall outside ferc ' s jurisdiction ( i . e . bc hydro & la dwp ) , a $ 3 to $ 5 b refund would be impossible to achieve . regardless of legislators ' desires , sources believe that consistent with the pg & e bankruptcy advisor ' s view , a multibillion dollar refund from ferc is unlikely . sources will continue to monitor and report on these negotiations .",0

under your programs create a t directory (t for testing) and add a

But now I prescribe my patients a natural alternative with no side effects . It safely reduces cholesterol absorption by 40% or more, clinical tests show. Ask your doctor if he's heard about it yet, because drugs like Lipitor®, Zocor®, Crestor® and the other statins can cause a whole new set of problems . In fact... The most common question on our Customer Care Hotline is, "" Will I be able to discontinue taking statins? "" Yes, many patients get their prescriptions cut or even discontinued after just a few months. So ask your doctor to let you try this new safe, natural alternative . It really works. But please follow your doctor's advice, and don't stop taking any prescription until you get your physician's okay . Sincerely, Dr Arlene Donar Medical Director CholesterolWatchers >",1

say ""locks chain and returned record"", not
""and returns record""

dear mike
i would like to apply for the above position as advertised in "" earthworks "" and
enclose my full cv ( in word 97 / 00 format ) in support .
i am currently a research fellow with ucl conducting research , and building
forecasting models for the statistical prediction of north atlantic sea
surface
temperatures and other climatic parameters at long leads ( 1 - 12 months ahead of
forecast period ) .
i have recently applied this model to the north sea in order to aid long - lead
forecasts of fish stocks ( see sap - symposium , 4 - 6 december , bergen , norway ) ,
and
have recently been applying similar models to the north atlantic oscillation ,
an
atmospheric phenomena which is strongly correlated with winter climate over
uk / norway and nw europe , particularly temperatures , rainfall and windspeeds
( see
enclosed poster which was presented recently at an international conference on
the nao in vigo , spain )
as you will see from my cv , i have 2 + years experience consulting in several
areas of geoscience to the oil , gas and minerals industries and have good
programming skills , both on unix machines and on pcs .
i am particularly keen to apply my skills in the commercial sector and
initiate
a permanent career path .
i look forward to the opportunity of hopefully discussing my skills further
with
you in the near future .
yours sincerely
tony hamilton

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",0

in good faith,"- - hello , i am mrs . juliet kerr from maldrid , presently
staying in united kingdom . i am married to mr . wilson kerr who worked as the
financial director united nation development on africa for more than thirty
years before he died in the year 2002 . we were married for thirty years
without a child . he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days . before his death we were both christians . since his death i decided not
to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the bible is
against . when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 16 . 8 million
pounds sterling ( sixteen million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling )
with one security company in my name . presently , this money is still with
the security company in europe . recently , my doctor told me that i would not
last long due to cancer problem . the one that disturbs me most is my stroke
sickness . having known my condition i decided to keep this fund in the
security company in europe . i want an organization or an individual that
will use this fund for orphanages , widows and helping the destitudes . i took
this decision because i don \ ' t have any child that will inherit this money
and my husband relatives are not christians and i don \ ' t want my husband \ ' s
efforts to be used by wicked people . i don \ ' t want a situation where this
money will be used in an ungodly way . this is why i am taking this decision .
i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going . i don \ ' t need any
telephone communication in this regard because of my ill health hence the
presence of my husband \ ' s relatives around me always . i don \ ' t want them to

we have been trying to get something arranged for this friday . ubs has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the houstonian a few weeks ago . it is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from mike hutchins before making any arrangements . informally , i have spoken with jillian ' s and sambuca regarding availability for a friday afternoon event . however , absent using yours or greg ' s credit card , we will need approval through ubs prior to booking any formal event .

re : please help,"to clarify :
1 . the guarantee issue is already in play with the canadian pipelines , power pools , office landlords , etc . and will be an impediment to closing and / or commencing business operations ;
2 . it is not that counterparties will be unlikely to transact with this new ubsw canadian entity without credit support . . . they will not ;
3 . although parental g ' ee of ubs ag as credit support will help , the structure of a non - creditworthy sub supported by a parental g ' ee ( with its own terms , conditions and limits ) is the old enron structure , and it may well not be well received in the industry .

canada appears to be an issue .
we need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the us the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be ubs ag , london division but ubs warburg energy ( canada ) ltd . with the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from ubs , this is going to be an issue .
there are two main points , because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers .
please let me know how we can progress on this .

It was very cold, but drops of sweat stood on his forehead as if he were in the hayfield. He was alone, but his lips moved from time to time, and once he called out in some loud, stifled exclamation which resounded hollowly in the vault-like place. He was there a long time.

rubbish claim aerobacter:,"Weight is a major problem everywhere.  Many people battle the bulge every day and hope that they will find a diet that works for them.  However, you don't need a fad diet to lose weight.  You don't need expensive gym memberships either.  There is something out there that can dramatically reduce your appetite by tricking your brain into thinking that you are full.

http://www.asilz.com/

People eat for lots of different reasons, hunger isn't the only one.  There are many reasons why people resort to food as a comforter but old habits die hard.  What if I were to tell you that there is a simple way to lose weight?  A way that, the television favourite, Oprah herself claims to work!  Want to know what she recommends?

http://www.asilz.com/

Cosmetic surgeries and diets are quick and easy ways out but they also have side effects that can't be avoided, not only that but the bills from surgeries are astronomical!  Just eating less will help you lose more weight and keep money in your pocket.  Harder said than done?  Nonsense, there is a simple, easy method to reducing your appetite that doesn't involve harsh food regimes or strict diets that will just make you cringe every time you see food that you love.

ferc gives guardian favorable preliminary determination,"ferc gives high sign to wi pipe competition
the northern illinois and southeastern wisconsin gas transportation
markets , which long have been dominated by
anr pipeline , moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline - on - pipeline
competition yesterday when ferc awarded
the proposed guardian pipeline llc a favorable preliminary
determination on non - environmental issues .
the decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline
because not only did it shoot down most of the
arguments presented by anr to thwart the project , but it found that
even though the project would "" adversely
affect "" landowner interests , guardian was making "" reasonable efforts ""
to mitigate the impact on landowners .
moreover , ferc ruled that while the $ 224 million pipeline would compete
head - to - head with anr , it would not
have a negative affect on the coastal pipeline and its customers . "" on
balance , the commission finds that the
proposed guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits
with minimal adverse impacts , "" the order said
[ cpo 0 - 36 ] .
the commission also found that sufficient need was established for the
36 - inch , 140 - mile pipeline that would
transport 750 , 000 dth / d of gas from the chicago hub to markets in
northern illinois and southern wisconsin ,
providing customers there with an alternative to anr and access to
competitive canadian gas supplies . it would
terminate near ixonia , wi , where it would interconnect with wisconsin
gas co . ' s distribution system . at the
chicago hub , the pipeline proposes to interconnect to alliance
pipeline , northern border pipeline , midwestern gas
pipeline and natural gas pipeline co . of america .
guardian has executed 10 - year precedent agreements with four shippers
for 702 , 500 dth / d , which equals about
94 % of the project ' s design capacity . the largest shipper by far will
be wisconsin gas , which has committed itself
to 650 , 000 dth / d of the capacity on the proposed line . in fact , the
guardian project is an outgrowth of wisconsin
gas ' s request for proposals ( rfp ) process in june 1998 , which the ldc
initiated in anticipation of the expiration of
its firm transportation contract with anr in october 2003 . the other
shippers on guardian include alliant energy
( 10 , 000 dth / d ) , wps energy services inc . ( 2 , 500 dth / d ) and an unnamed
shipper ( 40 , 000 dth / d ) . the project has a
targeted in - service date of nov . 1 , 2002 .
in multiple protests filed at the commission , anr argued that
guardian ' s application was "" patently deficient ""
because it didn ' t include the proposed lateral that wisconsin gas plans
to build to interconnect with guardian .
wisconsin gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to
build the lateral . furthermore , anr claimed
wisconsin gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised ldc serving
southern wisconsin to subsidize the
guardian project . wisconsin gas ' s parent , wicor inc . , is one of the
sponsors of guardian . the other backers are
cms gas transmission and storage and viking gas transmission .
but ferc rejected both arguments . "" while previous attempts to inject
competition into anr ' s market in this area
have failed , we believe that this area is ripe for competition , and
that it is only a matter of time before other
pipelines submit similar proposals to the commission . we find that the
proposed project will provide southeastern
wisconsin with access to another source of supply , which will allow
this market to enjoy the benefits of
pipeline - to - pipeline competition for the first time , "" the order noted .",0

testing depending on perl in Samba 3?,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'd like to port across the test system in Samba 4 to Samba 3. The
Samba 4 test system has a couple of advantages over the one currently
in Samba 3:

 * Support for testing domain members (winbind could be tested)
 * Progress indication
 * Ability to run individual tests rather than the whole bunch

However, it would be necessary to depend on perl in Samba 3 for 'make
test' to run. Is that a problem?

Cheers,

[Ip-health] Merck Press Release on Brazil CL,"http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/corporate/2007_0504.html

Merck & Co., Inc. Statement on Brazilian Government's Decision To Issue
Compulsory License for STOCRIN

WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J., May 4, 2007 - Merck & Co., Inc. issued the
following statement today on the Government of Brazil's decision to
issue a compulsory license for STOCRIN (efavirenz):

""Merck is profoundly disappointed by the decision of the Government of
Brazil (GOB) to issue a compulsory license for STOCRIN (efavirenz),
which would break Merck & Co., Inc.'s patent and make it possible for
efavirenz to be produced by a generic manufacturer.

""Merck has attempted to negotiate in good faith with the GOB, but a fair
offer on STOCRIN has been rejected. While we remain flexible and
committed to exploring a mutually acceptable agreement with the
Brazilian government to help the country achieve its objective of
universal access to treatment, we believe their action is not in the
best interests of patients in Brazil and around the world.

""Merck continues to share with the GOB the common objective of improving
the health and welfare of those living with HIV/AIDS. In fact, Merck's
global HIV pricing policy offers Brazil access to both STOCRIN and
CRIXIVAN® at the lowest price of any country with a comparable wealth
and disease burden.

""This expropriation of intellectual property sends a chilling signal to
research-based companies about the attractiveness of undertaking risky
research on diseases that affect the developing world, potentially
hurting patients who may require new and innovative life-saving therapies.

""Research and development-based pharmaceutical companies like Merck
simply cannot sustain a situation in which the developed countries alone
are expected to bear the cost for essential drugs in both
least-developed countries and emerging markets. As such, we believe it
is essential to price our medicines according to a country's level of
development and HIV burden, thereby ensuring equitable access as well as
our ability to invest in future innovative medicines. As the world's
12th largest economy, Brazil has a greater capacity to pay for HIV
medicines than countries that are poorer or harder hit by the disease.

""This decision by the GOB will have a negative impact on Brazil's
reputation as an industrialized country seeking to attract inward
investment, and thus its ability to build world-class research and
development.

""Merck hopes the government of Brazil will reconsider its stance in the
interests of HIV patients around the world.""

 What is HGH Life?

 HGH Life is our patented formula of Human Growth Hormone, amino acids,
and the most-potent growth factors, all in one pill. It was designed with
anti-aging in mind, and has been noted for increased energy and alertness,
stronger muscles and bones, better looking skin, increased libido and overall
beneficial health benefits in America and abroad for the last several years.

How does HGH Life work?

HGH Life supplements the ever decreasing amount of growth hormone secreted
by the pituitary gland as we get older. The result is youthful feeling
and appearance, increased energy, memory and metabolism, stronger immune
system function, increased tissue repair, cell replacement, and bone strength,
and healthier skin, nails and teeth. In other words, it creates an overall,
more youthful you!

"Re: [R] ""R is not a validated software package..","I've been on vacation and so come late to this interesting discussion.  Let
me add two minor points.

  1. I have run into a lot of statements that ""x is required"" when dealing
with pharma, and in particular wrt NDAs (new drug application).  Almost all
were false.  But I also understand a bit of where they are coming from.  An
NDA costs millions, with the required trials, and is a huge submission in
terms of the sheer amount of paper.  If a company's last NDA was successful,
there is a lot of draw to make the next one as much like it as possible, down
to the font size and the margins.  
  So  I agree with Frank that ""SAS is validated"" is a false requirement, yet
remain somewhat sympathetic to the person who said it.

  2. We have been audited once on a portion of an analysis.  The official said,
more or less, ""show us how you got that answer"" while pointing at a part of
the report.  That particular analysis happened to be done in SAS, but what
was important was our ability to quickly find the relevant code, not the
package.  

  3. If the other party is stubborn about SAS vs S, I have one example I like
to argue with.  The S survival code has an extensive test suite, including
a set of small examples where I have worked out the correct results by hand.
Many of these latter are documented in the appendix of the Therneau and
Grambsch book.  The SAS phreg procedure does not pass all the tests.  (Cox
model + Efron approx for ties + deviance residuals for one.  The size of
the error is numerically insignificant, a 1/n vs 1/(n-1) type of thing: but
it leads to slightly different robust standard errors).

Because there can be more than one logo with different meanings.
As you know, the Debian Project has currently two logos[1]:

 * the Open Use Logo, which should represent the Debian Project and
   Debian distributions, without implying endorsement;

 * the Official Use Logo, which should represent endorsement by the
   Debian Project;

What we are currently doing is trying hard to clarify these things while
making these logos comply with the DFSG.
The main purpose of the trademark license we are trying to draft is
granting enough trademark permissions to make the logos DFSG-free (once
they will also be licensed under the Expat, as far as copyright is
concerned).
However, we need to keep a distinction between the two logos: one
implies endorsement, while the other does not.

I thought this was clear... but maybe it wasn't, or otherwise I don't
understand your objection.

How so?

Well, not really *anything*.  I thought we were fine-tuning the
trademark license, just to carefully define what is allowed and what is
not...
Otherwise, the Debian Project could just avoid holding trademark rights
and all this discussion would be moot.


I must confess that now I'm a little puzzled.   :-/

flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl,"saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy

new enrononline functionality,"the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "" fill order "" . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "" no auto inactivate when stack manager is down "" .
changes regarding suspension of products
stack manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases :
? market close - if a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending . in order to keep a product ' s stack active past the set trading hours , the trader should choose "" keep awake "" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page .
? auto suspend now inactivates stack - on a product with the auto suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product , the product ' s stack will be inactivated if the suspend at level is reached . this feature can be used by checking the enable box on the product properties page under the auto suspend section .
? logging out of stack manager - when you log out of stack manager without inactivating or suspending your products , the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them .

what door or window did I leave open this time?,"A debian system I had running was very badly hacked.  This was debian 
speakup 2.6.18 kernel.  I decided to write a cs script to run clamscan and 
found a really easy way to write that script and was planning on sharing 
that technique until I had a listen of part of the log file I had the 
script make for me.  Then it was time to preserve what I could and erase 
partitions and install a new system.  I'm most interested in what door or 
window I had left open for this hack to have happened.  Activity on the 
system was downloading podcasts which were preserved and also doing some 
ssh connections but sshd_config and ssh_config had been modified to not 
listen on any port; permit root login was disabled, and X11-forwarding was 
also turned off.
What follows is the part of the log I preserved:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unpacker process 11675 stopped due to exceeded limits
//usr/share/doc/lg/108/misc/laundrette/laundrette-108.txt: HTML.Phishing.Bank-1 FOUND

//usr/share/doc/lg/issue85/misc/mahoney/c.img.gz: GZip.ExceededFileSize FOUND
//usr/share/doc/lg/issue86/TWDT.txt.gz: Exploit.IFrame.Gen FOUND

Beyond that, here's a copy of cs script used with clamscan:
#!/bin/bash
# file: cs - clamscan script
clamscan -l clamscan`date -I`.log -r --bell --exclude=/dev --exclude=/proc --exclude=/pts --exclude=/tmp -i --detect-broken --block-encrypted --block-max --max-files=500 --max-space=10M --max-recursion=8 --max-ratio=250 --max-mail-recursion=8 --max-dir-recursion=15 --deb=/usr/bin/dpkg-deb / *

How I found that script so easy to write was I put each command line 
option on its own line after clamscan and when the several lines had all 
of those options I used the join command in ex to join those lines into 
the clamscan command you find in that script.

Even with fixed nc this is Distinctly Non-trivial. It often isn't

I've encountered this problem in air pollution source apportionment, where 
people use an algorithm due to Paatero (1999) JCGS 8:854-8, which is a 
conjugate gradient algorithm that handles the constraints by creative 
abuse of preconditioning.  The algorithm seems fairly well-behaved, 
although the statistical properties of the estimates are not 
well-understood [at least, I don't understand them, and I have simulations 
that appear to contradict the views of people who claim to understand 
them].

The difficulty probably depends on the size of the problem -- the air 
pollution problems have n~1000, p~20, nc~7, or larger.

so the scoop is he is average .
he recently moved out of bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into continental power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks . is it a problem with the business or him ?
he worked for marcello romano ( head of bandwidth trading in europe ) as john knows . marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge . if marcello were to run uk gas again he wouldn ' t take him - as he is not sharp . so he wouldn ' t bother to move him across the atlantic if it costs a lot .
your call . ring marcello for more information .

Since luminance contrasts are necessary and sufficient for readable text, 
you could use white for dark colors and black for light colors.

Luminance is roughly proportional to  0.2*(R^2.4)+0.6*(G^2.4), suggesting 
something like

lightdark= 0.2, ""#000060"", ""#FFFFA0"")
}

This uses a pale yellow for dark backgrounds and a dark blue for light 
backgrounds, and it seems to work reasonably well.

interactive open season ready for testing,"the latest changes to the interactive open season application have been moved
into production and are ready for testing . these modifications include :
displaying the actual bids along with the evaluated bids on each of the
detail lines . this will allow shippers to see the actual bid rate for all
bids greater than max rate .
calculating the winning bids based on evaluated bid and term only ( ignore
time entered ) . a "" * "" in the first column now means that the bid is a
potential winner , not an actual winner .
forcing shippers to bid on the full volume of the package .
the modifications do not include :
allowing users to supersede any of their own bids greater than or equal to
max rate . because this modification introduces a high risk factor , it will
be made after fiday ' s ios .
because some of these modifications affect the way in which bids are ranked ,

No. It means that works licensed under the GPL are considered free
software under the DFSG. That does *not* mean that ""anything in the
GPL is DFSG free"" outside the context of a work licensed under the
GPL.

It especially doesn't mean that one can construct a new license using
selected clauses from the GPL and have those clauses in a different
context be automatically ""DFSG free"".

A work is free by the DFSG only by considering the entire context of
the terms placed upon it.

re : lng may 19 decision,"john ,
this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .
1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash
and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island
project ( please , see point 2 ) .
2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest
( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island
transaction . the next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .
a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :
a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term
contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .
the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the
long - term
contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are
setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .
b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension
option of
5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we
have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for
such a long tenor . this is
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread
and
i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .
one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the
first
5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .
c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market .
d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island
deal
( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .
long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail
that
correlates very well with brent .

vince
i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .
anyway with greg moving to his
new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the
eastern hemishere plus lng .
i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for
lng and lng ship values . i also understand
that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far
away ) . anway i understand this
is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you
please let me know where you stand now ?
i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .

fyi - attached is a complaint filed by care on april 16 against bc hydro , powerex , mirant and bpa ( with the ladwp thrown in as an unnamed respondent ) . the complaint is principally directed against bc hydro and powerex . it essentially accuses bc hydro and powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in bc and transmission capacity reserved by powerex on the bpa system to cob and nob to withhold power during a period of peak demand "" to contrive a shortage and test their market power . "" care accuses bc hydro and powerex of violating section 206 of the fpa , state and federal anti - trust laws , the civil rights of californians under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 and nafta .
the complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts . the evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the yahoo message board by an unnamed power trader in spokane ( we think it is an avista trader ) , selected transmission data from the iso , the la times article of april 11 , 2001 regarding the iso ' s report on powerex , bpa and ladwp , the iso report itself , and bc hydro ' s residential rate schedule . care requests ferc to initiate an investigation , seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want ferc to have the secretary of doe declare an emergency under section 202 ( c ) of the fpa and compel deliveries of electricity .
ferc has noticed the complaint and has established may 8 as the due date for interventions and responses .

my system earlier was hacked,"I wouldn't have thought so except that web access attempts on my local 
system were being redirected to http://noaccess.verizon.net.  Now the 
interesting thing about the page I was redirected to is that the hackers 
must have cut spelling class regularly; they spelled technical techincal. 
There is no way verizon with its professional employees and its good image

mistake on it like that. In any case the system has been reinstalled and 
is shortly about to be backed up to another hard drive.  If that ever

we want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on friday ( although i take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here ) . bear in mind umbrella had agreed to these terms and mark m and lance were to run them passed top gun . presuming they did , seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actualy be ( lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen umbrella ' s term sheet last week ) .
the covering memo should be explicit in asking the ee to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms , they would sign them . the wording needs to be tight and regardless of it ' s enforceability make above clear . in other words let ' s make it look as binding as we can .
if we really can ' t do above let ' s say so and we can look at plan b . john , it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa jan 10 . however let ' s wait and see if we can get one more draft done for weds .

Yes, you are right that ICC depends on assumed data distribution. While ICC is
very handy in linear models it is not the case in GLMM. I suggest you take a
look at the references bellow. There is also some online material by the same
authors. Additionally, I remember that there were lively discussions about ICC

Correct. What is the benefit of using mem_ctx?

Volker told me a couple of days ago that the using the
array as parent context for talloc'ing entries is the
most natural thing.

Maybe using mem_ctx, when the heirarchy is not needed,
is more obvious that it the argument is treated as a talloc 
context? (in this case I _know_ I have talloced the array,
so i can safely use it as a talloc contecxt). What else? 
Is it better (with respect to the administrative efforts) 
to keep the hierarchy flat?

Any enlightenment appreciated!

re : weather course,"vince ,
i ' ve distributed the info on the course . gary taylor , the head of marketing
said that there were perhaps two people he ' d like to send , and he thought
that the teachers would be able to benefit from having people from the
weather derivatives desk in attendance , but that the price of $ 1100 a person
was too steep . gary ( being the head of marketing that he is ) would like to
see if there would be some special deal that could be arranged for people
from the weather desk , but he doesn ' t want to cross the line .

enron is fine ( although i think we have to pay for the hyatt anyway ) .
good discount ( i have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the
weather desk ' s idea is probably different ? ) : for the one day , $ 1100 per
person . if you think that there will be around 10 people or more , then we
can offer a day rate , regardless of the number of people .
thanks vince

enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course . i think that they would be interested if they got a good discount .

we just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather derivatives course ( all from enron ) so far . we have a couple more
that have expressed strong interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . if no one else signs up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the first day pretty easily , and thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at
enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
large side ) ? we would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . we
can teach both days as well , but thought you may want to save some time .
i just wanted to give you some time to think about it . we will know where
we stand on final numbers by next wednesday .

"Re: [R] How to compare linear models with intercept and those
	withoutintercept using minimizing adjs R^2 strategy","One issue is whether you want your estimators to be based on central
moments (covariances) or on non-central moments.  Removing the intercept
changes the statistics from central to non-central moments.  The
adjusted R2, by which I think you mean Fisher's adjusted R2, is based on
central moments (ratio of unbiased estimators of variances---central
moments).  So if you remove the intercept, you must re-derive the
adjusted R2 for non-central moments --- you can't just plug in the
number of independent variables as zero.

Subject: [R] How to compare linear models with intercept and those
withoutintercept using minimizing adjs R^2 strategy

Dear R-list,

I apologize for my many emails but I think I know how to desctribe my
problem differently and more clearly.

My question is how to compare linear models with intercept and those
without intercept using maximizing adjusted R^2 strategy.

Now I do it like the following:

> library(leaps)
> n=20
> x=matrix(rnorm(n*3),ncol=3)
> b=c(1,2,0)
> intercept=1
> y=x%*%b+rnorm(n,0,1)+intercept
>
> var.selection=leaps(cbind(rep(1,n),x),y,int=F,method=""adjr2"")
> ##### Choose the model with maximum adjr2 
> var.selection$which[var.selection$adjr2==max(var.selection$adjr2),]
    1     2     3     4
 TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE


Actually, I use the definition of R-square in which the model is without
a intercept term.

Is what I am doing is correct?

Thanks for any suggestion or correction.

The process is inexpensive and distributed, but it is not ""costless"".

Consumers pay for their distribution costs when they pay their ISPs
(usually a flat subscription rate). Hosting sites must also make money
in some way, in order to pay for equipment costs. This can be quite
reasonable, but is not ""costless"".

There are two classes of ways to do this commercially -- various
subscription/fee based schemes (costs charged directly to downloader)
and various advertising-based schemes (costs covered by related
activities which benefit from the same communications channels).

One of the reasons why it is better not to use ""non-commercial"" licenses
is because they rule out both methods for hosting nodes to make any
revenue from the distribution process, which means that these
distributed costs can't be covered.

Cheers,
Terry

will have to check with risk . this is risk books , a specialist division of

the publication was in a book , entitled "" credit derivatives : applications for

hello vasant !
bijoya has updated me on the discussion you have been having on the article
from risk magazine about credit .
we have found that the attachments you sent her are actually not
word - for - word the same as the published version we have - the changes are
only minor , wever , and have not altered the article in any way .
my question now concerns the copyrights . since the version you sent is
slightly different , do you think this gives us the freedom to publish it
without the consent of risk ?
and if not - can you tell me if it was published by risk uk or risk in the
states ? and which issue was it ? i just want to have all of the details if i
need to call someone at the magazine . . .
also - was there a lawyer involved in the publication procedure , or was this
handled by london / houston pr ? or by vince himself ?
sorry about all of the questions . . . i just want to avoid problems well in
advance .
thank you !

It sounds like your substr is returning undef at some point in the
first file.  If this is not an error then try changing the loop to

while (defined(my $ifile_line = )) {
    my $hits = substr($ifile_line, 0, 6);
    next unless defined $hits;
    push @id_hits, $hits;
}

Also, you should never use a straight string in a regex; it should
aways be quoted.

$line = shift @log until $line =~ /\Q$prime_id\E/;

assistance,"from : ahmed seiko
email : ahmed _ se @ arabtop . net
dubai - uae
dear friend ,
i am ahmed from zaire , presently known as democratic republic of congo . i am
the son of late maramotto sese seiko , the former central bank governor , during
the regime of his immediate senior brother , late president mobutu sese seiko of zaire , republic of congo . i got your contact from chambers of commerce and industry here
in dubai .
as a result of my discrete search for a reliable foreign partner , i am delighted
to confront you based on a profile conviction about your experience in
investment programmed . i now decided to write you as well as to let you know that i need your assistance in helping me to invest my money .
in fact , i left my country with a reasonable amount of money , which belongs to
my late father during the time of war in my country when the present government ,
controlled by president laurent kabila , who sent my uncle away from the
presidential seat , and my father was shot by the rebels , i managed to leave the
country with the sum of ( us . $ 14 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) fourteen million dollars , which is
with me here in dubai , in cash as well . hoping you will respond to my call to assist me in investing this money , because i am totally ignorant of investment and i was in
school when the war broke out in my country .
for your assistance and co - operation , i have decided to bequeath to you , 15 % of
the total sum involved and 5 % mapped out for any miscellaneous expenses that we
may incur during the process of transferring this money to your country .
moreover , it is risk free in the sense that i have taken proper care of all the
formalities regarding to this transaction . i am presently 26 years of age and
should not be expected to withdraw this fund from the security firm where it was
deposited for safekeeping till i am convinced that you can accommodate the
money .
the bottom line is that we need to meet here in dubai to arrange on
the relocation of the funds to your country . items on the things i want are :
1 . helping me to bank the money in a safe account .
2 . help me to get residential papers and giving me directions as to what to
invest on .
please reply me on this email address ( ahmed _ se @ arabtop . net ) as soon as you receive my message to enable me finalize with the security
company , where i deposited it for safekeeping .

[R] weibplot (Weibull plot) for R,"Hello,

The following script allows for Weibull plots using R. 

Its output is similar to the output of the wblplot function (or weibplot function) in MATLAB.

As opposed to the previously mentioned function it does not require proprietary software. Instead, it is based on R.

My code also allows for a graphical visualization of  weibull fitted data. In particular, data can be represented by a straight line in a so-called Weibull plot. According to my observations this is the most common way of analyzing Weibull distributed data (e.g. time to breakdown values, tensile strength values, metal fatigue). 

Here comes my code:

management conference - business unit panel,"hello all ,
i ' m planning the agenda for this year ' s management conference . i ' ve been working on the upcoming meeting since march , but as you can imagine , the direction has changed several times .
we are delighted to have general norman schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership , and gary hamel returning to help us process the past year . while we have arranged an all - star line up of outside speakers , we also want to focus on what is happening inside enron . rather than having only one or two business presentations , mark frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate .
currently , the panel is scheduled to take place 8 : 00 - 9 : 30 am on friday , november 16 . please plan to present a very high level overview of your business . you are welcome to use powerpoint slides , but in the interest of time , presentations must be no more than 10 minutes . mark will introduce each of you , interject questions , encourage interaction , and ensure we stay on time .
below is the proposed order for your presentations . regardless of your place in the rundown , you will need to be seated on stage by 7 : 50 am and equipped with a microphone . because we have a full agenda that morning , we will try to begin the session promptly at 8 : 00 am .
stan horton - global services
louise kitchen - americas
john sherriff - europe
mike mcconnell - global markets
jeff mcmahon - industrial markets
janet dietrich - retail
if you elect to use a powerpoint presentation , please forward it to me electronically by friday , november 9 or provide the presentation to me on cd at the management conference . to ensure consistancy , i ' ve attached a powerpoint template that i would like you to use .
finally , mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4 : 00 pm on wednesday , november 14 following your arrival at the management conference . the meeting will take place in the library off the main lobby of the westin la cantera . in the meantime , if you have any questions or need any assistance , please contact me . i look forward to working with you .

t often cause more casualties than the types of attacks used previously.

The car bomb attack occurred about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in the village of Abu Saydah in the vola=

 to hospitals in nearby Muqdadiyah and the main Shiite district of Sadr City in Baghdad.

 of the wounded were having difficulty breathing and had their sight affected. But officia=

One man had a white cloth across his eyes as he lay in his hospital bed; others were bandaged f=

Abu Saydah is a mainly Shiite village about 25 miles northeast of the Sunni insurgent stron=

as referenced in the iep legislative report sent out by us last evening ,
senator joe dunn took up the report by his senate select committee to
investigate market manipulation on the senate floor moments ago today
( 07 / 21 / 2001 ) . his procedural purpose was to have the report referred to the
senate rules committee . his statement was that , "" enron continues to remain
out of compliance with the committee "" and that this report details the
entire committee ' s procedures in requesting internal documents from enron as
well as its reasoning for sanctions against enron , as listed in the last
paragraph of the report . there was no objection to the report heard on the
floor and the report was referred to the senate rules committee for further
action .",0

Re: [R] levelplot and unequal cell sizes,"Hadley and Deepayan,

Thank you for responding.  Here is a simple example of what I'm talking
about.  It is a grid that is 5 cells wide by 2 cells tall.  The width of
the cells in the x-direction is variable; the cells at either end have
width = 4 units, and the three cells in the middle have width = 2 units.
My objective is to have the color contour boundaries fall on the cell
boundaries instead of equidistant between cell nodes.  In the plot, I
want the cyan/blue and orange/gray boundaries to be located at the red
cell boundary lines.  Also, the colored regions should extend to the
ends of the domain (x = 0, 14).

"[R] shoudl I use apply, sapply, etc instead of a ""for loop""?","I have been trying to learn the various ""apply"" functions but am still learning their appropriate use.  I appreciate any help the R community can offer me.  Sorry for the length of this post.

Background:

I have data on my hard drive organized in the following manner:

The data pertains to many different ""samples"" of data. (e.g. sample 001, sample, 002, sample 003, etc.)

Each ""sample"" contains many different ""data frames"" for a large number of different data-items. 
(e.g. sat score, median income of zip-code, gender, GPA, etc)

The data frames and files are each named with the data-item name as the ""prefix"" of the name and the ""sample number"" as the suffix of the name.
e.g. sat.001, income.001, sat.002, income.002

Each data frame has approximately 5,000 rows, 1 for each ""person"".

Note: The files are somehat large, and most of my analysis will be completed within each ""sample"" .  (Thus, I think that I should probably keep the files stored as separate files, and not combine them into a larger list or data frames. I also do not think I want to load all the files for multiple samples at once, as this mayy take up too much memory.)  Also, I have similar simplified description of the files; many contain multiple columns of data.


###############
I have written a ""for"" loop that does the following:

a. For each ""sample period"" I load two files.
b. I perform a function on the data contain din these two files.
c. I take the results and save them as a new file.
I proceed to the next sample.

Is there a ""better"" (i.e. more elegant and/or efficient) way to do this, perhaps with one of the ""apply"" functions? (e.g. apply, sapply, lapply, tapply?)

#e.g. my simplified code

#this creates example data:
sat.001=c(500,400,750)
sat.002=c(245,455,767)

income.001=c(5020,4200,7250)
income.002=c(2425,4525,7627)

filenames=c('sat.001', 'sat.002', 'income.001', 'income.002')
sapply(filenames,function(x) { save( list=x , file = paste(x ,'.r', sep ='')  ) })
rm(sat.001,sat.002,income.001,income.002,filenames)
ls() #
##############
#my for loop

divide = function(x,y) {x/y} 
#creates a custom function


#inputs to my loop:
samplenames=c('001','002')
x.name='sat'
y.name='income'
fun='divide'

for (i in 1:length(samplenames) ) {

x.name.suf = paste(x.name,samplenames[i],sep='.') 
#name of x file on hrd drive

y.name.suf = paste(y.name,samplenames[i],sep='.') 
#name of y file on hrd drive

x=get(load(file = paste(x.name.suf ,'r', sep ='.')  , envir = .GlobalEnv) ) 
#loads and gets the x file

y=get(load(file = paste(y.name.suf ,'r', sep ='.')  , envir = .GlobalEnv) ) 
#loads and gets the y file

temp=get(fun)(x,y) 
#applies custom function specified in arguments above
# to data  contained in x and y files

save( list='temp' , file = paste(fun,x.name ,y.name,samplenames[i],sep='.') ) 
#save the results in files with name that specifies 
#name of function, name of x, name of y, and sample number
#files will be used for later analysis

rm(list=paste(x.name.suf , sep ='.'))
rm(list=paste(y.name.suf , sep ='.'))
rm(x.name.suf,y.name.suf,x,y,temp)
}

rm(divide,samplenames,x.name,y.name,fun,i)
ls()

Hi Sune,

You raised a interesting point., maybe we should use desktop-base as a
transitional package moving its actual content to desktop-artwork (or
debian-desktop-art) and preparing a new desktop-mountscripts (or
debian-desktop-mount), to make sure we don't break Etch->Lenny
upgrades it could like:

Package: desktop-base
Depends: debian-desktop-art, debian-desktop-mount
Description: common files for the Debian Desktop (transitional package)

desktop-base content: none.
debian-desktop-art: desktop-base as we've in Etch.
debian-desktop-mount: 'mount scripts' as pointed out previously to
cover 'auto mount known partitions'.

Thoughts?

Anatrim  The latest and most delighting lose flesh product is now easily available  As could be seen on BBC.

Can you remember all the situations when you asked yourself to do any thing for being saved from this fastly growing number of kilos? Fortunately, now no great price is to be paid. Thanks to Anatrim, the ground-breaking pound-melting medley, you can get naturally health life style and a really slender figure. Have a look at what our customers say!

""Its quite difficult to confess but I was a junk food addict. 

I swallowed up all this rubbish 

and could not stop. 

This misery ceased when I started taking Anatrim! 

God,

 my craving for food vanished, 

mood increased and Im the happiest person 19 pounds in 2.1 months. 

I can tell you now Im the happiest person!""
 

Linda F., Washington

 
""Since the very childhood I was a weighty boy. 

Its pretty hard to imagine how I detested being derided at school. 

I abhorred my stoutness and I detested even myself. 

After trying this and that I heard about Anatrim. 

This stuff literally dragged me out of this dreadful nightmare! The greatest respect to you, fellows.""

 
Steve Burbon, Washington

 
""Do you know what? Thanks to Anatrim my marriage was happily saved! I got into this circle, depression  eating more  just more depression. My wife was about to leave the overweight psycho I was turning in. 

One of my friends showed me web page and I asked for my pack of Anatrim as soon as it was possible. 

The results were magnficent, my appetite became normal, I was in good spirits oftener, and, be sure, I became able to tighten my belt on some holes. And you see, the bed became cool also!""
