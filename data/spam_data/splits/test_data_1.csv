I guess there is no guarantee that the half hash you get from GIT will
me always greater then the previous one. So in this case it is probably
more advisable to add the date. The version is useful only if ti gives
you a way to guess where in time it has been taken. A random hash makes
it only unique but it is not otherwise useful imo.

[R] Question regarding the mvtnorm R package,"Hi,

I am trying to compare two methods for the calculation of a trivariate normal cdf:

1) ""direct"" - using the original covariance matrix
2) ""indirect"" -  transforming the integration interval using the Mahalanobis transformation and then integrating as a standard random variable.

The following code demonstrates the two methods.

Unfortunately, I get different results.

Am I missing something?

Thanks in advance.

[R] nlme fixed effects specification,"dear R experts:

sorry, I have to ask this again.  I know that the answer is in section
7.2 of ""S Programming,"" but I don't have the book (and I plan to buy
the next edition---which I hope will be titled S/R programming ;-) ).

I believe the following yields a standard fixed-effects estimation:

fixed.effects = as.factor( as.integer( runif(100)*10 ) )
y=rnorm(100); x=rnorm(100);
print(summary(lm( Y ~ X + fe)))

I would like to know how to get the same coefficient on X using nlme.
(I cannot use this ordinary lm method in my real application, simply
because I have 10,000 fixed effects.)  I tried a variety of arguments
to the ""fixed"" nlme parameter (e.g., fixed=list(fmid)), but did not
get the syntax right.  could someone please tell me the magic spell?

may I also suggest that such an example be added to the nlme examples
documentation, too, please?

help appreciated.

regards,

One way:  assuming your data.frame is 'jon'

aggregate(jon[,2], list(jon[,1]), function(x)
levels(x)[which.max(table(x))])
  Group.1     x

The exact syntax you list there won't work, but in any case, changing 
the environment of a function in a package is a bad idea -- it may need 
to reference things from the namespace of the package.

Gabor answered this:  it will go away automatically.

Re: [R] Problem with workspace loading after languageR use,"Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8BIT

Thank you for the example: it has enabled me to test a more comprehensive 
fix for R-patched (soon to be 2.5.1).

You should have got a warning when saving along the lines of

Warning message:
'package:languageR' may not be available when loading in: save(list = 
ls(envir = .GlobalEnv, all.names = TRUE), file = outfile,

The problem is indeed in package languageR, which is creating classes and 
methods in your workspace rather than in its package.  It really should 
not be doing so (it uses setMethod in .First.lib), and I am Cc:ing the 
maintainer in the hope that he will stop doing so.

I also find it hard to believe that

Depends: R (>= 2.4.0), methods, lattice, Matrix, coda, lme4, zipfR, 
cluster, e1071, Design, Hmisc, MASS, rpart

is totally necessary, and suggest that Suggests: is used.

Thanks for the patch for 3.0.25.  If the extensions are to be
dropped, it would have to be in 3.0.26.

Please see my response of a few minutes ago to a similar question  
from Andy Spieherty.  Can you answer the same sort of questions I  
asked in that email?  Also, can you send the output of 'prove -v' on  
the failing test?

Thank you very much.

News update: Dhanoa Minerals Receives Equity Financing Commitment From Institutional Investors for Additional $2.3 Million,"To view this email as a web page, go here. The Bull Report June 7th, 2007 Dhanoa Minerals Receives Equity Financing Commitment From Institutional Investors for Additional $2.3 Million Financing to Complete Acquisition of Its Three Bella Rica Mines and New Central Processing and Refinery Facility TORONTO, ONTARIO--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 7, 2007 -- Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (OTC BB: DHNA.OB - News )(Frankfurt: D7Z.F - News ) is pleased to announce that the company has received a financing commitment for $2.3 million. The financing will be used to complete the purchase of the company's three gold and silver mines located in Southern Ecuador as well as continue efforts to modernize mine operations. The three mines (Bonanza, Guanache, and Mollopongo) are believed to contain 850,000 ounces of gold and over 4 million ounces of silver. The company will dedicate $1.3 million of the new equity financing to complete the acquisition of the mines. Dhanoa Minerals will have satisfied all of the cash obligations pursuant to the acquisition and will have officially acquired its 80% interest in the three Bella Rica mines. This will give Dhanoa Minerals full ownership of the revenue generated from all gold and silver production at these properties. Upon closing, the company will also realize ownership of an additional 2,100 ounces of gold and 10,000 ounces of silver in reserves, which has a current market value of over $1.5 million. The remaining monies for the equity financing will be used to complete the recently announced acquisition of the ""Spanish Plant"", a new central processing and refining facility, as well as continue other modernization efforts to increase production. ""This equity financing commitment is the realization of our acquisition of these tremendously resource rich properties and represents a significant milestone for our company. Today is a very exciting day for our shareholders. Today Dhanoa Minerals has become a major force in gold and silver production in southern Ecuador,"" stated Lee Balak, President of Dhanoa Minerals. The Company: Dhanoa Minerals Ltd. (OTCBB: DHNA) is a newly incorporated naturalresource exploration company.

These are gold producing mines and Dhanoa plans to increase production byupgrading extraction operations. Dhanoa is targeting production in its first year (ending June 2008) at approximately 100,000 ounces. At recent gold prices of approximately $680 per ounce, the value of 2008 production may approach $68 million.  In addition, the Company expects to double production the following year to approximately 250,000 ounces worth around $170 million at today's prices.

How do we set the debug level for the logging of the activities?

When I run my activity, there are plenty of python errors (not my personal
logging) that I don't receive in the log.
For example, if there is an undeclared variable, the activity just stops but
doesn't say why. Is there way of getting those errors in the log file?

[R] Method dispatch in functions?,"Hi,

Could someone point me in the right direction for documentation on the following question? 

Let's say I have two objects a and b of classes A and B, respectively.
Now let's say I write a function foo that does something similar to 
objects of type A and B. Basically I want to overload the function
in C++ talk, so if I give foo and object of type A something (and this
is my question) dispatches the call to, say, foo.A, and if I give foo
and object of type B something dispatches the call to, say, foo.B.

I want to write foo.A and foo.B. How to I perform the method 
dispatch? From what I understand there are two ways in R:
S3 and S4. What is the simple S3 way?

Thanks!

Jack.

[R] How to do clustering,"Dear List,

I have another question to bother you about how to do clustering.
My data consists of 49 columns (49 variables) and 238804 rows.
I would like to do hierarchical clustering (unsupervised clustering
and PCA). So far I tried pvclust (www.is.titech.ac.jp/~shimo/prog/*pvclust*
/)
but I always had the problem like for R like ""cannot allocate the memory"".

I am curious about what else packages can perform the clustering analysis
while memory efficient.

Meanwhile, is there any way that I can extract the features of each cluster.

In other words, I would like to identify which are responsible for
classifying these
variables (samples).

Thanks a lot!

Sincerely,

Alex

treat as urgent please . from ibra balah .,"good day ,
you may be surprised to received this letter from me because you do not know me in person , i am mr ibra balah , the first and only son of late dr funtai balah , who was murdered in the on going sudan crisis in darfur region , i decided to contact you . before the death of my father , he had deposit the sum of us $ 7 , 200 , 000 ( seven million two hundred thousand us dollars ) , in a private security and finance company .
this amount was meant for the purchase of chemicals and tractors for the development of our new farms in darfur area zone . unatics in the society lot of people have been killed because of this war crisis , demanded an end to chronic economic marginalization and sought power - sharing within the arab - ruled sudanese state . which my father is one of them . you can hook up to cnn or bbc news every day for what is happening in the country , if you are in doubt , internet view for more details . it is against this backdrop that my family and i who are currently in dakar senegal decided to transfer our fathers money to any foreign account since the senegal law prohibits refugees ( asylum seekers ) to operate any type of bank account or to be involved in any huge financial transaction .
as the eldest child of my father , i am seeking for a genuine foreign partner who can help us transfer this money in to his or her oversea account . on the other hand , as a honest person whom i will entrust my future and that of my entire family in his or her hands , i must let you know that this business is completely 100 % risk - free .
as we cannot accept to venture into any dangerous deal with our fortune , if you therefore accept to assist us , which i know that you will . please i will like you to contact me through the receipt of this mail urgently . feel free to ask all questions you deem necessary .
for you assistance , we have proposed two options for you . 1 ) you may go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country . 2 ) if you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you 10 % of the sum while the remaining 80 % will be my family prior for investment in your country , while the remaining 10 % will be used to defray all the expenses that may incur during the process of this transaction . you are therefore required of absolute confidentiality of this matter . god bless you .
yours truly ,
mr ibra balah .",1

re : hi !,"hey ! good to hear from you . yes , it is sad about randa but we are all
thinking about her and praying for her . i hope she found a job by now - i
think she was laid off during lq lay offs ! her husband is still working
her , so that is good at least one of them still has a job at least .
meghan - i forgot her name already ! i bet she is a cutie . i just saw my
niece in colorado springs - it was her 3 rd birthday this past sunday so i
got to celebrate it with her . we had a party for her and i don ' t think i
saw so many 2 and 3 year olds in my life ! they kept wanting to eat
something - anything . are kids always that hungry ? it was hilarious . i
can ' t believe she is talking in complete sentences either . i ' m shocked at
how time really flies by . yes , it seems just like yesterday she was born .
i think that is neat that kellyn ( my niece ) and meghan are close in age .
i ' ll have to be sure to remember that !
no huge vacations for us . . my husband and i bought a house in magnolia may
2000 - 1 month before i got laid off - so all our money has been going into
the house for the past year . i bet you didn ' t know about it because i don ' t
think they gave me a chance to say goodbye to anyone when they let us go .
i ' m wondering , did you even know i got laid off ? i can ' t remember anymore .
its been such a long time . besides the colorado trip i just took , we are
going to connecticut next week for my husband ' s family reunion , so it will
be nice to be in cool weather again . how about you guys ? are you still the
jetsetters of houston ?
i know we probably won ' t see each other but marilyn and i talk about you
once in a while and how much fun and interesting you were . if ever you are
in the neighborhood , please give us a call and we would love to see you ,
okay ? take care .

Hi Andrew,

now we need to reset a lot more stuff than cred->nt_hash in
cli_credentials_set_username(), cli_credentials_set_principal()
and cli_credentials_set_password()...so that make test passes again:-)

     I was thinking of things like:

#!/bin/bash
lynx -d %1 > %1.html
for ( link in %1.links.deny ) do }
cat %1.html | sed 's/%link//g' > %1.temp
mv %1.temp %1.html
} done
lynx %1.html

     Yeah, my scripting sux after five years, but I'd use something like
the above to filter out all the google links I don't feel like wading
through.  Just need to keep a copy of links I wand sed to remove in a
file called, ""www.google.com.links.deny"".  Ain't that a mouthful. I've been wanting to use that script ever since I started using
Win-Eyes and had no choice but to tab through each and every link to get
to the edit box.  Yeah, there's probably a quicker way with the browse
mode keys, but I don't plan to keep using Windows...or anything else I
have little or no control over.
     Anyway, it sounds like the only place I found that sells the
DoubleTalk LT is no longer displaying it for sale.  Either that or
they're temporarily out of stock.  Story of my life, trying to get this
stinker running.  Can't believe I've been at it since  January...

What it does not support as yet is translucent colours, and that is a 
restriction imposed by Windows (translucency support was introduced for 
Windows XP, and we still try to support older versions of Windows, unlike 
the MacOS people).  I have been working on a workaround, so translucency 
support is likely to be implemented in R 2.6.0 for users of XP or later.

Given that neither of the two main screen devices and neither of the 
standard print devices support translucency, the subject line looks 
correct to me: the problem surely lies in the assumptions made in ggplot2.

If this license requires restrictions additional to those in the GPL,
then it is GPL-incompatible and cannot be redistributed under either
license.

This restriction is additional to the GPL. The result is
GPL-incompatible and cannot be redistributed under either license.

GPL-incompatible and cannot be redistributed under either license.

This quite clearly is not compatible with the GPL: both licenses
require that the work be distributed only under their terms, thus both
cannot be simultaneously satisfied.

> Is this DFSG-free?

Worse, I don't think the work can be legally redistributed at all.

Any of the problems noted above in the text of the Paul Hsieh
Exposition License make the combined work unredistributable, since one
cannot satisfy both of GPL and the Paul Hsieh Exposition License
simultaneously.

I didn't think of unregistered marks. Yes, in that case it
gets more tricky. This is a mostly-US problem; the other
jurisdictions I know of simply do not recognize trademark
rights unless registered.

TINLA but I don't think that is necessary. Since the license
is ""do whatever you want as long as it doesn't confuse people
with us"", you simply argue differently when you think there
is confusion.

For the open use logo, you would say there is confusion only
when people try to indicate endorsement by Debian.

For the official use logo you would say there is confusion
also when people pretend whatever they have is Official Debian.

Yes, these are vague criteria but that is to a certain extent
inherent in trademark law. You don't know what people will do
and how that can affect your trademark.

I don't know what you mean by that. 

The wording with X and Z seems to suggest that you mean that
X can only be a trademark for Z (""representing Z""). So there
can only be confusion when people use X representing Z, right?

Now suppose three years from now X also becomes known to
represent T. With your license, can you still argue that
X is being misused when people use it to represent T, falsely
pretending affiliation with X? I'm not sure, because the license
says that X only represents Z.

> I'd rather avoid the latter, even at the cost of risking the former!

I understand that. It's difficult to allow other people to do
things with your trademark, because it is easy to permit too much
and that can kill your trademark. It's not like copyright where
a too-liberal license means someone can use it in a way you don't
like; there you still have your free original.

	lib/replace","Author: derrell
Date: 2007-05-10 01:27:18 +0000 (Thu, 10 May 2007)
New Revision: 22772

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=22772

Log:

- Still working on the fact that readahead() is not declared (on at least one
  OS) but is available for linking.  Instead of running configure tests with
  -Werror-implicit-function-declaration in developer mode (which may lead to
  different library functions being used in developer mode than when not in
  developer mode), add tests for whether readahead is declared.  If not,
  provide a replacement declaration in lib/replace.

i have a number of case studies on enron but not the one on sutton bridge .
i know that peter tufano was working on it but when i checked the hbs
site and tried to purchase it , i could not locate it .
when i talked to peter a few months ago , he told me that the case study was
ready
and he was going through enron ' s internal approvals .
i cc mark palmer on it . maybe he knows about this specific case study .
i wander if it was completed , given sutton bridge developments .

I apologize for the off-topic post, but my Google search did not turn  
up much and I thought people on this list my have knowledge of this.   
I am looking for examples of  data brushing  (i.e. dynmaic linked  
plots) either on a web site, or in a web-based application, such as  
an AJAX app.  Even better if there is a way to do this in R.

Thanks for any help.

Re: [R] update packages with R on Vista: error,"Actually the packages R wants to update are: VR, cluster, lattice, mgcv,
nlme and rcompgen. I did how described in the R-Win-FAQ create a
.Renviron File containing the path to the win-library that R already
created (R_LIBS=C: ... ). I also tried to add R_LIBS= as Rgui parameter
from within Tinn-R. Additionally I tried to leave a file named
Renviron.site in the etc library. Nothing worked thus far.

Interestingly installing packages does work fine even without specifying
the R_LIBS path manually with any of the above mentioned methods.

Even more puzzling is that even when I install eg. nlme manually via
install.packages(""nlme"") it works but R still wants to update it. Even
though e.g. library(nlme), ?nlme shows that the latest version is
installed.

I would guess there is some problem with the library path variable in
the update program...

svn version parrot segfault,"I have found a way to segfault parrot. (I know that the following code is incorrect):

pancake@~/prg/parrot$ cat hello.pasm 
main:
        set I0, 3
        set I1, 2
        get_results ""(0)"", I0
        set_args ""(0,0)"", P0, I1
fakesub:
        get_params ""(0,0)"", I0, I1
        add I0, I0, I1
        set_returns ""(0)"", I0
        returncc
pancake@~/prg/parrot$ parrot hello.pasm 
Segmentation fault

The segfault can be avoided by changing:
        set_args ""(0,0)"", P0, I1
 for
        set_args ""(0,0)"", I0, I1

It only happens with 'P', not fot 'S' or 'I'. ://


I have been able to use subroutines in .pir and it works,
but there is any subroutine example for pasm?

-------------------------------------
.sub main :main
        set I0, 3
        set I1, 2
        get_results ""(0)"", I0
        set_args ""(0,0)"", I0, I1
        find_global P5, ""foo""
        invokecc P5
        print I0
        print ""\n""
.end

.sub foo
        get_params ""(0,0)"", I0, I1
        print I0
        print "" + ""
        print I1
        print "" = ""

Ok, it seems like we've got some confusion when it comes to netmasks with
standard dhcp query addresses. The log snipit he posted said nothing
at all about the netmask, and no, 255.255.255.255 isn't the netmask
he's using, (never mind the fact it isn't a netmask to begin with, at
least not for a class c address).

You might want to look at the rsync command rather than rolling your
own.

thanks for looking into this , and for your quick response . i ' m not sure which databases you ' re looking at ( possibly east real time ? ) , but i ' ve attached a list of the four databases the new portland real time traders need access to . the traders names are : darin presto ; john c . anderson ; michael mier . of course , their need for a lotus notes account is implicit in this request . beyond that , they need the following :
title - wscc outages
server - ectpdx - lnl / ect
filename - mail \ wsccnet . nsf
title - west realtime
server - ectpdx - lnl / ect
filename - mail \ westreal . nsf
title - west power scheduling archive
server - ecthou _ lnl / ect
filename - power \ powrschdiarchive . nsf
title - west power scheduling discussion
server - ecthou _ lnl / ect
filename - power \ powrschdi . nsf
again , thank you for your help with this , and please let me know if there ' s anything i can do to help .
thanks ,

there are two databases which i cannot locate :
west realtime
wscc outages
however , i did locate :
real time operations : ectpdx - lnl / ect \ realtime \ myaccoun . nsf ( would this be the correct database ? )
realtime : ecthou - ln 7 / ect \ mail \ realtime . nsf
for wscc outages and west realtime databases , if you could locate someone who does have access to these databases and ask them to do the following :
close the database icon
right - click on the database icon
choose file , database , properties
then send me the title , server , and filename information . this will be of great help .
many thanks and please advise .

Would the following syntax suffice?

    method isValidPostalCode(str $postalcode) returns bool {...}
    =PURPOSE  Check weather the postal code confirms to the standards
    =ARG $postalcode
        a string with blanks trimmed.
    =RETURN
        the string is not cleaned-up.

Because you can already do precisely that in the current design of Pod 6.

And having done it, the current Pod::Parser will extract all of that
information (including the source code), preserving the sequential and
hierarchical relationships, and present you with an internal object
representation that your documentation tool can then analyze and
convert to whatever content and layout you prefer (including
non-semantic Pod that you can then feed into any of a dozen
back-ends).

samba4 tp4 tar ball broken (kind of...),"Hi,

trying to untar the samba4 tp4 tar ball on a AIX machine was 
impossible without installing GNU tar. The problem is that there are 
path names >= 100 characters and GNU tar by default uses it's own 
proprietary extension to allow this instead of using the pax or 
ustar tar format.

The result looks like this:
...
x samba-4.0.0tp4/webapps/qooxdoo-0.6.3-sdk/frontend/framework/source/resource/icon/crystalsvg/22/folde, 1499 bytes, 3 media blocks.

Recent GNU tar implementations support long path names 
without using proprietary hacks by using the --format=pax or the 
--format=ustar switch. I think this should be used by default for 
making official Samba tar balls, what do you think?

hello,"from : mr albert williams .
chief auditor ministrie
of finance economics
cotonou - benin republic .
address : 01 bp 1234 , cotonou - benin republique
please send your reply to : chiefauditor @ pop . co . th
dear sir / madam ,
it is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues . i have decided to seek a confidential co - operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties , and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business .
i am mr albert williams chief auditor ministrie of finance economics cotonou - benin republic . i got your information when i was searching for a reliable , honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with . i was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the web site . i wish to transfer the sum of $ 14 , 300 , 000 . 00 usd ( fourteen million three hundred thousand united states dollars only . ) into your personal or company ` s bank account .
this fund was a residue of the over invoiced industrial contract bills awarded by ministrie of finance economics cotonou - benin republic to some foreign firms . this deal was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed off . as the chief auditor , i have the cooperation and mandate of the financial director and the secretary . it was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of west africa . this is borne out of our beleive in the non - stable and sporous political nature of this sub - region .
the original contractors have been duely paid by the banque centrale des etats de l ` afrique de l ` ouest ( central bank of the west african states ) this balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice . i intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities . based on the laws and ethics of employment , we as civil servants working under this organisation , are not allowed to operate a foreign account . this is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise , assistance and partnership in your country .
it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here . the assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies . more often than not , big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution .
i have however agreed , as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40 % of the entire sum as compensation , why 55 % will be held on trust for me while 5 % will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any , during the course of the transactions . this transaction will be successfully concluded within 5 - 7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation . you should provide the followings .
1 . your bank name and address
2 . your private and confidential telephone
3 . name to be used as beneficiary
4 . your bank telephone and fax number
5 . or you can within the shortest possible time , confidentially open an entire new ( virgin ) account for the transaction . i would prefer this arrangement .
upon the receipt of this informations , the certificate of job completion of one of the contracts will be issued in your for the transfering of the fund to your nominated account without delay . as with the case of all organised ( sensitive ) and conspired deals , we solicit for our unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business . we hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable business life afterwards . there are no risks involved .
well , this is the sharing ratio of this $ 14 . 3 m for both of us : -
1 ) i want you to know that my 55 % from this fund $ 14 . 3 m is : $ 7 , 865 , 000 : 00 .
2 ) while your own 40 % from this fund $ 14 . 3 m is : $ 5 , 720 , 000 : 00 .
3 ) while 5 % from this fund $ 14 . 3 m for any expenses made by you and me is : $ 715 , 000 : 00 .
reply asap .
with regards .

eol data mining,"vince ,
here are four graphs i came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of
interest :
the first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different
counterparties -
( note the large part that aquila plays ! )
the other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week
between the hours of 8 : 00 am and 4 : 00 pm for different categories of product .
natural gas and power have their own graphs , as they have the largest traded
volumes . "" products "" is for the remaining categories .
there are still some things i would like to take a look at . the databeacon
software is now available , and can be reached at the following url :
do you have any specific questions that you would like me to try answering
regarding eol ?
i have also started doing some research on automated trading platforms . are
there any websites and / or papers you would recommend i read ?
thanks ,

re : additional controls - residual assets,"louise : i agree with your assessment that this project will essentially be managing the legal risk that accompanies these residual interests . since 99 % of these interests resulted from deal guys trying to salvage value from troubled assets that never paid out , i initially thought that lydecker ' s assessment of any potential value would be helpful . as you point out , however , this is step 2 of the process with step 1 being compilation of the list which my group can handle alone . i will let you know when we get the list together . thanks for your input ! rick c .

subject : re : additional controls - residual assets
i don ' t quite understand the need for dick ' s group - all we need now is a complete list of everything and then we can decide what to do with it . there will be items which fall under many different groups . these are assets which are probably best managed from a legal perspective as essentially all we are managing is the ongoing legal risk .
i really forsee getting the list and making mark haedicke responsible for them on a long term basis .
tried to call you to discuss . let ' s talk later - of course you can use dick ' s group if you think appropriate - i just think this is probably a legal risk issue .

cc : rick buy / enron @ enronxgate
subject : additional controls - residual assets
louise : i spoke with rick buy yesterday about improving our monitoring controls over potential assets that we might own due to some residual claim or "" clawback "" that enron retained when the primary asset was disposed , i . e . midwest gas storage . while we don ' t have hundreds of these situations , i am aware of several deals where we retained overriding royalties , exploration options , calls on cash flow after certain debt is paid off , etc . hopefully , most of these have been captured in our compliance system but as illustrated with midwest , our system does not appear airtight .
therefore , i propose that we immediately review all of our current and disposed portfolio for any "" hidden "" assets or claims that have not been properly captured . additionally , we will shore up our monitoring procedures where necessary . one of our deliverables will be to provide you and other members of senior management with a list and description of potential assets .
in addition to rac , i would like to have participation from the commercial and legal side on our review team and suggest that perhaps dick lydecker ' s group would have the appropriate resources .
i would appreciate your concurrence and feedback at your convenience . regards , rick c .",0

Well, in fact it was very simple.  There's no ""package:grDevices"" in
there.  Now, why that didn't happen before, I'm yet to work out.


Thanks for the suggestions.

This can't be done, because the error happens before f is called.

strictly private .,"gooday ,
with warm heart my friend , i send you my greetings , and i hope this letter meets you in good time .
it will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally . however , i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction , which i propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity . i have kept it to myself for a long time , and now i need to act , as time is not on my side . i want you to open - heartedly read through and give me your most needed support . i got your address from an internet directory , in my search for a contact . i apologize if this is not acceptable to you . the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance .
my name is donald phiri , the farm supervisor and personal assistant to mr . david stevens , a very popular and rich farmer from macheke , zimbabwe . my master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of april 2001 , due to the land dispute and political situation in my country , as a result of my master ' s financial support for the mdc ( movement for democratic change ) , the main opposition party to president mugabe ' s party , zimbabwe african national union patriotic front ( zanu - pf ) . for more information on my master ' s murder , you may check the amnesty international country report on zimbabwe for the year 2001 .
when the pressure on white farmers started in zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by president mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers , my master forsaw the danger ahead , he then closed his major bank accounts , and together , we went to johannesburg , south africa to deposit the sum of $ 14 . 5 million ( fourten million , five hundred thousand usdollars ) , in a private security company , for safety . this money was deposited in a box in my name , as my master was being secretive with his name , as the south african government of thambo mbeki is in support of president mugabe ' s actions . the box is labeled as gemstones . my master had planned to use this money for the purchase of lands , new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in botswana . he has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from europe . my master is divorced , and his wife valerie , and only child , diana have relocated to bradford , !
en !
gland for 9 years now .
i am currently in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum . i have now decided to transfer my master ' s money into an account for security and safety reasons . this is why i am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left . you have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you .
if you accept to assist me , all i want you to do for me , is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the netherlands , and then we will transfer the money into an account . you may open a new account for this purpose . i have applied to the security company to transfer the box from south africa to their branch here , which they have done .
to legally process the claim of the box , i will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative , and deliver the box to you . i have with me , the certificate used to deposit the box , which we will need for claiming the box .
for valuable assistance , i am offering you 10 % ( $ 1 , 450 , 000 ) of the total money . i have also set aside 1 % ( $ 145 , 000 ) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction , and 4 % ( $ 580 , 000 ) , will be given to charity in my master ' s name i will give 25 % ( $ 3 , 625 , 000 ) to valerie and diana , after my share of the money has been transfered back to me . when they grant my asylum application , my share of the money ( 85 % ) , will be transfered back to me , into an account i will solely own . i also intend to start up a business then . if you have knowledge of farming business in your country , or other areas of possible business investment that i may be interested in , please inform me , so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being .
please , i want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction .
i look forward to your reply and co - operation , and i am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you .
yours sincerely ,
donald phiri .

Not really; that is the conventional moment estimator of overdispersion

Whose paper?  It is churlish not to give credit, and unhelpful to your

Overdispersion _exists_:  'all models are wrong but some are useful' 
(G.E.P. Box).  The question is if it is important in your problem, not it 
if is detectable.

There are, but like formal tests for outliers I would not advise using 
them, as you may get misleading inferences before they are significant, 
and they can reject when the inferences from the small model are perfectly 
adequate.

In general, it is a much better idea to expand your models to take account 
of the sorts of departures your anticipate rather than post-hoc test for 
those departures and then if those tests do not fail hope that there is 
little effect on your inferences.

The moment estimator \phi of over-dispersion gives you an indication of 
the likely effects on your inferences: e.g. estimated standard errors are 
proportional to \sqrt(\phi).  Having standard errors which need inflating 
by 40% seems to indicate that the rule you quote is too optimistic (even 
when its estimator is reliable).

realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations . helen and i talked earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and
run the parts separately on different processors , then aggregate the results .
this procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time . looks like
we have to do it this way now . buying a more powerful computer helps but
does not solve the problem .
in addition , we might want to re - consider if writing the code in vb is optimal .
i was assured at the very beginning that vb runs as fast ( if not faster ) as c ,
but some re - assurance from it group on this issue is helpful .
best ,

subject : generation earnings model
hi alex -
danielle and i were talking to david m . today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results . last week we ran calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations . the 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run . to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days . we are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations .
we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using . do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process ?
thanks ,
michelle

No. This is a bug, and the border color can currently only be black or
transparent (but it's easy to find and fix the bug; lpolygon is very
short, so just write a replacement).

However, panel.superpose recognizes and splits certain graphical
parameters; border is not among them, but fill is. So you could do:

my.panel.bands  I often can figure things out on my own, but obviously there's

The concepts are all there in the help page (but it's often difficult
to put them together). The main points are:

(1) unrecognized arguments get passed on to the panel function as is
(2) subscripts give indices of x, y, etc in the original data frame

(the implication being that if you have another column from the
original data frame, such as upper and lower in your example, indexing
by subscripts will give you the matching subset). Other than that, the
panel functions have to do their own work (and what they do should
ideally be documented); nothing is enforced, so nothing is guaranteed.

This sort of thing doesn't get used often enough for examples to be
easily found. The following demo in lattice might be helpful.

file.show(system.file(""demo/intervals.R"", package = ""lattice""))

subject : re : grant masson
dear vince :
?
after a very great deal of thought , i have decided to stick it out with el
paso .
?
please be assured that this exercise was not a "" fishing expedition "" to
extract concessions from el paso . ? rather , it is simply that , although i
continue to harbor doubts about some of el paso ' s methods and about the
people running the business , i have concluded that two months is not enough
time to fully judge the company . ? i feel that i have not yet given el paso
( or myself for that matter ) a fair chance . ? after all , if i disagree with
the way the business is run , i should regard that as an opportunity to
effect changes and not an excuse to run away .
?
please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to all those who worked so
hard over the holidays to produce the offer : david oxley , sheila walton , and
especially norma villarreal .
?
and thanks also to you vince for your patience , humor , and good advice . ? as
i ' ve said before , i consider it an honor to be able to call you a colleague
and friend .
?
with best regards ,

Your not going to believe it at first because neither did I.

They get to stay home everyday, use the phone returning phone calls and actually

Last week thier earnings were in excess of 5k!!

So I was thinking about you and figured you may want to find out more yourself so here is the number.

I really hope you give them a call as I would hate to see you miss out. This is perfect for stay at home moms,

Yes, that's a sign that the PATH is not set the way the R tools need it. 
  See the ""Windows toolset"" section of the Installation and

Hi Scott,

You need some sysadmin experience to do this.

You can build a new binary RPM from the source RPM, which is also
available from CRAN, by typing

rpmbuild --rebuild /path/to/source.rpm

If you do this as root, then the result will be in 
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386, or
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/x86_64
depending on your platform.

You will get an error if you have not installed all the RPM packages
required to build R correctly. Install them. The best way to do this is
to use ""yum"", since it handles dependencies between packages.

It is much more secure to build RPMs as a normal user. You just need to
create a file .rpmmacros in your home directory, with a single entry,
like this:

%_topdir        /home/martyn/mybuild

Then create the same directory structure under the directory ""mybuild""
as you find under /usr/src/redhat.

I hope this helps.

Martyn

John,

   Thanks.  I have been using this program without problem for a while, 
I'd like to say over a year, but I am not sure.

   So, could it be that somehow the environment path variable relating 
to perl had been changed?  Otherwise, I cannot account for the difference.

Thanks,

Kevin

"Proposal: drop libmsrpc.so in Sa,mba 3.0.26","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

* jerry lobs one up for debate

The libmsrpc code in incomplete, suffers from bitrot, and has no
maintainer.  The pain of trying to keep in it the 3.0.26 tree
while moving to the PIDL generated server and client stubs
is unnecessary IMO.

I would like to remove it form SAMBA_3_0_26 and siable it
in the SAMBA_3_0 tree (but leave it in place in case someone
wants to revisit it after the migration to PIDL is finished).

COmments?

louise :
i spoke to texaco today and put forth the following alternatives : ( 1 ) remove randy and put jean in his place ( i did offer to consider paying randy out of his contract ) , ( 2 ) transfer all texaco / enron employees to bridgeline without the ability for them to get paid out and walk away when the texaco / chevron merger occurs .
texaco strongly . . . . no violently . . . . opposes installing jean as president , as they feel that everyone would quit - and no doubt many would . my counter was that many of these people may quit anyway once the texaco merger occurs , so we are in the same spot but with a president that is committed to the company . my personal feeling is that we would also loose a number of the enron folks , but we could recover , and may be better off .
i ' m not sure we have a legal case to force randy out , especially given texaco ' s violent opposition . however , the threat of jean as president seems to have a good deal of motivational power . jack abadie committed to propose the following to texaco in his meeting in nyc next week :
1 . all employees become bridgeline employees now .
2 . texaco employees get paid by texaco their severance as follows : ( half when the merger occurs , the remainder after 12 - 24 months .
3 . if texaco employees leave they loose the unpaid severance .
i am going to develop our legal position to see what leverage we have ( or don ' t have ) . i do have the "" open cost issues "" as a bargaining chip , but would like to drive this to a crisis point before playing that card .
i have a bet with texaco that i can have the bridgeline benefits plan in place by the end of the month . jeannie slone is committed to this goal .
also , i have not yet relayed the texaco conversation with jean and would like to hold off to see how this plays out .

re : dpr summary,"dear david ,
thanks for your message . to make our request clearer , for the past two weeks
we have put out a preliminary dpr every morning at 8 am our time ( seen by
commercial heads , jeff skilling , ken lay , rac , anyone with access to the
dpr ) . all groups world - wide are able to provide us preliminary figures by 7
am our time for :
positions ,
maturity gap ,
var , and
p & l
this is the information that we would like you to provide as well .
i understand that you have some hurdles to get over to be able to provide us
these figures , and while you keep working to get over these hurdles , we would
be happy if you provide us the information you are currently able to ( i . e . if
you can only provide p & l we ' d like to start with that , if you can only
provide us with one commodities information we would like to have that ) .
please remember that the information we are requesting is preliminary
information . we would expect that there would be some changes between what
you give us at 7 am and the final information you give us by 11 am .

subject : dpr summary
shona ,
just to summarise the main thrust of our discussion yesterday :
preliminary p / l due @ lpm local ( 7 pm houston )
as i understand , sally is the sponsor of this project with the goal of
presenting skilling with a dpr by 8 a . m . the following day .
i have asked all mgmrs to assess how we can achieve this . we will discuss
this in meeting early next week .
a major obstacle that we face , is limited it resource to re - engineer and
expedite our processes . this will require buy in of senior mgmt and
commercial business heads to reallocate resources away from current projects .
( james to discuss . )
additionally , there are certain dependencies on depts in houston , which are
prerequisite for dpr completion in london . notably continental power has a
dependency on portcalc it support in houston .
shift work and 16 hour days are more difficult ( not impossible ) to implement
in london as the labour market is very tight and such working conditions
would make enron very uncompetitive as a prospective employer . bear in mind
that we compete directly with all the big investment houses for the best
talent . a decision to use shift ' s would have to be made at the highest level
considering the possible implications on the corporate image . this might
suggest that additional it resource is the only feasible way forward .
i could easily say that we can do the preliminary p / l but i assume that we
wish to retain the qualatitive features of our reporting . therefore i have
tempered my comments to reflect what i believe are real issues that we in
london will have to address . we will get back to you with our proposals . ,
after we have discussed these issues early next week .
same day dpr
this is the long term goal and is such a large project that it would have to
be sponsored at the highest level here in europe .
james to discuss with fernley & mike .

First, if you want speed and your model can be fit by lmer I would
recommend using lmer or lmer2 from the lme4 package.  These functions
can fit models with crossed or partially crossed random effects which
is often the case for models in very large data sets.  However, they
do not provide the facility for specifying correlation structures or
variance functions in addition to those implied by the random effects.

Both lme and lmer end up calling nlminb to do the optimization of the
log-likelihood or the REML criterion.  The lmer2 function does not
call nlminb explicitly but does use the underlying code from nlminb.

None of these operations are easily parallelizable.  The only hope for
getting a speed boost from multiple CPU cores or multiple processors
is by using a multithreaded accelerated BLAS (Basic linear algebra
subroutines) library (see the R Installation and Administration manual
for details).  However, in some cases we have observed that
multithreaded BLAS actually slow down the computation.  To check if
this is the case for you try the following both with and without
multithreaded BLAS.

library(lme4)
data(star, package = ""mlmRev"")
system.time(fm1  In the case if, I would very much appreicate your hint or point to a source

Although I would agree with that, the main matter here is not whether
this WAV file would be appropriate for main or contrib, but whether it
is distributable at all, since the GPLv2 requires complete source code,
which includes ""the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable"".

No, the config file cannot affect the compile. As it's read long 
after the code was compiled.

It's possible to change how a code is compiled by constant and 
subroutine definition/declaration and prototypes and it's also 
possible to change it by ""source filters"".

subject : mhi 501 f ' s sale process - status
brett ,
the following is a status summary on where we are regarding the sale of the first 2 mhi 501 f turbines :
our two most firm candidates right now are :
( i ) fred lange , from rescue 2000 , for a project in california of a company called intercom : his offer for the turbines , the already directed change orders and spare parts was us $ 90 , 230 , 000 . he agreed to make a us $ 200 , 000 payment for a three - week exclusivity upon execution of the relevant ppa , which is expected for today . the ppa execution was postponed for a week ( from last monday until today ) due to regulatory changes in california . therefore , there is no certainty about the ppa being executed today . we will talk to fred lange tomorrow to check where the process is .
( ii ) rick davis , from genassis , for a project in mexico , of a company called empresa industrial rio colorado : his offer for the turbines , the already directed change orders and spare parts was us $ 87 , 000 , 000 . he made his offer willing to make a us $ 2 million exclusivity payment , to be refundable "" if enron does not obtain the assignment of the mhi contract "" . we will call him tomorrow to inform him it is really up to them to qualify as a permitted assignee ( they have a copy of the contract with the permitted assignee conditions ) , and will check his position about making the us $ 2 million payment absolutely non - refundable .
as a back up , we are also talking to a couple of other brokers ( mike edwards - belyea power - and tom young - try ventures - ) , who are running behind the two above mentioned .
the following table shows ( i ) the book value of the different turbines components and ( ii ) the profit enron would make based on the two offers received so far :
base price 67 , 817 , 800
change orders 6 , 752 , 560
spare parts 4 , 900 , 000
approximate financing costs 2 , 800 , 000
total book value 82 , 270 , 360
fred lange rick davis
price offered 90 , 230 , 000 87 , 000 , 000

fw : london work,"hi ,
how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun ,
cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may
day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the
excitement in enron credit .
it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting
loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from
vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems
to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded
email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .
in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in
the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to
mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on
the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""
finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this
duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear -
that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their
exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear ,
read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports ,
because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make
the enron credit personnel too happy .
well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .
thanks ,

subject : london work
hi iris ,
amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work
here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron
credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should
also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of
the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for
duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run
the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also
need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both
amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions ,
but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to
get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have
already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .
hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more
time ?

Hi Karen,

"[SAMBA-SECURITY] CVE-2007-2444: Local SID/Name Translation Failure
 Can Result in User Privilege Elevation","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

==========================================================
==
== Subject:     Local SID/Name translation bug can result
==              in user privilege elevation
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2007-2444
==
== Versions:    Samba 3.0.23d - 3.0.25pre2 (inclusive)
==
== Summary:     A bug in the local SID/Name translation
==              routines may potentially result in a user
==              being able to issue SMB/CIFS protocol
==              operations as root.
==
==========================================================

===========
Description
===========

When translating SIDs to/from names using Samba local
list of user and group accounts, a logic error in the
smbd daemon's internal security stack may result in a
transition to the root user id rather than the non-root
user.  The user is then able to temporarily issue SMB/CIFS
protocol operations as the root user.  This window of
opportunity may allow the attacker to establish additional
means of gaining root access to the server.


==================
Patch Availability
==================

A patch against Samba 3.0.23d/3.0.24 has posted at

  http://www.samba.org/samba/security/


==========
Workaround
==========

There is no immediate workaround for this defect that does
not involve changing the server code in the smbd daemon.
The Samba Team always encourages users to run the latest
stable release as a defense against attacks.  If this
is not immediately possible, administrators should read
the ""Server Security"" documentation found at

  http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html


=======
Credits
=======

This vulnerability was reported to Samba developers by Paul
Griffith and Andrew Hogue.  Much thanks
to Paul and Andrew for their cooperation and patience in the
announcement of this defect.  Thanks also to Samba developers
James Peach and Jeremy Allison for the analysis and resolution
of this issue.

The time line is as follows:

* March 20, 2007: Defect first reported to the security@samba.org
  email alias.
* March 30, 2007: Initial developer response by Gerald Carter.
* April 4, 2007: Patch released to bug reporter for testing.
* April 9, 2007: Fixed confirmed by original reporter.
* May 3, 2007: Announcement to vendor-sec mailing list
* May 14, 2007: Public announcement of the security issue.

"Re: [R] Question of the impact of the pilot experiment on the
 overal statistic interpretation of the subsequent work","Bruce,

Far below you ask for comment on an issue of statistical interpretation 
of a collection of biological experiments.

Your university (judging from your email handle) has one of the best 
statistics departments in the world and some of the best biostatisticians 
in the galaxy.

You would do far better (than posting your query here) to take your issue 
up with one of them.

In a face-to-face meeting with one of them you will get a much better 
analysis and discussion of the issues than you could hope for from a list 
like this, notwithstanding that some statisticians sometimes provide 
thoughtful answers to posts asking for statistical help.

on the 21 st of october 2000 , my client , his wife valerie and their two children ( larry and daren ) died in an auto crash on one of nigerian roads . since then i have made several enquiries to the embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives without success . after several nsuccessful attempts , i decided to look for somebody abroad who is reliable and trustworthy i will forward as next of kin to receive his fund , hence i contacted you . i am contacting you to assist in claiming the money left behind by my client before the bank confiscates or declare the fund unserviceable . until his death , my client had , and maintained a us dollar currency deposit account with a closing balance of us $ 15 . 5 m ( fifteen million , five hundred thousand us dollars ) with the nigeria deposit insurance company who have written us to recover all such dormant and unclaimed accounts to reinvest it with other funds through the capital market , but we have cleverly written and asked them to release the f
und based on the instruction of the next of kin .
it is for the urgency of this claim that i write to you to stand and receive the money as mr . allen ' s next of kin since i have failed in attempts in locating the relatives for over 2 years now . i seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since i have perfectly procure all the vital documents that would aid the release of the money and forward it either to europe or america whereby you will receive the money . i am prepared to disburse the money among ourselves in the following ratio : beneficiary / next of kin 30 % , 10 % for bank and legal expenses , while my colleague and myself in the chambers shall have 60 % .
if this proposal is acceptable to you and you do not intend to take undue advantage of the trust we shall bestow on you , then kindly respond immediately , furnishing me with your confidential telephone and fax numbers . i have all necessary legal documents for the release of the fund . on indicating your willingness , i shall contact you for us to work out the modalities for you to receive the funds . all i require is your honesty and co - operation . i guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law .

regular expressions issue,"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I created a file called data.txt which contains a bunch of junk, including
some IPs. I want $line to be  stored in
$ip .

It works, except for the regular expressions which should find only IPs. If
I use the regular expression with the grep command in terminal I get only
the IPs. Here in Perl I don't get any output.

#!/usr/bin/perl

@input = `cat ~/ip.txt`;

foreach $line (@input){
  if($line =~
/[[:digit:]]\{1,3\}\.[[:digit:]]\{1,3\}\.[[:digit:]]\{1,3\}\.[[:digit:]]\{1,3\}/){
  $ip = $line;
  print $ip;
  }
}

Any ideas? It's breaking my head.

proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all,"affiliates

proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates
federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate .
previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates .
the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to .
commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . "" i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . "" she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . "" i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . ""
wood said he understood "" the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . "" staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . "" if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , "" one staffer responded .
wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , "" but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

pastoria update - revised power asset development dash,"the pastoria dash each of you signed last week has been modified at the request of jeff skilling and rebecca carter . late friday afternoon , west power was advised to value the gas transportation on a pvl 0 rather than var basis . the impact of this change was to increase the cost of the gas transportation from $ 34 mm to $ 102 . 3 mm . the $ 102 . 3 mm is a worst - case scenario in that it assumes none of the capacity can be resold .
also , rac has advised that no new signatures will be required for the revised dash .
the revised dash will be considered by the enron executive committee this afternoon in a special meeting along with other projects .
attached for you convenience are ( 1 ) the original dash ( dash dev final dg . doc ) , ( 2 ) the final dash before the executive committee ( dash _ pastoria 4 _ 030901 ) and ( 3 ) a redlined comparision of the final to the original ( dash _ pastoria 4 _ 0309091 _ redlined ) . most all highlighted changes reflect the substitution pv for var . a few minor changes were also made .

Hash of anonymous hashes,"Hello all,

    I have a hash anonymous hashes.  The data stream that I am getting 
is actually from an SQL query a users ID, like ""jones12a3"", a subsystem 
name associated to that ID, like ""Lotus Notes"", and a number, ""3"" tied 
to the number of subsystems changes that that user has implemented.  so 
that stream comes at me like...

jones12a3, lotusnotes, 3, jones12a3, unix, 4, jones12a3, linux, 13, 
smith18a1, unix, 5, smith, ... etc...

so i use the ID as the key in the first hash, and the value is a new 
anonymous hash whos key is the subsystem name, and value is the number 
of changes...

so i have:
jones12a3 => {lotusnotes => 3 unix => 4 linux => 13}
smith18a1 => {unix => 5}

and so forth..

i have used Data::Dumper to see the actual output and it is as 
expected... but i want to use the data in that anonymous hash and 
iterate through it getting a count and such..

i can't seem to figure out how to get to it once it is in there...

do i dereference it somehow?  they are anonymous hashes, so they have no 
name...

sorry for the lack of real information here but the actual code is at 
work, and i am emailing this from home... but hopefully someone here has 
run into this before... Thanks in advance!

Yes. That's exactly what we've done. Pod 6 has:

=item  a C<=use> directive that allows you to load behaviours for
        any user-defined blocks or formatting code you want

=item  a standard mechanism by which user-defined blocks are available
        (just make the block names mixed-case)

=item  a standard mechanism for adding new formatting codes (the M<> metacode)

Of course not. Indeed it's a *plea* for something more concrete to discuss, a 
suggestion of a way to get past the philosophical impasse of one group saying 
""this does everything you want"", without nailing down the specifics of how, 
whilst another says ""this isn't good enough"", without clearly indicating what 
would be.

What I was actually suggesting was that this design *isn't* set in stone, and 
that the best way to convince Larry that the existing design could be better 
is to actually offer a better design.

sorry for the confusion . attached is revised look at this report . you can now see the approver for each shopping basket created ( note : if approver is blank , the requistioner had authority to approve themselves ) . i have also opened the columns which show the shopping cart line item descriptions and amount . the shopping cart column was showing you the total of the shopping cart with each item in the basket which really is not very helpful . ( i . e . , 3 items ordered for $ 100 , $ 200 and $ 300 respectively all in one shopping basket with the report showing that the shopping basket was $ 600 ) .

i am a bit confused i thought we had agreed to the following last week .
expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved .
issues :
why are there so many repeat lines , each request is issuing 3 times in some cases . will this mean we order three by accident ?
i have no idea what has been ordered - last week i could see this time its all in code . please resend with descriptors .

re : warning - your neurological check up expires february 31 th,"pain relief consumer information newsletter
we offer generic versions of the most popular pain relief drugs .
order hydrocodone directly from fda - approved manufacturers .
save up to 95 % on all your drugs .
please look at the following specials we have :
1 . hydrocodone 500 mg 30 pills only 169 . 99 $
2 . vicodin ( generic ) 750 mg 30 pills only 159 . 99 $
3 . phentermine 37 . 5 mg 30 pills only 89 . 99 $
our full pricelist can be found at : http : / / medsrealcheap . com / abcol . html
what is vicodin used for ?
vicodin is the brand name for the popular painkiller , hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen .
hydrocodone bitartrate is an opioid analgesic and antitussive , occurring as fine , white crystals
or , as a crystalline powder .
in the u . s . there are over 200 products containing hydrocodone , typically combined with acetaminophen
( vicodin , lortab ) . however , it is also combined with aspirin ( lortab asa ) , ibuprofen ( vicoprofen ) ,
and antihistamines ( hycomine ) . both tablet and liquid forms of hydrocodone are available ( tussionex ) .
other brand names include anexsia , cogesic , hydrocet , hy - phen , lorcet , maxidone , norco , panacet , and zydone .
street names for vicodin include vikes and hydros .
our site has more info : http : / / pillsforcheap . com / abcol . html
1 . background :
hydrocodone dates back to the 1920 ' s when knoll , a german pharmaceutical company , believed hydrogenizing
codeine could make it less toxic , making it easier on the stomach . as its name implies , hydrocodone is the
codeine molecule with a hydrogen atom attached . during this time in the u . s . , a disturbing percentage of middle
class americans were hooked on opium derivatives . the government , anxious for a non - addictive painkiller ,
gave extensive funding to research new compounds like hydrocodone .
2 . indications :
vicodin is a phenathrene - derivate opiate agonist , effective both as an antitussive ( anti - cough ) agent , and as
an opiate , an effective analgesic for mild to moderate pain . five mg of hydrocodone is equivalent to 30 mg of
codeine when administered orally . 15 mg ( 1 / 4 gr ) of hydrocodone is considered equivalent to 10 mg ( 1 / 6 gr ) of
morphine . hydrocodone is considered to be like morphine in all respects .
3 . effects :
vicodin is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to
those of codeine . most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle . the precise mechanism of
action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known , although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate
receptors in the central nervous system . in addition to analgesia , narcotics may produce euphoria ; drowsiness ;
lethargy ; relaxation ; difficulty in concentrating ; decreased physical activity in some users and increased physical
activity in others ; mild anxiety or fear , and pupillary constriction .
4 . how can our prices be so low ? :
we ship directly from fda - approved manufacturer in india where the production costs are low .
the branded versions of the product are more expensive because other companies spend a lot on marketing . however ,
our quality is the same as that of the branded drugs . providing quality is where we spend our budget . we don ' t
think that marketing is that important if the product works . besides , there are no middlemen , when you buy directly
from the manufacturer .
all packages are shipped discreetly by airmail worldwide .

Re: [R] Rdonlp2 - an extension library for constrained optimization,"Hello R-list,

I have released an update version (0.3-1) of Rdonlp2.
Some (fatal) bugs which may kill interpreter should be fixed.

In addition, user-visible changes are:
* *.mes, *.pro files are not created if name=NULL(this is default) in donlp2().
* use ""machine-epsilon""s defined in R for internal
calculations(step-size, etc.).
* numeric hessian is now evaluated at the optimum and calculated with
  the algorithm specified in 'difftype' in donlp2.control(). Setting
difftype=2 will
  produce (roughly) same value as optim() does.

I sincerely appreciate users who sent me useful comments.

Windows Binary, OSX Universal Binary, Source file are available at:

[R] Get the difference between two matrices with different length,"Hello,
I have got two matrices with different length. The matrices have 3
columuns. The first two are coordinates. The third is a measurement.

Now I want to get a subtraction between every single value of the 
third column (between matrix1 and matrix2), but only if the two 
first coordinates in matrix1 and matrix2 are the same.

I tried ""FUN=?"" in aggregate and ave, but I don't know the command
for such a subtraction?


Thank's a lot.

I'm not sure what exactly you want. I assume that A and B are not the
observations but the corresponding time stamps, right?

In any case, I guess that the ""zoo"" package will have some useful
functionality for what you want, e.g., if you have data like
  library(""zoo"")
  set.seed(123)

performance management process,"as our existing businesses grow and new businesses are created , ease of
movement and development of our top talent becomes essential to our success .
as you heard at the management conference all officers will be titled ,
reviewed , promoted , and compensated according to a more standard set of
guidelines . the process recognizes the intrinsic value of each officer ,
rather than tying that individual to the value of their specific job or
reporting relationship .
officer titling has been standardized throughout enron . there are four
levels of officers : members of the enron office of the chairman make up level
4 . level 3 includes all other members of the enron executive committee .
level 2 is made up of managing directors , including company presidents and
some senior vice presidents . level 1 are vice presidents and some senior
vice presidents with grandfathered titles .
this year a common evaluation process is being implemented for level 1 and
level 2 officers . officers will be evaluated by a committee , through a
process referred to as the performance review committee ( prc ) , utilizing a
standard set of performance criteria and performance ratings . performance
committee reviews will occur twice a year  ) in july for feedback purposes and
at year - end for feedback as well as bonus and total compensation
considerations . the executive committee will handle the prc for all level 2
officers . review of level 1 officers will occur at the business - unit level
first with the results  & cross calibrated  8 by the executive committee and a
group of approximately sixteen managing directors .
the goals of the prc process is to insure a consistent standard for our
overall pool of executive talent and to provide a tool to more effectively
utilize talent throughout the organization . to further promote consistency
the executive committee will consider all promotions in january of each
year . exceptions , internally or externally , will be infrequent .
the individual  , s performance evaluation will be the starting point for all
compensation decisions . compensation includes base pay , bonus and long - term
awards . a long - term program that replaces individual or business unit plans
has been approved and will be communicated to individuals before bonus
payments are made .
in addition to the level 1 and level 2 reviews , business unit , global and
corporate cross - functional prc reviews for directors , senior directors and
general managers have started . this year - end process will be utilized as a
benchmark to determine how we further refine the evaluation process at this
level in the future .
if you should have any questions about the process , please direct them to
your human resources business unit leads per the following :

DR DANELLE,"Der von dem Unternehmen mit Sitz in Muenchen eteleon (ISIN DE000A0JNF60, WKN A0JNF6) adressierte Handymarkt hat in den letzten Jahren eine nahezu einmalige Dynamik gezeigt. Trotz der bereits erreichten Penetrationsrate besteht auch fuer die Zukunft noch wesentliches Potenzial. 
eteleon kann seit vielen Jahren eine deutlich profitable  und wachsende Geschaeftstaetigkeit in den beiden Geschaeftsbereichen e-Solutions & Products und e-Sales aufweisen. Im Geschaeftsbereich e-Solutions & Products hat sich eteleon auf IT-Vertriebsloesungen und Dienstleistungen für Telekommunikations- und Unterhaltungselektronikprodukte sowie innovative Mobilfunkvertragsprodukte im E-Commerce und Distanzhandel spezialisiert. Der Bereich e-Sales umfasst den Vertrieb von Telekommunikations-Vertragsprodukten und das Bundeling von Konvergenz-/Trendprodukten sowie den Vertrieb eigener Produkte, Cross- und Up-Selling und Vertragsverlaengerungen ueber Distanzhandelswege. 
eteleon vermittelt Vertraege fuer alle Netzbetreiber und ausgewaehlte Service-Provider und bietet eigene Vertragsprodukte und Bundles an. 
Um sich gegen Konkurrenten zu behaupten, setzt eteleon konsequent auf Flexibilitaet und Innovationen. Fuer die Zukunft scheint die Unternehmensstrategie wohl durchdacht und ueberzeugend, erfordert aber zusaetzliche Finanzierungsmittel. Vor dem Hintergrund der bisherigen Unternehmensentwicklung ist die faire IPO-Entwicklung bei 20,4 Mio. Euro zu sehen und die Aktie bis zu einem Preis von 8,00 Euro zur Zeichnung zu empfehlen.

     Also be sure you're using the right ribbon cable.  EIDE drives take 
an 80, and not 40-wire ribbon cable.  the red or marked wire is wire #1 
and usually is closest to the power connector on the drive.  Wire #1 
should be clearly marked on the motherboard or HDD controller card.  You 
may be trying to connect an IDE component to an EIDE component or 
vice-versa.  HTH,

Spotlight Homes Enters Negotiations to Acquire Commercial and Residential Contractor

HOUSTON, TX--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 6, 2007 -- Spotlight Homes, Inc. (Other OTC:SPHM.PK - News), a builder of luxury homes with Green technologies, has entered negotiations to acquire a commercial and residential real estate contractor. 
Nick Jarvis, President and CEO of Spotlight Homes, stated, ""This acquisition would give us an immediate presence on the Eastern Seaboard, and we like this company's track record. Their projects fit nicely with our portfolio and philosophy."" 

The contractor designs and manages projects primarily on the East Coast, with several projects presently under contract. Signing of the definitive purchase agreements is subject to negotiation of the transaction documents. 

At Spotlight Homes, our mission is to build luxury homes in the burgeoning real estate markets of the Southern United States.

UNICEF and Chad agree on demobilizing child soldiers
17 May 2007

Dear Andrew: UNICEF and the Government of Chad have signed an accord to demobilize child soldiers throughout the country. The agreement was signed last week by UNICEF Representative Stephen Adkisson and Chad’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Djidda Moussa Outman. It follows up commitments made by Chad in February at the ‘Free Children from War’ conference, which was held in Paris and organized by UNICEF and the French Government. That conference resulted in the Paris Principles, an agreement to end the use of children in armed forces or groups around the world. The new accord in Chad is seen as an important step toward putting the principles into practice. “It was a strong demonstration of will on the part of the Chadian Government to ensure that all children under the age of 18 will be removed from any kind of military service,” Mr. Adkisson said. Learn more about this landmark agreement. Thank You.

For decades, a conflict between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front has raged in the southern Philippines, leaving many children without access to essential immunization and nutrition services. But under an agreement between UNICEF and the rebel group, fighting was suspended recently so that health workers could carry out a two-week campaign known as ‘Days of Peace’.

"Re: linux, windows and vmware","It's not very difficult to get vmware working, I just did
an install a short while ago. Install the free vmware
server then install a client and the management tool.
They are all installed by script. This is a bit of a bear
to get working on slackware though, for this distro
you need to set up a fake system v init dir tree or the
setup won't run (totally lame install script!), install
pam because vmware wants it and slack doesn't have
it, and I had to change one of the config files related
to pam, but oh well it's slack, I still love my slack lol

One thing I wanted to mention though, I used to run
the old vmware workstation 5 on windows and install
linux on vmware, it worked excellent, performance
was good, even with only 512mb ram in the system.

However, this time I used the new free vmware
server and client setup installed on linux and put
windows on the vmware, it was horribly slow, it
was not usable for my needs. I really don't know
if it's because windows is on vmware (instead of
linux on vmware) or if the new free product just
doesn't perform as well as workstation 5 did.

I just upgraded to 1GB ram so I'll try vmware
again and see if it performs better. The audio
support is horrible on vmware server/client, in
fact its not really supported, and there is only
ONE audio driver, hopefully it works for you, on
my system it works, sort of, sometimes I get
pauses in audio. If I'm not mistaken I think the
vmware server sends audio over a local network
to client, and it's not doing that very well.

If you're going to play with vmware and linux,
set aside lots of time for it, and expect that you
will do some head scratching. It's not difficult
but some things are strange, like it has SCSI
drivers that emulate IDE and there are many
different ways to configure vmware.

The excellent way is setting it up so that you
can either boot directly into each operating
system or run inside a vm. There is a way to
install it this way, by giving the VM access to
the entire disk. There are documents on the
vmware site on how to do this. This way you
have the convenience of booting the guest OS
in a window, or if you need better performance
or true hardware, boot directly into the guest
OS without the VM. I've done it before and
it worked very well.

I may actually buy a newer version of vmware
workstation because I like it much better. It
is one peice of software than I believe is
worth the money.

Re: TTSynth Is Available Again,"Luke said:
While making a tarball would be easy, the person using it would  have to
be sure they had the libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 shared library, which is
 from gcc 2.95. Luckily, Ubuntu/Debian and Fedora still carry this, but I
 doubt very much whether other distros do, and it would certainly not be
 trivial to build it.

Spie adds:
It's not trivial but it is doable. I have in fact done exactly that with the
ibm tts in the past, both on LFS and slackware. It does take some
considerable work, because we're talking raw guts of toolchain here.
There various parts of toolchain of specific version that are known to
work with specific versions of the other parts, like any given gcc will
work with some version of binutils and glibc etc. But I can say it is
doable and satisfying to get it done. It is also an opportunity to use
the knowledge gained in LFS toolchain build to good use. It is even
possible to actually have two different glibc versions on a system.
I wish I would have kept specific notes on what I did, but oh well.
Actually some of my notes may be in the archives of this list, I seem
to recall posting at least some info about what I did to make it work.
After changing distros, kernels, versions, etc so many times I gave
up on ibm tts, but I really do love that product. It's a shame that
ibm gave up on it, I recall an IBM engineer explaining that they
spent millions on it and could not keep doing that for free. I think
however that most of that work was on the recogniton part. The
tts was tiny compared to the recognition engine and it was clear
that their focus was on recognition. They were and are a bit out
of touch because tts has much more direct useful application
while the recognition was not worth it for me, it was cool to
play with but not accurate. It seems they have since shifted their
efforts in two other directions instead of regular old linux, they
focused on speech on embedded systems, and rolled their
speech strategy into websphere, where they make gazillions
of dollars selling to big enterprise. I suppose we should just
be glad that linux work is still available. It was a strange idea
how they did the tts, you could buy it .. or not. It was free
but you could buy it! And they wondered why nobody did.
Still chuckling over that.

fw : timelines and restart issues,"louise ,
i have a bit of an issue with this because the power and gas objectives seem to take a backseat to the eol objectives . for example , bradford said he will not get to my request for my top power counterparties for a couple of weeks because he has a top - 50 eol list that he is working on . there are a lot of counterparties that are important that do not necessarily use eol . eol is an amazing platform , but i dont think eol should be driving the power , gas , legal and credit rampup processes .

re : debt trading losses,"sally , brent and gary ,
in a meeting with bryan , jeff , gary and markus on monday , november 20 th , i
showed bryan a copy of the monthly price verification procedures and the book
administrator ' s price verification comparison spreadsheet . i also showed
brent this information later in the day , as he had to leave before we all
left .
therefore , i find bryan ' s operations ' bullet wrong and misleading . this is
not the statement that was made and agreed to on monday when we all met .
this statement is also not consistent with what is actually in the
attachment . you will receive a copy of the price verifcation spreadsheet for
the last six months on monday .
please call me or theresa with questions .

bryan ,
i think the second bullet is misleading . the bullet is not reflective of
what is actually stated in the attached document .
there is a month - end price verification process on the credit book .
trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing . where the mark is
greater that 2 points , the difference is discussed with the trader . trader
must then amend the mark or provide third party substantiation for the
illiquid position .
the price verifiaction comparison spreadsheet with broker quotes is filed and
maintained by risk management .
the operations break - down in the process relates to :
triplets excluded from the monthly price verification process and not
escalated , prioritized to management
telewest pricing relied on a price from the prime broker which was manually
sourced and not current
price verification comparison results should be formalized and distributed
to senior management .

subject : debt trading losses
we have discovered two positions in the debt trading book which were not
being marked to market . the current mark of the 2 positions results in
approximately $ 4 . 7 million loss . the details are in :
the primary control issues are :
? trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had
not moved over the term of the transactions ( ql ' 00 - nov 15 th )
the losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by
operations . the trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will
implement the steps agreed with operations to ensure that we have a robust
approach to controls for the debt trading book going forward .",0

Abbott cuts price Brazil pays for AIDS drug

Last Updated: 2007-07-04 15:00:33 -0400 (Reuters Health)

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc. said on Wednesday it
will cut the price it charges Brazil for its Kaletra AIDS drug by
29.5 percent as part of a strategy to lower costs for developing
nations.

The lower price for Kaletra, a combination of the drugs lopinavir and
ritonavir, will help Brazil supply free drugs for its globally
recognized AIDS treatment program.

""This accord saves Brazil's program more than $10 million a year and
creates a reserve for more patients with HIV,"" Abbott Vice President
for Latin America Heather Mason said at a press conference in Brasilia.

In May, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva authorized Brazil to
break the patent on an AIDS drug for the first time after price talks
broke down with Merck & Co.",0
follow - up on captive generation,"vince / stinson ,
please find below two attachemnts . the excell spreadsheet shows some
calculations on the savings from using dabhol power as against a diesel
genset operating at a higher heat rate . there is also a differential in
price of diesel , as against naphtha used by the plant . i have taken data
from the septemeber bill of dpc . we do not want to give the actual numbers
to the press , since they ar likely to have a field day with the 6 cent / kwh
energy price of dabhol that is reflected there .
the seond attachement ( word ) has the wordings that i think we can send in to

satisfactory , please forward to jeff / s .

I assume tridge read RFC2222 (where adding 'dn:...' is proposed)
and tried the domain base dn and it worked against w2k...

W2K totally ignores the dn, but w2k3 checks it...

With the patch w2k (plain) and w2k3 (plain) are happy

"folks ,","attached is a conservative ( and fairly rough ) estimate of the size of the
petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged
drought in southern texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and
possible curtailed production . the total annual revenue generated by these
assets is no less than $ 20 b and could be substantially higher as the
estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other
facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable .
note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial
complexes from houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to
experience such a drought - induced interruption . the only facilties
identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers : brazos , colorado ,
navidad , guadalupe , and nueces .

whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable .

re : ubs notes at ferc mtg,"i based the code of conduct on what sam behrends had drafted for
the netco mbr application ; as you suggest , it may be preferable to
use the code that epmi or pge uses . one other thing that we still
need to focus on is the undertaking in footnote 17 of the february
1 draft concerning standards of conduct for the pipelines , or at
least transwestern . .

looks good . i need to find a different version of code of conduct
that
more closely mimics epmi and pge version . the agreement in
appendix b
right now may be too restrictive for our current dealings .
agree that we need to finish up details of ( a ) data transfer and
( b )
transistional services agreement .
in my discussions on friday , the transitional services will be
"" agent "" type
activities . enron needs help in making sure that it can service
its
contracts . no ubs warburg energy employee will make commercial
decisions
for enron - simply perform directed activities .
the question of data transferred is still outstanding , but i will
hopefully
know more on monday am . i am checking on exactly how much
counterparty
info will be held by ubs warburg energy .
i plan on being in your office first thing tues am .

here is what i had come up with . my thought is that the bold
roman
numeral headings would make up an agenda , which we should send
to
cindy marlette on monday , along with a list of those who will
attend for ubs . the subheadings , which would not appear on the
what we send to ferc , would be the main items for discussion .
i don ' t think your approach and mine are very far apart . i
might
be somewhat less affirmative about raising the section 203
issue .
it will surely come up as we describe what will or will not be
transferred .
i also think it would be very helpful to clear up the points
about
the approach to existing enron customers , and the transitional
arrangements before the meeting i would like , in any event , to
put something into the mbr application on transition
arrangements
that is more definitive - - in the right way - - than footnote 12 of
the
draft i sent out yesterday .

lt . gen . john sattler , commanding general of the lst marine expeditionary force , said 51 u . s . troops and eight iraqi security
forces have died in the falluja offensive .
about 1 , 200 insurgents have been killed in the
battle , he said .
although falluja is secured , troops remain busy
conducting mopping up operations and engaging in sporadic fights with holdout
insurgents in the city .
sattler said u . s . and iraqi troops are "" ubiquitous ""
throughout the city .
"" falluja is secure , but we ' re in that
search - and - clear phase which will make it safe , "" he said .
"" we ' ve commenced the clean - up operation "" and
humanitarian assistance is being moved into the town .
about 25 to 30 injured civilians in the city have
been treated for injuries , sattler said , adding that he knows of no civilians
killed in the fighting .
he said more than 1 , 000 suspects have been
captured . some have been released after questioning .
thair al - nakib , a spokesman for interim iraqi prime
minister ayad allawi , said the battle for falluja has been won by u . s . and iraqi
forces and that the city is no longer a terror
stronghold .",1

move forward with the steve announcement the day that dale moves full time to

subject : london research group
john ,
i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group .
as you know , dale surbey , who was managing the london unit of the research
group ,
is moving to ebs . dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of
talent we have currently
in london .
given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston , it ' s time
to nominate one member of the research group for a management position .
my recommendation is steve leppard . steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader ,
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers . steve has a very high energy
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent .
his promotion is likely to cause anjam ' s departure form enron . i value
technical
skills of anjam , but in spite of my loyalty to him , don ' t think he is the
same caliber
as steve . however , i would not like to lose him and think about moving him to
houston
for 2 years . i think that the opportunity to work in houston , would be a
sufficient
incentive to keep him in enron . by the way , his performance feedback has
greatly improved .
please , let me know what you think .

How does Cialis work?,"Content-Type: text/plain;

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

sddp model,"john ,
attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the
developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor
of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is :
www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and
contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls
are possible .
development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare
the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in
central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs
on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc .
while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around
1994 .
the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of
from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power
systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks ,
so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle
thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m
not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the
model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic
dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water
value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a
number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would
operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode
of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model .
most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission
constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine
bus nodal prices .
a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files .
if you ' d like to know more about sddp , you could call me here in houston .

As I mentioned earlier. I did. The exact path as you stated

Although doing 

$ perl -c helom.cgi

works on plain cmdline (with/without ""use lib""). 
But not in through Apache.

Well, many programs still use them by default.  For example, some have 
discussed aumix as a mixer program.  It uses /dev/mixer, which is why it 
doesn't show all controls.  Most programs, including Mplayer still default 
to OSS-compatible operation unless overridden.  So, until this changes, I 
consider the OSS emulation mandatory.  There is the aoss command, which 
tries to make a program that would normally use OSS use ALSA instead, but 
it doesn't always work.

I remember this one...

The first part is because you have some parinoid users who pass the
password on the command line, but don't want the password's length
easily guessed by how many Xs are left in the argv buffer, visible vi
ps, after we process it.  (note the race while we process it is
unprotected).

It would seem to me a reasonable request, except that this information
is probably available by looking at the offset of the next argv buffer.=20

very beneficial and advantageous. Researchers can congregate via
computer networks such as MediaMoo or other MUDs facilitating
the possibilities of cures for the earth s illnesses and human
diseases. With the use of computers and network, doctors and
researchers will be able to work together and tackle the world s
problems. Moreover, sociologists can record, observe, and study
communication networks, allowing the fabrication of invaluable
conclusions and theories. For biologists, computers can produce
artificial life. Computer generated living beings live and
breakthrough will most definitely impact further studies into
reproduction of, for example, micro organisms that are the
foundation for living forms.

is like a tool the
artist has used to create his/her work, just like a camera, or a
tablesaw. With art that exists solely within the computer, the
images can only be viewed via the computer and nowhere else. It
is a permanent attachment to the piece and it is therefore an
different from traditional art or even independant computer
generated art because it's focus or motives are related to
communications in a different way - an area of communications
which is void of the physical and tangible.This difficult concept
of relaying ideas and information can be thought of as a large
base of information, compiled of the thoughts and interests of
a person who conceives ideas and then attempts to communicate
expression will be depends on the the designer. If the designer
is a musician the expression might be a musical score, if the
designer is an architect than probably a building plan. ------=_NextPart_001_000B_01C7A57B.FD257780--

This is because $y didn't get a valid value.

Yes, and lattice came with R, so it is always in the .libPaths().
.libPaths() will tell you the current value, and note that you can only 
add to the default library (or libraries in R >= 2.5.0).

library() will tell you that you cannot use it.

We are in a similar situation and the approach we've used is to keep R
as a backend computation engine (using Rserve) and have a web service
interface to it.

Thus when we develop a predictive model, we dump it on the backend and
have a web service interface to it. With this interface we can then
write a web page client or even include the model into custom code
(command line or GUI).

You can see some examples at:

http://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/rws/ames
http://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/ncidtp/dtp
http://www.chembiogrid.org/cheminfo/pkcell/


The first two use previously built predictive models. The last one is a
piece of R code.

Alternatively you could use RApache

no filters are currently active , and all female employees are at the top .

unfortunately , myself and jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices .

females :

6 cs / st , no eel
males :
10 commercial , 4 eel
6 cs / st , no eel ( primarily have st ) .
i think we need a few additional commercial females , and a few male & female cs candidates to give us a balanced portfolio .
although i think the london office will be closed by the time i get the names to them today , we should have their data by early next week .
also , i have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees marcello romano identified , as well as a few others .

 Basically, if a customer of yours wanted to use pyfoo to create a Python
application using libfoo which is distributed under terms other than the
GPL, that customer of yours would need both a license from you and a license
from the author of libfoo.

 Now, you could enter an agreement with the libfoo author so that you can
sell directly pyfoo+libfoo licenses...

california update 6 / 14 / 01,"executive summary
? bankruptcy fears mount with absent mou or plan b
? california puc wagers the promise of qf payments
? socal ring fencing
? california budget having problems
bankruptcy fears & plan b
sources are becoming more pessimistic regarding the prospects for a state bailout of socal . at this time the negotiations on plan b appear to be in danger of falling apart . the governor ' s efforts to position the legislature to take the blame if socal files ( due to lack of movement on the mou ) and senator burton ' s hostile response that the governor is the one responsible for delays is a sign that sentiment toward working for a bailout may be disappearing . it now appears more likely that a plan b alternative to the mou will not be reached due primarily to a failure to achieve consensus on how to spread the burden of the dedicated rate component . this could likely lead to a socal bankruptcy filing in the foreseeable future and as sources note , parties to the crisis are not optimistic about reaching a deal .
cpuc moves to pay qfs
according to media reports on the cpuc qf payment plan , socal ' s payments to qfs are contingent on the legislatures ' approval of the mou . in a move to publicize their cooperation and facilitate this process , today the cpuc passed three of the four mou provisions set by davis / socal ed negotiations and promised to examine the last provision at their june 28 th meeting . thus , with the cpuc posing no hindrance to stabilizing socal ed . , the legislature will bare the burden of debating the mou or plan b . sources report that if it appears that no legislative solution can be achieved , the qfs could file involuntary bankruptcy against socal . yesterday ' s decision raised the state ' s price cap on the qf ' s substantially , and ought to help increase production . so once again , price caps have kept crucial power generation assets off the market . sources note that the qfs contracts with socal now have cancellation clauses built into them in the event of socal filing involuntarily - this is something the qfs learned from the experience of pg & e ' s filing and judge montali ' s subsequent rulings . the financial question about these payments to qfs is less whether they will in and of themselves bankrupt edison , than it is whether other creditors force edison into bankruptcy rather than see that money leave the building . the sums in question are not huge , an absolute maximum of $ 50 million , but we are told some bondholders may well consider $ 50 million to be a sum worth fighting for .
ring fencing
edison international ( eix ) has issued a $ 1 . 2 billion bond via its mission energy subsidiary , proceeds of which will be used to pay off certain credit lines with banks . sources report that paying off these credit lines will negate cross - default clauses in those lines , and insulate eix from the effects of a bankruptcy at southern california edison . this is exactly what pg & e did a few weeks before filing chapter 11 , and has further convinced a lot of people that the game plan at eix includes letting sce file and restructure in bankruptcy rather than outside of it . sources comment that when judge montali approved large bonuses for pg & e senior management after pg & e ' s filings , it made bryson and members of his team "" reconsider "" the merits of bankruptcy .
california state budget :
day - to - day stress relief notwithstanding , the california state budget is still a shambles . more than $ 8 billion has been paid to power generators , depleting a political treasure chest which was going to be doled out to special interest groups for years to come . the only hope for the state comes from the issuance of $ 12 . 5 billion in "" power bonds . "" financial market participants are still questioning whether the state of california is illegally declaring itself to be a senior creditor of the one ( soon probably two ) bankrupt utilities . by declaring that cpuc rate hikes be directed first to holders of "" power bonds "" rather than general creditors of the utilities , the state is saying that the money they spent buying power "" on behalf of the utilities "" is a senior claim . the state treasurer phil angelides has given repeated assurances that this is so , and will likely do so again in a conference call next tuesday , but concern about this opinion reportedly dampened enthusiasm for a $ 1 billion g . o . bond california issued this week . one highly respected sacramento columnist said this week that the "" power bonds "" are no better than 50 - 50 to get issued at all .",0

yes, static linking of parrot.exe. debugging is much easier with
static parrot, embedding easier with dynamic parrot. it'd be nice to
have the best of both worlds--i won't get into debugging embedded
parrot, that's *supposed* to be difficult ;-)

When I was working with it for one of the Butterfly iterations
(admittedly about 1 1/2 years ago) it was in pretty bad state, with only
1 person working on it IIRC, and nobody could really help me out with
problems.  It's not had that great of a track record.  So unless it's
gotten a lot of love in the past year, it's probably not the right
approach if you need something in the next few months.

It's not a good idea to install all these headers.  We need to
clean up  the code to allow a small set of public headers
that people can build against.

a bit of background.
Last week i emailed debian-desktop list to propose as lenny release goal
to add a task called ""enterprise-desktop"" and also one called
""enterprise-server"", names are not important. I am just giving my
support to this.

I think the majoraty of debian's instalations are in corportive
environments, server And/or desktops. So i think that debian should have
the goal to give those users a better solution than the general one.

My first proposal was to create 2 tasks in tasksel. We have desktop
task, so we could add an enterprise-desktop task.

My point was to provide centralized authentication and information,
having something like libpam-ldap and libpam-mount installed and
configured by debconf's interface.

For -ldap is easy, just now, it just asks for the server, but -mount
would mount server partitions as well as user's desktop preferences.

Also, it would be given care to the tools and packages included.

A cdd would be good for some first testing, but having it included in
debian would be great.

re : list of topn 50 counterparties,"thanks . will talk with you tomorrow . one issue that should be discussed is
the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today . my guess is that
any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
will want to use as well as credit department needs . and so sending out
language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder . this is only a
timing issue i think but is important nonetheless .",0

RE: Trying out Slackware,"This thread has morphed in to discussing ways to convert line endings. 

I think the most portable tool is awk. I just love awk.

In the below one-liners, bns is the Braille 'N speak, or Macintosh; both use
only CR and not LF at the ends of lines:

from Unix to bns
  awk '{ gsub(""\r"", ""\n""); print $0;}' macfile.txt > unixfile.txt

from bns to unix
  awk '{ gsub(""\r"", ""\n""); print $0;}' macfile.txt > unixfile.txt

unix to Windows
  awk '{ sub(""\r$"", """"); print }' winfile.txt > unixfile.txt

windows to unix
  awk 'sub(""$"", ""\r"")' unixfile.txt > winfile.txt

Works in Netbsd, freebsd, Windows, DOS, ultrix, even vms, provided you got
awk.

Do you buy pharmaceuticals online? The US NMA was specifically established to protect the consumer. Our experts check every online shop for bogus medicines. The blacklist of unreliable or simply fraud shops is updated every week. We strongly recommend to visit our site before buying any medical products online. visit us

Our site http://www.us-nma.com/

The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

Please check our blacklist of unreliable and fraud shops before buying any medical products online!!! Protect your family and yourself.

[R] Working with matrix,"Dear,
                    Thanks for your prompt assistant. The problem I posted is just a bit of my problem. The whole problem is that; 
  1. I simulated a multivariate data set X (n by p)
  2. Then draw sample without replacement from X (k less than n)
  3. Compute the eigen values of the variance-covariance matrix of the sample drawn
  4. Store the eigen values in matrix eigenvals
  5. Store the samples(that is the row identifier) drawn in rowvals
  6. Bind the two matrices using rbind.
  The problem is;
  7. Now I want the print out of the maximum values of the eigenvalues product and samples that give such maximum product.
  Thanks

[R] reinforce library to re-load,"Hi,

I am wondering if there is a parameter in library() so that it can
reinforce package to be reloaded. It helps when you test your modified
package by yourself. Otherwise, my way is to re-start Rgui.

(by reading ?library, I understand this option is not implemented)
""...Both functions check and update the list of currently loaded
packages and do not reload a package which is already loaded.
(Furthermore, if the package has a name space and a name space of that
name is already loaded, they work from the existing names space rather
than reloading from the file system.)""

Thanks.

i know john sees a need to focus on re - establishing our position in the texas gas maket . if we combine the ercot / mexico power origination with texas and mexico gas , then this will build on my power skills , knowledge of the texas gas market , and my non - us market experience .
dave is on board with me heading up the power development activities and probably would be more on board with me focusing on ercot as this would be less disruptive to his business .

re: e-books and the blind in the United States,"There's the British Museum cryptanalysis package which according to Chuck 
Hallenbech who wrote me about it earlier is pretty effective in doing its 
work.  Simtel mirrors many years ago had some very basic encryption and 
decryption packages on them and those may have been removed.  There's all 
kinds of password cracking utilities used by hackers to open up files that 
oughtn't be available to them too.  If you ever get any of those, please 
first run them through with clamscan and if you get a good report proceed 
with caution.  Finally, the data file formats handbook latest edition will 
probably provide a huge amount of help in certain instances.  Get the 
latest edition though since it gets updated just about every year.

Re: [R] converting character strings to numbers,"There is no support for 'thousands separators' in R's input/conversion 
routines, mainly because C has no support either (not even for output in 
the C standard).  We could of course add our own layer, but as far as I am

some after thoughts to our meeting,"hi daren ,
i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning .
you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for
success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .
you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team .
this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this
problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem ?
there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members ?
i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing !

HGH really helps!,"Content-Type: text/plain;

 What is HGH Life?

 HGH Life is our patented formula of Human Growth Hormone, amino acids,
and the most-potent growth factors, all in one pill. It was designed with
anti-aging in mind, and has been noted for increased energy and alertness,
stronger muscles and bones, better looking skin, increased libido and overall
beneficial health benefits in America and abroad for the last several years.

How does HGH Life work?

HGH Life supplements the ever decreasing amount of growth hormone secreted
by the pituitary gland as we get older. The result is youthful feeling
and appearance, increased energy, memory and metabolism, stronger immune
system function, increased tissue repair, cell replacement, and bone strength,
and healthier skin, nails and teeth. In other words, it creates an overall,
more youthful you!

Gtk2::GladeXML and TreeView,"Hello,

for a few days i try to get into Glade. So far it looks very interesting
and promising to me. But it seems i'm too stupid to understand how
GtkTreeView is working. 
Can someone provide me an easy to understand example or point me to some
howto? I've read a few c- and python howtos, none of them helped me
(well, i'm fairly new to perl and that's the first programming language i
really try to get into). http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/doc/pod/Gtk2/
helped my a lot with other stuff, but just confuses me with TreeView.

The rounding is fine, it is just that one of the values is huge, so thatexponential notation is used. If you insist, start playing around withformatC. Something like

[R] Sum of specific column,"I have a data set that I have imported (not sure if that makes a
difference) and I would like to calculate the sum of only specific
columns.  I have tried
>colSums(dataset, by=list(dataset$col5), dims=1) and I get an error of
unused arguments
I have also tried
>aggregate(dataset, by=list(dataset$col5), sum) and I get the error that
sum is not meaningful for factors.

I want to only calculate the sum for specific columns because some of
the columns have words in them and I have not been able to find anything
else that would help or why these errors are occuring.

I figure you can. The problem that we were trying to solve at the time,
IIRC, was that people were not particularly anxious to mirror the CD images
(as in .iso files).

If you remove it, the CDImage- prefix will remain, and it will be a bit off,
but it's not really a problem.

as far is i understand, there´s a dummy var introduced for every  
possible outcome ( 0 , 1, 2 ,3) . this is nice because it contains a  
lot of information, but far more than i need.
and i have to many variables to research to use dummies for every  
single one of them. Can i get one coefficient per variable ?

Is there another package for logistic regression ? did is use the  
factor thing the wrong way ?

thx in advance

I missed that entirely.  I was groggier than I
realised yesterday afternoon. I had at least once left
nts in existance in the same environment where ukn is
called, thus getting an intermitant error. In that
environment nts$cda was named!

Yes.  I had already tried calling it within the ukn
environment not realising that I had not named the
elements so this was my last try.

This has been very helpful though I still do not
understand why one must call nts$cda using the
eval(parse()) command.  Is it because nts is created
within the ukn environment?  

I have had a look at S-Poetry but will need to spend a
lot more time on this.  

I thought that this was not the best way to do things
but I wanted to avoid doing a lot of earlier
manipulations to my data files and so decided to go
with what I had.

If the test has to be that complex, we can easily live with less than full 
coverage.

If file tests in Perl don't work, we have bigger problems than less than full 
coverage.

GCompris can be seen as a game engine, we call it the core, and each
activity rely on it to play. In our case, the gcompris binary contains
the game engine and within each activity directory you can find either a
bunch of C or python files for the activity code.

For python activity, it would make sense to have a GCompris core in
python but for now we don't have it.

in a nutshell :
the governor and assembly leadership ( without rod wright ) have reached
agreement and believe they have the 41 votes to support the below :
o there will be a $ 2 . 9 billion bailout that can be used to pay the qf ' s and
the banks , but not the generators - either directly or indirectly - and will be
recovered through a dedicated rate component charged to consumers 20 kwh and
above .
o business and consumer interests are being briefed at the moment by the
staff of davis and angelides on the proposal .
o the easement language is consistent with the language proposed in 78 xx
o the renewable portfolio standard language is primarily consistent with
82 xx however discussions on final language are continuing now .
o regarding the transmission lines and direct access , language has not been
written and discussions are also continuing . in fact much of the bill is
being drafted now and is said to circulate tomorrow among members . davis
has indicated that he wants a vote as soon as thursday
o the senate has not agreed , but there are staff meetings going on now .
o the cpuc has not involved in the discussions , but the administration
continues to assure that no cpuc action will be taken in contrary to the
language of the bill .
please feel free to call with questions and as always we will keep you
posted .
thanks ,

Samba 3.0.25rc1 AVailable for Download,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

==============================================================
                                      Port 80 is the new HTTP.
                             -- Jeremy Allison on Web Services
==============================================================
Release Announcements
=====================
This is the first release candidate of the Samba 3.0.25 code
base and is provided for testing only.  An RC release means
that we are close to the final release but the code may still
have a few remaining minor bugs.  This release is *not* intended
for production servers.  There has been a substantial amount
of development since the 3.0.23/3.0.24 series of stable releases.
We would like to ask the Samba community for help in testing
these changes as we work towards the next significant production
upgrade Samba 3.0 release.

Major features included in the 3.0.25 code base include:

  o Significant improvements in the winbind off-line logon support.
  o Support for secure DDNS updates as part of the 'net ads join'
    process.
  o Rewritten IdMap interface which allows for TTL based caching and
    per domain backends.
  o New plug-in interface for the ""winbind nss info"" parameter.
  o New file change notify subsystem which is able to make use of
    inotify on Linux.
  o Support for passing Windows security descriptors to a VFS
    plug-in allowing for multiple Unix ACL implements to running side
    by side on the Same server.
  o Improved compatibility with Windows Vista clients including
    improved read performance with Linux servers.
  o Man pages for VFS plug-ins.


Off-line Logons and AD Site Support
===================================

Winbind's capability to support offline logons has been greatly
improved with the 3.0.25 release including support for locating
domain controllers asynchronously using Active Directory Site
information.


New IdMap Interface for Winbindd
================================

The 3.0.25 release of Samba will include a rewritten IdMap interface
for winbindd which replaces the ""idmap backend"" parameter.  The
initial design document may be found at

	http://www.samba.org/~idra/samba3_newidmap.pdf

Please refer to the ""idmap domains"" description in the smb.conf(5)
man page for more details.


Dynamic DNS Updates
===================

The ""net ads join"" command is now able to register the host's DNS
A records with Windows 2000 SP4 and 2003 DNS servers.  This
feature must be enabled at compile time using the --with-dnsupdate
when running the ./configure script.  There is also a related ""net
ads dns"" command for refreshing a host's records which could be
launched from a dhcp client script when a new IP address is obtained.


Support for Additional ACL Modules
==================================

Samba's POSIX ACL support has been moved inside of the VFS layer
which means it is now possible to support multiple ACL implementations
on the same server including NFSv4 and GPFS ACLs.


VFS ReadAhead Plugin
====================

Windows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved
performance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin
allows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers
for caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving
Vista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between
Linux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead
module by adding the following lines to the share definition
in smb.conf:

[file_share]
	vfs objects = readahead

Note that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements
due to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.
Please refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.

You are probably right. My primary goal was to get the build
working on a system at all. I have taken the defines from
heimdal/lib/hdb/hdb.c more or less blindly...

I have to reconsider this.

phone : 234 - 80 - 33231814
attn : madam / sir .
dear ,
i am dr ahmed chuka chisom a deputy director in the federal ministry of works we can transfer the sum of us $ 13 . m ( thirteen million united states dollars ) .
the sum arose from the deliberate over - invoicing of contracts bills of some contracts awarded by my ministry during the interim government of former military leader , general abdulsalam abubakah who handed over the government to the democratically elected government in 30 th may 1999 . since then the money has been lying in a suspense current account of my ministry with the central bank of nigeria . however , the current favourable political / economic climate in the country presented an
opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country without hitch .
a friend who was formally residing in your country made your company address available to us . he assured us of your company ? s reputability and capability in business transactions . however , he does not know the details and nature of the impending transaction . this assurance gave us confidence to contact you for this particular transaction , and i believe it would be of mutual benefit to both of us .
we have put in motion the machinery for the take off of this transaction and further action will commence immediately we hear from you . we have agreed that after the transfer of the money into your account , you shall be entitled to 20 % of the total sum , my colleagues and i shall take 75 % while 5 % has been mapped out to reimburse all local and international expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction .
the nature of your business is not particularly relevant for the success of this transaction , all we require is your willingness to co - operate andassurance that our own share will be given to us when this money arrives your account . all necessary precautions have been taken , to ensure a no risk situation on the sides of both parties and it is believed that this transaction will take 14 working days , to finalize .
please if this proposal is acceptable to you , contact me on the above phone number or e - mail address . should you have any question , feel free to contact me on the same numbers . if however , you are not interested in this proposal , kindly let me know and do not disclose the contents of this letter to a third party .
please include your private telephone and fax numbers while replying this letter for easy communications .

I'd say it's pretty safe. This code path authentiates a
foreign user, and for those we locally don't really care
about the password change times. The only situation where we
do care is when we're authoritative for that user ourself,
but then we don't initialize from an info3 struct but from
the SAM.

So I'd say that only in this particular situation (PDC
passing through a trusted user) we read the values out of
the sam_account again. But it has certainly not seen the
full test matrix.

So if you want a vote from me, I'd put it in. (fingers
crossed ;-))

tejas deliveries at oasis katy,"on tuesday , march 7 th , tejas took gas from us at oasis katy and gave it back
to us at tejas laporte to help us out during an outage for $ . 02 / mmbtu . this
transaction has not been scheduled correctly . there are two deal tickets in
sitara to cover the oasis portion of the deal : # 213145 covers ena selling
the gas to hplc for hplc to transport on tejas . deal # 213370 covers the
transport usage on tejas from oasis katy to laporte . i have edited this
ticket to add the $ . 02 / mm charge . there needs to be a tejas expense contract
at laporte , # 665 , to cover the approx . 25 , 000 mm received there on the 7 th .
these volumes are currently sitting on the laporte oba .
jackie - if you would work with carlos he should be able to walk you through

It is not about the file but about the (or each) row.
Maybe something more like:

     # each row contains comma separated values, split them up into an
array

>    @x[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]=split/,/;

There are several ways to rewrite this. I think I would go for:

     my @x = (split /,/)[0..6];

or if I would know that after element 6 there are not multi-megabytes of
data:

     my @x = split /,/, $_, 8;  # put the remainder in $x[7]

or even just

     my @x = split /,/;

> $x[6]=~s/\s//gm;
> $sth->execute($x[2], $x[5], $x[4], $x[6]) or die ""Error executing
> <{Statement}>> with values @x[2,5,4,6]: $DBI::errstr"";
> }

That needs reformatting, to make your code easier to read. Whitespace is
cheap.

      $x[6] = ~s/^[[:blank:]]+//;  # ltrim

      $sth->execute( @x[ 2, 5, 4, 6 ] )
          or die ""Error executing <{Statement}>>""
               . "" with values '@x[2, 5, 4, 6]': $DBI::errstr"";

I want to give individual colors to all elements in a simple stacked

on january 12 , i hosted a brainstorming session at the four seasons hotel in
downtown houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and
back office services we could offer to the commodity industry . to complete a
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture , we are hosting an
integrated design session facilitated by cap gemini ernst & young ( cgey ) at
their accelerated solutions environment in dallas , texas .
i am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this design
session . this is a critical two - day event to be held february 12 th and 13 th
in dallas , texas . this work session is based on a unique approach called a
designshop  v . it is a very focused , activity - driven event that is composed of
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups . if you
have not attended one of the designshops related to sap , you will likely
regard this session as different from any working session you have previously
experienced . the prior designshops held in conjunction with sap have proven
to be very successful . therefore , we have elected to utilize this same
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture .
a limited number of representatives from enron will be attending . you were
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in the
designshop . you are being asked to participate in the full two days with as
little distraction or interruption as possible . the quality of our results
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the
entire event . additionally , you will be relied on in the future to support
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session .
this date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods so
that your participation can be maximized . therefore , please make all
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during
these two days .
please review the attached information regarding hotel , flight information ,
and transportation . preliminary information as to schedule and environment
has also been included . you may direct any additional questions concerning
the event to mary solmonson at ( 713 ) - 853 - 6079 .
i hope that you will be able to participate . please confirm your attendance
for the two days with marvia jefferson at 713 - 853 - 9165 by january 29 th 5 : 00
p . m . if you are unable to attend , it may be appropriate to select someone
else to participate . please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to
take your place until you and i have discussed this .
i thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing you

How to add this test to Samba4?,"Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I would like to add the RAW-QFILEINFO-IPC test to Samba4.  This test
runs against IPC$, but is picked up in the --list of all RAW tests, so I
have to add a 'skip' entry for it in the samba4-skip file (as it will
fail against a file share, as it opens /pipe/lsass).

I tried to do this, but the skip entry is overriding this too.=20

The other option is the fold it into the RAW-QFILEINFO test, and detect
that the share is IPC$ somehow. =20

Thoughts?

Thanks Bernhard, find herebelow some remarks.

I think we should add a mirror test page so that admins can be sure of
the state of their mirror (no, http://www.de.debian.org/dmc/today is not
enough complete), because there are so many parameters defining a
""mirror good to be added"".

Added.

==========================================================================

I have just added it, see #422305

==========================================================================

> + debian.funlam.edu.co
>   Aliases: www.funlam.edu.co

http://debian.funlam.edu.co/debian/project/trace/ contains no
debian.funlam.edu.co nore www.funlam.edu.co local trace file.
The local trace file should be the site name if possible, it makes QA
much easier.

>   Type: leaf
>   Archive-http: /debian/

http://debian.funlam.edu.co/debian/dists/ shows (we cannot see the whole
name of certain directories) that
http://www.us.debian.org/mirrors/ftpmirror#settings is not applied.

According to http://debian.funlam.edu.co/debian/pool/main/b/base-files/
the dsc files are missing.

>   Mirrors-from: ftp.debian.org

We must not mirror from ftp.debian.org
http://www.us.debian.org/mirrors/ftpmirror#wherefrom given that saens is
saturated : http://saens.debian.org/mrtg/saens.eth0.html

I guess it is not private anymore .. (but don't worry, once in the CVS,
it would have been the same)

http://debian.funlam.edu.co/debian-non-us/ can be removed.

The info about the architectures mirrored is missing

==========================================================================

> +  mirror.ynet.sk/debian

Same remark about the name of the local trace file.
http://mirror.ynet.sk/debian/project/trace/gentoo.ynet.sk

>   Packages archive, over HTTP: /debian/

Same httpd config as above.

The info about the architectures mirrored is missing

>   Mirror is updated from: ftp.cz.debian.org

Good cheer for your future mail conversation with admins :-)

If you still have some unprocessed backlog, I can help.

(Tip: adding people to the mirrors alias would help to process mails
before it becomes outdated backlog :-)

+1 from me.    I show the following revision in my local branch

  Samba(""3.0.27pre1-GIT-0bd4d99e-[SVN-SAMBA_3_0@23601]"")

I have noticed that mkversion.sh is newer in SAMBA_4_0 so
I'll merge it across nice you check this in.

laughter is the shortest distance between two people .
i wasted time , now time doth waste me .",1
your help,"dear sir ,
i am mrs mariam abacha , wife of the late nigerian
head of state , general sani abacha who died on
the 8 th
of june 1998 while still on active duty . i am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will
be of
great assistance to each other likewise
developing a
cordial relationship .
i currently have within my reach the sum of
thirty
six million united states dollars
( us $ 36 , 000 , 000 ) in
cash , which i intend to use for investment
purposes
specifically in your country . this money came
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my
late
husband and a russian firm on our country ' s
multi - billion dollars ajaokuta steel plant . the
russian partners returned my husbands share of
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 after his death and lodge it with
my
late husband ' s security company in nigeria of
which i
am a director . right now the new civilian
government
have intensified their probe on my husband ' s
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company .
in view
of this , i acted very fast to withdraw the
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 from the company ' s vault and
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad .
no record ever existed concerning the money
neither is
the money traceable by the government because
there is
no documentation showing that we received the
money
from the russians .
due to the current situation in the country
concerning
government attitude towards my family , it has
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this
money
within , thus i seek assistance to transfer this
money
into your safe bank account . on your consent , i
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction .
bearing in mind that your assistance is needed
to
transfer the funds , i propose a commission of
20 % of
the total sum to you for the expected services
and
assistance . your urgent response is highly
needed so
as to stop further contacts . all correspondent
should be forwarded to this email : zenab . m @ ompadec . zzn . con
or you can call my son mobile : hamza 234 - 8023137978 i use this
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while i
await your
prompt response .
best personal regards ,
mrs mariam abacha .

i sit on nicholas's side of the fence. maybe i've been working on
windows too long, but this is the behavior i've come to expect. if a
function is not meant for public consumption, why is it available?
let's learn from the mistakes of previous designers and earlier
technologies.

when designing and implementing parrot's embedding/extending api, it'd
be nice if the linker failed on platforms other than windows. this
patch will accomplish that nicely.

"[Ip-health] ""breaking"" patents","Dear friends

I don't work directly in drug patenting arena but on IPR as it affects
people's control over biodiversity. Still, it's extremely annoying how
the mainstream media are getting away with all this talk of ""breaking""
patents to describe what the governments of Brazil and Thailand have
recently done through compulsory licensing. I'm not a lawyer but I don't
understand how they can use this kind of terminology since the
possibility of such licensing is written into patent law not to mention
the TRIPS Agreement. It's part of the deal when you get a patent. So
what is being broken?

It reminds me of the campaign to instill the word ""piracy"" in our minds,
to demonise people who copy (regardless of how people understand fair
use under copyright law or what they think is legitimate).

Unless this term ""breaking"" patents is really correct, the media should
be challenged and stopped from using it any further. No?

thanks & kind regards

this sheet illustrates the main reporting lines for the front , middle and
back office ( s ) up to the "" office of the chair "" for enron europe . though the
mechanting business is used for illustrative purposes , for financial trading
simply substitute mike farmer and howard carter with michael hutchinson and
kevin rhodes respectively .
staff
this sheet simply attaches names to each of the middle and back office
functional groups indicated in the sheet entitled org . staff within the
middle office functional groups have been introduced to the dual reporting
concept whereby they report to both the business controller and functional
lead .
the intention is that quite soon after moving into enron house the functional
teams for both financial trading and mechanting will start to more closely
together . the influence of the functional leads should ensure that these
teams are blended into a generic enron metals support group , where possible
leveraging across the other trading support groups .
any questions , please call x 34264 .

Re: [R] Combine graphical and textual output,"The R2HTML package can be used to create and html transcript of your
session (you do need to start, end, and tell it to include graphs).  I
use this when doing an R demonstration (teaching), so that the students
can have a transcript that shows the commands I typed along with their
output (including the graphs).  

Another approach is the odfWeave package.  This is similar to sweave,
except that you use openoffice writer (can read MSWord docs) to set up
the text and set of commands (less overhead/startup than LaTeX).

Hope this helps,

Seeing this worries me. I don't know enough about what's going on to
tell whether it's wrong or not, but it looks wrong. When the outer
loop goes on to the second iteration, what does $tix->Next yield? (You
could use the debugger to find out.)

You're doing the same dereferencing, just getting deeper each time.
You'll save some time if you make some of those into temporary
variables. That fourth nested loop could look more like this, but
possibly with better variable names:

        my $subjects_hash = $envs_hash->{$env};
        foreach my $subject (keys %$subjects_hash) {

>                                 my @endTime;
> #                               my $temp          = $tickets{$user}{$env}{$tikID};

>                                 $endTime[0]       = $temp[0];
>                                 $endTime[1]       = $temp % 60;
> #                               $tickets{$user}{$env}{$tikID} = sprintf '%d:%02d', @endTime[0,1];
>                                 $tickets{$user}{$env}{$tikID}{$subject} = sprintf '%d:%02d', @endTime[0,1];

That looks like a difficult way to do it. Maybe something like this?

          $subjects_hash->{$subject} = time_format($subjects_hash->{$subject});

sub time_format {
    my $arg = shift;
    return sprintf '%d:%02d', int($arg / 60), $arg % 60;
}

That code assumes, as did the original, that the number to be
formatted is a non-negative integer of seconds or minutes.

Good luck with it!

testimonial from donna f . , in california ; i am so glad this business was
available to me . i have worked in many fields , but always for other people
and for the salary they thought i was worth . what i really wanted was a
chance to work for myself and get the respect and pay i deserved . i also
wanted to find a way to balance my personal life with my business life .
furthermore , since my husband is a teacher and has time off during the
summer , i wanted to be able to take time off when he is off . i am pleased to
tell you that since i began my judgment recovery business through you , i
have been able to reach all of these goals . i have to admit that i had
doubts about it . when i first heard of collecting judgments for others , i
thought no one would want to pay me to do this for them , or that i would
have to work at it long and hard and get little compensation , or that i did
not have the expertise to make a business of this . it just seemed too good
to be true . at first , i worked at another job and could only spend about 4
hours each week on my business . but i decided to stick it out and see what i
could do and now i am so glad i did ! i work strictly from my home and i am
happy to tell you that i have a steady monthly income , that i get to take
time off with my husband as well as to pursue my hobbies and family matters ,
and that i don ' t spend long hours slaving away to make a living any more . my
clients are thrilled to pay the percentage i ask . last month i made 2 , 000 us
clear on one case alone . that , of course , has encouraged me to double my
efforts . finally , i want to emphasize how much i appreciate your continued
support . every time i e - mail or call you with a new question ( i keep
learning new things - that is also a plus to this business ) , you tell me
what to do or check it out for me . it is so nice to know that i have an
expert to call . thank you so much for being there for me .
the next moment he was sound asleep , sprawling upon his back in the shade
and slumbering as peacefully as an infant . and while he lay motionless three
men dropped in quick succession from the top of the city wall and hid among
the low bushes , crawling noiselessly from one to another and so approaching ,
by degrees , the little group of trees
they were turks , and had been sent by those in authority within the city to
climb the tallest tree of the group and discover if the enemy was near",1

hey , sorry about not calling you last thur & fri - i was out sick . i think
that were going to have to play this assistance thing on a day to day basis .
i know i will be catching up for missing those days & i need to get some
things in order this week for the new guy that starts next week . so i ' ll
just have to call you when i can spare the time . sorry for any inconvenience
this may have caused you !

new ! cialis soft tabs .,"hello !
we would like to offer cialis soft tabs ,
these pills are just like regular cialis but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the
mouth and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .
you can get it at :

business proposal,"from : mr . bello umanah
phone : + 234 804 332 6495
email : belloumanah @ box . az
dear sir ,
re : business proposal
i am making this contact with you in good faith , my name is mr bello
umanah , the personal accounting officer to late hon . chuba okadigbo , the
former nigeria senate president . herein after shall be referred to as my
client .
during my client ' s tenure as nigeria senate president , he was in charge of
federal government investments abroad from which he accrued so much money .
and having a personal intention of investing abroad after his tenure , he
secretly deposited the sum of us $ 20 million ( twenty million united states
dollars ) with a finance house in madrid , spain .
but unfortunately , he died on thursday september 25 , 2003 leaving this
huge amount of money in the custody of the finance house without claim
from anybody . as the personal accounting officer , i was the only person he
confided in and therefore the only person that knows about the existence
of this funds as he was avoiding implications since he was in service
then .
now i am interested in a foreign investor with a sound business proposal
who will assist me to claim this money for our mutual benefits , hence i
personally appeal to you seriously for your urgent assistance to move this
money into your country where i believe it will be judiciously invested
for the benefit of both of us .
i have in my possession every legal document to backup your claim , all i
require is your capability and honest cooperation . and i will appreciate
if you could keep this proposal secret even if you are not capable or do
not want to assist me .
as i await your response through my private email address :
belloumanah @ box . az , i would also want you to go though the below websites
for more details :
best regards ,

Yes, but

- the Matrix library is the file Matrix.so or Matrix.dll which
 is part of the installed (aka ""binary"") Matrix *package*
 Maybe you really need to read the result of
    fortune(""package.*Maechler"")  # after installing package 'fortunes'

- ""please report"" was not meant to say to report to R-help,
  but to the package maintainers,

- since you cannot reproduce it yet, we cannot do much about it.
  It may be a bug in the Matrix package (and Jose has told me
  that he's using the latest released version 0.99875-2),
  but in theory it could even be your own mistake, namely by
  wrongly manipulating the slots of a Matrix object.

Please try to produce an R script - even if not small -- with a
reproducible example;
[and then do report to  Matrix-authors@r-project.org].

    JQ> Thanks -- Jose Quesada, PhD.

Martin Maechler, ETH Zurich

SET_NULL,"From include/parrot/parrot.h:

/* weird architectures might need this, s. C-FAQ 5.17
*
* the SET_NULL macros are only for system, where a NULL pointer
* isn't represented by zeroes, so don't use these, for resetting
* non-null pointers
*/

#ifdef HAS_NON_ZERO_NULL
#  define SET_NULL(x) x = NULL
#  define SET_NULL_P(x, s) x = (s)NULL
#else
#  define SET_NULL(x)
#  define SET_NULL_P(x, s)
#endif /* HAS_NON_ZERO_NULL */


This seems very wrong.  SET_NULL() isn't actually setting any values  
if not HAS_NON_ZERO_NULL.  Is there some reason it's not actually

#  define SET_NULL(x)      x = 0
#  define SET_NULL_P(x, s) x = (s)NULL

And for that matter, what's wrong with just using x = NULL  
everywhere?  Why do we need a macro to do this?

ryan and i have looked at the research model and made some adjustments .
the treasury rate at 12 / 28 / 00 was 5 . 127 % ( research uses 4 . 6 % which probably
takes into account the recent fed 50 bp cut )
the maturity is 6 / 30 / 03 or 2 . 5 years ( research uses 3 years )
using these assumptions and a 47 . 2 % volatility in the bloomberg collar
function results in a ceiling of 92 103 / 256 and a floor of 34 7 / 8 . after
adjusting the research model for the changes above , ryan and i got a similar
range from the research model so we are comfortable with these numbers .
let me know if there are any questions .

here ' s the calculation using the historical volatility . the strike drops
slightly . the volatility in the calculation is the expected future
vol ; atility - looking at traded options for hc and an expected fall off in
vol for long dated options , one could justify a vol estimate in the range 40
- 50 % for the collar .
the presence of the swap makes no difference on the collar valuation .

Amely S., Bellevue WA

 
""Since the very childhood I was a bulky boy. 

Its difficult to fancy how I abhorred being mocked at school. 

I detested my plumpness and I detested myself. 

After trying this and that I learned about Anatrim. 

This stuff literally dragged me out of this dreadful nightmare! The greatest respect to you, guys.""

 
Rikky Martin, New York

 
""Do you know what? Anatrim preserved my marriage! I got into this circle, depression  more eating  more depression. My wife was about to leave the overweight psycho I was turning in. 

Once my friend pointed to your web page and I ordered Anatrim immediately. 

The results were magnficent, my appetite became normal, I was in good spirits oftener, and, of course, I tightened my belt with no regrets. And you see me, the sex became fantastic also!""

 
Mikkey

 There is a great number of gratitudes left by happy people taking Anatrim. Why don't you add yourself to the tens of thousands of slim women and men and take this all-natural appetite suppressing energy increasing product now!

My view of this is something along these lines.  You can use any 
function you want at all, but if it's not documented as part of the 
supported API, there's nothing saying I won't purposely break your code 
in the next release.  In big bold red letters of course.

Thanks for pointing this out! (And if I had astutely done
help.search(""marginal"") I would have found it).

That is probably a fair point (real-life situations where both
margins are objectively fixed are probably sparse, to the point
where it may almost be worth collecting them as an ""exhibition"").

But then Bingshan Li is faced with the issue that the power
(given the odds-ratio) is then dependent on one of the cell
probabilities as a ""nuisance parameter"". This of course can
be eliminated by conditioning on the total number of successes
over the dimension whose marginals are fixed; but then we are
in effect back to the Fisher Exact Test, whose power is a function
of the odds-ratio alone.

I'm still with Duncan Murdoch, in that what's meant by ""power""
in this case depends very much on what you mean by ""alternative
hypothesis"".

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Reducing your appetite means increasing your self esteem,"Weight is a major problem everywhere.  Many people battle the bulge every day and hope that they will find a diet that works for them.  However, you don't need a fad diet to lose weight.  You don't need expensive gym memberships either.  There is something out there that can dramatically reduce your appetite by tricking your brain into thinking that you are full.

http://www.ykufuyfua.com/

People eat for lots of different reasons, hunger isn't the only one.  There are many reasons why people resort to food as a comforter but old habits die hard.  What if I were to tell you that there is a simple way to lose weight?  A way that, the television favourite, Oprah herself claims to work!  Want to know what she recommends?

http://www.ykufuyfua.com/

Cosmetic surgeries and diets are quick and easy ways out but they also have side effects that can't be avoided, not only that but the bills from surgeries are astronomical!  Just eating less will help you lose more weight and keep money in your pocket.  Harder said than done?  Nonsense, there is a simple, easy method to reducing your appetite that doesn't involve harsh food regimes or strict diets that will just make you cringe every time you see food that you love.  If you want to eat what you always eat but still lose weight and feel great then click below.

One day I heard about Anatrim in the media and I rather liked the information.

 I had tried to use it, and my wife said I had changed for the better since then, 4 months later. 

31 pounds have gone away and I keep still losing them!

Yes.

For both lvm and for encrypted filesystems /boot needs to be a normal
filesystem.  The initrd will load all of the needed modules and so
needs to be accessible without those modules.  Make it ext2.  I made
mine just a little bit bigger than really required so that I could use
it as a ""drop box"" for things like the ipw2200 firmware blobs without
needing to mount the encrypted partition.

Also, if the installer tries to load lilo instead of grub then you
have tripped into a case where ""something is wrong"" (IMNHO, since I am
a convert to grub and no longer desire lilo).  Start again and check
everything.  When things are right the d-i will install grub.

I should walk through the install procedure once on a test machine and
capture the process.  But I am sure someone will have already done
that.  Once you have been through it then it all makes sense.  But the
first time through can be a little confusing.

  hda1 /boot primary partition (ext2)
  hda5_crypt encrypted partition (logical is my preference, but no matter)
    vg0 lvm2 volume group
      vg0-root logical partition, root of filesystem (ext3 in my case)
      vg0-swap logical partition, swap

[Ip-health] Re: Merck lowers price on efavirenz to meet generic price,"Dear Prof.Baker
    Last week, we organised a seminar on CL at
National Legistration Assembly and invited Dr.Mongkol
Na Songkla, the Minister of MOPH to present what he
have done during the US and Geneva trips.
    He states clearly that even MERCK is quite a good
company, comparing with Abbott, always lower the EFV
price for Thailand, he told MERCK that if the price is
not more than 5% without anycondition, MOPH will buy
the brand name. However MOPH will contuinue buy some
amont from generic company because it prevents the
blackmail of big pharmas. He also reaffirms that  MOPH
will not revoke the CLs.
    So this position is still confirmed. Report of
media are not really well covered and not give any
detail.
     Thanks for your recommend.

Thanks, that's very useful information. I'll adjust nice level of
speechd-up on grml, hopefully it improves the situation once more. :)

california update 6 / 1 / 01,"below are details of new plan currently being created by california state treasurer phil angelides and supported by sen . burton . the plan is in the initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast - track . it is also not motivated by a desire to save socal from bankruptcy . the creator ' s goal is to give californians more control over their energy and electric futures as well as giving the tax / rate payers a share of the pie in return for money that has / will go to the utilities . we will continue to monitor this plan , its supporters and progress .
plan z
california state treasurer phil angelides and a powerful group of legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve california ' s energy crisis this summer . the group is comprised of leftish legislators , environmental advocates , in - state energy company executives and business leaders and they are pulling together a plan z . at the core of the plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a california public power authority that issues bonds , constructs new power plants and buys up transmission lines . there is even talk within this group of using newly legislated authority to buy socal edison for $ 3 . 5 billion ( less than it owes ) although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power companies as well as edison itself .
the five - year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee a 5 % - 15 % "" cushion "" against energy peak demand . angelides and burton want to create enough capacity to form a buyer ' s market . one of the points of the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector generation . this plan may short - circuit private sector plans to build new plants , but the state has the ability to issue $ 5 b in revenue - backed bonds ( in addition to the $ 12 b rate - backed bonds ) . the second key element in the angelides - burton plan z is additional rate hikes for california ' s consumers and businesses . although discussions are still underway between this group and business leaders , angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45 % increase in residential and commercial electricity rates , however , there is immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on businesses . this increase is on top of the 50 % - 60 % already mandated by previous puc decisions this year . these rate increases will do two things : stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of california and prevent emergency tax hikes ( being serious considered last week ) .
issues to consider in regards to this plan are : ( 1 ) how much will current shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long - owed debts ( or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of socal edison ) ; and ( 2 ) how much will creditors have to "" eat "" in the legislated repayment plan ? in other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts be ? there is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year .",0

RE: comparison of different distros,"What I like about debian is that you don't end up installing stuff you don't
need.

If I had to use Linux in a work environment though, I'd pick Fedora for the
opposite reason: my employer would want me using an operating system that
was complete and they'd provide me a nice big hard disk to hold it all.

Since I run on budget computers, and I fool with and screw up the system a
lot I prefer slackware or debian.

you ignore what i wrote. im glad if you stay and keep on ask important questions
but please recognise that there are some core decisions that define the language
called perl, and when we change them its no longer perl. so please dont feel offended
to me its a matter of logic and practibality. 

and to me it maybe sometime usefull dont write as much "";"" but keep out sigils
i definitly dont like because it became much harder readable to me and the whole
subject of twigils and siginiture sigils goes down the toilet whenn we throw that
one away.

so i hope you understand me now better

I think it will remain important to be *able* to down a target server in
these cases, particularly if we wish to do things like have a preferred
DC, or just for debugging. =20

I'm a little mixed on this.  Something like get_args probably shouldn't 
be getargs or even getArgs, but if you look through ops.num, it can be 
confusing to know what is what.  Although not for beginners, scanning 
through ops.num can help figure out why your code doesn't compile as 
expected.

Perhaps a namespace specific code can be used, and maybe applicable for 
nested namespaces such that hll's can easily take advantage, so an hll 
can say in it's root namespace ""I want exceptions"" and all namespaces 
in that hll default to using exceptions.  A file specific option would 
be bug prone with something like pbc_merge or whatever, and making it 
namespace specific seems simple and clean, even if a little too DWIM 
for parrot.

"[Ip-health] Reaction of AIDS groups, public health organizations to trade policy
 announcement","HEALTH GAP   ESSENTIAL ACTION  STUDENT GLOBAL AIDS CAMPAIGN

Reaction from Public Health, AIDS organizations to Democratic
Leadership-Bush Administration Announcement on Trade Policy

On Friday May 11, the House Democratic leadership and the Bush
Administration announced an agreement on trade issues, including
patent and access-to-medicines-related provisions of trade agreements
with Peru and Panama.

We remain concerned that while some first steps have been taken to
lessen the harm of U.S. trade agreements, it is still the case that,
if passed by Congress, these trade agreements with Peru and Panama
will restrict rather than expand access to lifesaving medicines.

The first thing that must be said about the agreement is: nothing
definitive can be said until more details emerge, and final textual
amendments are presented. In the case of trade agreements, details
and specificity are of crucial importance.

A better process would have involved a transparent discussion of key
issues, and an opportunity for more structured input and comment on
unfolding details from Members of Congress and the public. That
better process could only have yielded a better outcome.

On the substance, it appears the Democratic leadership has taken some
first steps to make U.S. trade agreements less harmful to public
health. It is not true, as some news accounts have suggested, that
the May 11 deal will limit brand-name drug companies' patent and
related monopolies. In a best-case scenario, what the deal will do is
limit the extent to which U.S. trade agreements expand brand-name
drug companies' monopolies.

However, arguing about how to make trade deals ""less harmful"" is the
wrong framework. When it comes to public health, the United States
should aspire to a higher standard: first, and at minimum, to do no
harm; and  second, to use international agreements to address access-
to-medicines,  efficient innovation of medical technologies and other
pressing global public health priorities. Trade agreements modified
in accord with the May 11 announcement will fail to meet that test.

More will be required in order to meet previously guaranteed rights
that countries can prioritize public health and take measures to
guarantee access to medicines for all. The Democratic leadership was
not able to  eliminate all of the life-threatening provisions in U.S.
trade agreements, which  themselves build on a World Trade
Organization framework that is already  heavily biased to favor Big
Pharma.

For example, the preservation of data exclusivity alone is a gigantic
gift to Big Pharma. Data exclusivity -- rules preventing generics
from  relying on clinical test data from brand-name companies -- is
Big Pharma's top agenda item for trade deals, and a major impediment
to generic competition. In addition, the reported time limits and
exceptions to data exclusivity announced on May 11 may be narrower
than initially reported.

Moreover, it is very dangerous to give any additional latitude to an
administration that has shown itself to operate in bad faith on
access-to-medicines issues. Just last month, USTR placed Thailand on
the ""priority watch"" list for lawfully issuing compulsory licenses.
Formal rights preserved in free trade agreements are of limited value
if  USTR is going to apply informal pressure, use the Special 301
process,  and coerce countries during trade agreement implementation
phases -- all to undermine access-to-medicines initiatives.

Developing countries should be free from agreements and USTR
pressures that restrict their rights to use all available
flexibilities for accessing more affordable generic medicines to meet
their public health needs.  Members of Congress should insist on a
new approach to access to medicines issues with trading partners,
rather than accepting a partial package of reforms.

[R] Jarque-Bera and rnorm(),"Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Folks,

I'm a bit puzzled by the fact that if I generate 100,000 standard normal 
variates using rnorm() and perform the Jarque-Bera on the resulting vector, 
I get p-values that vary drastically from run to run. Is this expected? 
Surely the p-val should be close to 1 for each test?

Are 100,000 variates sufficient for this test?

Or is it that rnorm() is not a robust random number generator? I looked at 
the skewness and excess kurtosis, and the former seems to be unstable, which 
leads me to think that is why JB is failing.

Here are my outputs from successive runs of rjb.test (the robust Jarque Bera 
from the lawstat package).

Ram disk filling up - File::COPY,"Hi,

I'm trying to copy a couple of DBM files from a disk to a RAM disk, one of the files is 500M the other quite small.

This is on Slackware 10.1.0 using:  This is perl, v5.8.6 built for i486-linux

Whether I use File::Copy or I roll my own copy by reading and writing the file the filesystem fills up... If I use system (cp from to) I don't have a problem.

Before the file is already there and will be overwritten (I've tried deleting it before copy):
	Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
	/dev/rd/0               253871    121344    132527  48% /Dir/dbm

After:
	Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
	/dev/rd/0               253871    253870         1 100% /Dir/dbm

It copies this:

	499661824 2007-06-07 11:30 file.pag

When it is fine it looks like this in the destination:

	499661824 /Dir/dbm/file.pag

Otherwise like this when disk is full:

	173121536 /Dir/dbm/file.pag

As you see, the file is not copied in its entirety but the file system is full ...

In the meantime I'll use system(cp) but I'm curious.

I've tried changing buffer size, binmode and anything else I could tinker with but I always have the file system filling up when reading and writing using Perl or File::Copy

Cheers,

Jerry

Hey ! Looks like exactly the one I was looking for... For info to other 
R-users, it can be found in the 'plotrix' package. Meanwhile I had 
dropped some line codes with the same target, still  not fully achieved 
(the argument center is not taken into account yet... needs one line more).

Thanks a lot!

Re: [R] Running an R script without running R,"Alberto,

Below I have two scripts:

(1) cpc2fgroup
(2) R.cpc.6_10day.outlook.batch

Bash shell script (1) calls the R script (2). (1) also sets some 
environment variables for (2). I make no claims that this is good coding 
and I might write things a little differently now (rather than a few 
years ago), but it works Also, there are some things going on with 
GRASS GIS that probably has no relevance to your needs, but I also read 
data from GRASS GIS and have to set some environment variables for it too,

I hope this helps and is not confusing.

Regards,
Tom

re : portland,"hello hello !
i was so worried that i had said something in my last e - mail to make you say
"" whoah ! ! ! what was brendan thinking ? "" so when brendan came in as my patient
for a follow - up , i told him "" nope your friend didn ' t e - mail me . . . nope i
haven ' t heard from him . "" i actually was sort of embarrassed . i told
brendan , "" i worked like 92 hours that week and was e - mailing people to stay
awake . he may have been one of those early morning e - mail ' s . i don ' t
remember saying anything too bad ? ? ? "" but hey i was working a ton ! people
get a little odd !
he ' s like "" well why didn ' t you e - mail me to tell me that ? bill is just like
that sometimes . i ' ll give him a call about it . "" actually i didn ' t plan on
hearing from you , but i ' m gald i did . there ' s only one slight
problem . . . because i didn ' t hear from you , the only day i have free and it ' s
actually a night is july 3 rd after like 3 pm then i leave back to nm at 5 : 54
am on the fourth . now you may already have plans for this night if so no
worries .
i need to find a hotel close to the airport for that night with a shuttle
service . if you know of any that would be a great help ! after our first
e - mail experience i ' m assuming it might be easier to call you than to e - mail
you . so . . . i will talk to you soon unless you e - mail me first .
i actually just got home from california and am absolutely exhausted ! so i
will write more or call you later on this week ! i also apoligize for not
having a spell check on my e - mail . my fingers sometimes get away from me
and i don ' t always proof read !
i will be in touch soon ! : )

subject : re : resume
vince ,
he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background ( and then some credit exposure calculation ) with not much credit data analysis experience . i do not think he would be appropriate for bryan ' s group - - he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data , and although this guy may be good at modeling , we already have iris and amitava doing the modeling and looking at data . at this stage , i would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis ( banking , rating agency ) . i am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience , then amitava will find himself with two people ( iris being the other one ) who are both inexperienced in this area , and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway .
if you want to pursue him , we should probably do a phone interview first .

subject : fw : crm database
as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 .
the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero .
there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free !
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : crm database
on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information .
the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities :
1 . account & contact management
2 . activity tracking & planning
3 . potential deal management
4 . outlook synchronization
5 . remote connectivity / synchronization
6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity
the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system :
industrial mkts freight mkts
users 175 45
counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000
contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000
activities 1 , 200 900
quotes 150
opportunities 361 11
the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented :
eol
global mkts
ees
transportation
east power orig
insolvent debt
some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) .
the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups .
colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side .
thanks ,

Well, if you are not going to have an /x- prefix, then you will need to 
register the MIME type with IANA.

I don't believe it's complicated - it's just forms to fill in.

Only x-, in fact. So xo-bundle is actually safe. I suppose it's possible 
people might get confused about its status, but what bad consequences 
could come from such confusion?

Set up env variables on Linux,"Hi All,

I'm pretty new to Perl. I was trying to write up a perl script that
can help set up my working env, for example, once log into Linux
server, run the perl script, it'll move to another folder and
configure some env variables.

I tried using
`cd dest_folder`                       or
system ""cd dest_folder""           or
exec ""cd dest_folder""

but after running script, the current folder doesn't change at all.
Anyone please shed some lights on this.

New Revision: 23183

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=23183

Log:
Check in a change made by Tridge:

This replaces the internal explicit dev/ino file id representation by a
""struct file_id"". This is necessary as cluster file systems and NFS
don't necessarily assign the same device number to the shared file
system. With this structure in place we can now easily add different
schemes to map a file to a unique 64-bit device node.

Jeremy, you might note that I did not change the external interface of
smb_share_modes.c.

It is up to us to decide what will be available and how easy. Currently
the default filter is set to ""open source software only"". So the user
doesn't even see the propriatary packages. You have to change the filter
to ""all software"" before.

Julian Adres Klode works on getting the basic app-data from the Debian
repository. He can easily add manual virtual applications: flash,
codecs, etc.

The codec/plugin installation would require some patching of other
applications. The gstreamer part should be integrated upstream already,
so that it allows to launch a generic codec installer. But I don't know
about firefox, asac, would be the person to talk to.

I cannot provide any numbers to you. AFAIK the missing dvd menu support
is still the greatest disadvantage of gstreamer. Totem switched to
gstreamer as the default recently: 
http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/totem?view=revision&revision=3725

And gstreamer has support for the codec installer :)

Re: [R] http proxies: setting and unsetting,"Hi Gabor,

Thanks for the reply and link.

I took a look at the link -- one thing I don't understand is why if I delete the 'http_proxy' variable via the cmd shell (or equivalent OS dialog box), why I can get R to ignore the proxy, but using Sys.setenv(""http_proxy""="""") won't do that for me (at least for the scope of the session).  If there were other variables affecting it, I would think my deleting 'http_proxy' in the OS would also have no effect -- yet it does.

Any ideas?

Thanks again,
Matt

Note that Windows XP has 4 types of environment variables and I suspect
that the problem stems from not taking that into account:

I have, for work, a User environment variable ""http_proxy"" which I set in the OS (Windows XP Pro).  When I am at work, and I try to retrieve data from the web with 'read.csv', things work just fine.  I assume it knows how to use the proxy.

with respect and humility , we are writing this letter to solicit for your assistance ; though it looks strange hence we don ' t know each other . my name is dr . zakius richard , chief accountant under the ministry of finance republic of south africa . we wish to express our willingness to
transfer an overdue contract sum of us $ 11 m to your company ' s account , through the reserve bank of south africa .
subject : after due consideration , we have fully agreed to privately contact you for this transaction . we are intending to retire from government services to private business we decided to contact you for an urgent business proposal . we have decided to deal with a neutral person like
you because of the nature of the transaction as i will equally be happy to arrange with you on terms of trade and possible transfer of the funds needed for the investment into your company ' s account or personal account .
the ministry of natural resources incurred these funds as a kick back lifting of gold product . this was a ground plot by some of the key staffs of this ministry for their selfish interest . it was so unfortunate that they were removed from office resulting from the change of government and policies , which did not favor their continuous stay in the office . this money $ 11 m ( eleven million us dollar ) is now floating in the ministry of finance as a redundant fund waiting to be claimed . because of our new government policy on civil servants , we are not allowed to own a company or operate a foreign bank account . hence my soliciting for
your assistance to enable us receives this fund into your company ' s
account or personal account .
to enable us start the process and remittance of this funds into your bank account successfully within 10 banking days , we need the following information from you ;
beneficiary full names .
beneficiary address .
private telephone & fax number .
your bank particulars including your bank name , address and your
account number .
note that as soon as we receive this information it will be forwarded to the appropriate quarters for final processing and approvals . with the modalities we have worked out , it makes it possible for you to act as a contractor who worked under my ministry and now waiting to receive his payment and when satisfied by the agencies your bank account will be
credited within 48 banking hours . this transfer is 100 % risk free and hitch - free having done all the underground works locally for the smooth transfer of the funds into your bank account within the shortest period . we advised that you should keep this transaction a top secret and rest all correspondence to fax , and phone only , because we are occupying a sensitive position in the government circle and also this is once in a lifetime opportunity .
finally , we want you to assure us that you will work on our instruction and our own share of the money will be safe . you will be rewarded with 25 % of the total sum for your honest assistance and co - operation , 5 % for any expenses that may come up during the transfer while 70 % remain
for me and my colleagues involved in this transaction .
contact me by return call / fax for any question and further discussion .
awaiting your immediate response .

one of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a senior analyst or third year analyst . it is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase . in no way do i want to imply greed , or that i will only stay for money , but if in your opinion i may be deserving of this , then maybe we could run it by bob or the program , or whoever is in control of that .

please reply to :
crp _ ng 2005 @ yahoo . com
ifax : 15094618096
attn : the president / ceo
from : dr . frank aluko
dear sir ,
i would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and
success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained
in this letter .
before going into details of my proposal to you , i must first implore
you to treat with the utmost confidentiality as this is required for
its success and to have faith in this transaction , for opportunities
like this only comes to one once in a life time .
my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of
my country ' s contracts review panel ( crp ) who are interested in
diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of
the apex bank of my country . in order to commence this transaction , we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated
account the said floating funds . we are determined to conclude the
transfer before the end of this quarter of 2005 .
the source of the funds are as follows : during the last military regime
in my country , government officials set up companies and awarded
themselves contracts that were grossly over - invoiced in various
ministries and parastatals . the present civilian government set up the
contract review panel , which has the mandate to use the instruments of
payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel , to
review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed
outstanding amounts .
my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds
which are presently floating in our ( apex ) central bank ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes .
however , by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of
this panel , we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names
of companies that are based in my country .
i have therefore been mandated , as a matter of trust by my colleagues in
the panel , to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account
we can transfer the sum of u . s . $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( twenty million , five
hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) . that is why i am seeking your
assistance . we have agreed to share the money to be transferred into
your account , if you agree with our proposition as follows ;
( i ) 25 % to the account owner ( you ) .
( ii ) 65 or us ( the panel officials ) .
( iii ) 10 % to be used in settling all expenses ( by both you and us )
incidental to the actualization of this project .
we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to
have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home . please
note that this transaction is 100 % safe and risk - free .
we intend to effect the transfer within fourteen ( 14 ) banking days from
the date of receipt of the following information through the ifax
number stated above : your company ' s name , address , telephone and fax
numbers we will use your company ' s name to apply for the payment and
backdate the award of the contract in favour of your company .
we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we
solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction .
i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when
i hear from you .
please get in touch through my ifax # 15094618096 . or my alternative
email address : crp _ ng 2005 @ yahoo . com

abb meeting,"louise :
you requested that i give you a list of things to avoid discussion with abb . we ' ve maintained a reasonably open relationship with abb up to this point , but here are some ( fairly obvious ) things that we should probably steer clear of :
1 . no discussion about fronterra ;
2 . no specifics about the deacero contract , e . g . extension date , cp ' s , etc ; and
3 . no discussion about project credit issues or financing alternatives for the project .
when this abb contingent was here last ( feb 2001 ) , dave and janet essentially indicated that this was an important project to enron , that we were entirely committed to seeing it through and that if it weren ' t for the damn cfe , we ' d already be done , etc . etc . i think if we stick to that line , we ' ll be fine .
if i think of anything else , i ' ll let you know asap .

enrononline documents,"this email contains the old pa and eta versions . new versions are being drafted .
louise ,
as discussed , there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new buyer as soon as possible , in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of enrononline ( netcoonline ) without delay .
two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the password application ( pa ) and electronic trading agreement ( eta ) , which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on netcoonline .
following is a brief description of the enrononline contractual framework and copies of the proposed eta and pa , which have been revised from the initial enrononline versions to reflect experience of the last two years .
contracts structure
there are three key documents that create the contractual environment for netcoonline : the ' password application ' ( pa ) , the ' electronic trading agreement ' ( eta ) and the commodity contracts in the form of ' general terms and conditions ' ( gtcs ) ( or , alternatively , a master agreement ) . the pa is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer . the other documents are accepted online .
password application ( pa )
the pa is a one - page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty ( as opposed to any of the other documents , which are accepted online by clicking acceptance ) . the pa is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the eta and the gtcs .
the pa , signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company , and approved by netco , allows the customer to obtain a master user id . the master user will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his / her company and administer their access to various products in netcoonline .
we will send copies of the pa to likely customers of netcoonline before we launch the site . the document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch . customers will specify their initial password in the pa and must change it in the first log - in session . upon receipt of signed pa , netco will under normal circumstances enable the master user passwords within 24 hours for pre - approved customers . for counterparties with whom we are not familiar , more time is needed to run credit , legal , contracts , regulatory and tax check .
electronic trading agreement ( eta )
the eta binds counterparties to completed transactions through netcoonline . when the counterparty accesses netcoonline for the first time , he / she will be prompted to read and accept the eta in order to proceed . the eta states that all trades done via netcoonline will be governed by the general terms and conditions ( gtcs ) posted online for a particular product , unless there is a master or any other agreement between netco and the counterparty in place .
general terms and conditions ( gtc )
when a customer offers to transact in a product type for the first time , he / she will be presented with the relevant gtc . the gtc ' s are similar to a streamlined master agreement , in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity . gtc ' s identify termination rights , provisions for security ( as appropriate ) , operational conventions ( nominations , etc . ) , payment periods , tax treatments , force majeure , penalties for non - performance , etc .
customers must accept the terms of the relevant gtc online in order to proceed with a transaction , unless the company has a master agreement in place with netco . only one acceptance of gtc per product type per company is required . if there is a valid master agreement , then the system will not display the gtc , and the master agreement will apply .

electronic trading agreement :",0

First, don't email me directly if you're also sending it to beginners@perl.org.

Second, if you've been ""repeating it"", it's more and more likely that people
are now ignoring you, even if you change your post.

Third, if you aren't able to understand the help you're getting, and that's
why you're ""repeating it"", then it might be time to go hire someone instead of
trying to do it yourself.

I did not look at the rest of your post.

Isn't the idea with allowing numbers here to allow a numeric UID/GID to
be specified without any lookup penalty.

There is the inherent conflict with numeric usernames, but having the
lookup go first seems the wrong way around.

Then you do not want to import it.If you already have
an R.object then you'e done. It is already 'imported.
You just need to work with it, probaly as a data.frame

Do an ls() and find out what objects you have. If you
have a Japan then you can do Japan$LPD or Japan[,1] or
an attach(Japan) and then refer to LPD.  Each approach
has its advantages. 

See http://www.r-project.org/ for some basic
information on the subject.

subject : associates prc meeting - to be rescheduled
today ' s associates prc meeting that was to begin at 1 : 30 has been cancelled
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined . both the morning
analyst prc meeting and the associates prc meeting were scheduled for the
same location and with joe sutton as chair . the analysts prc meeting is
apparently running very long , so someone from the program office called to
cancel the associates prc meeting for this afternoon . i will let you know as
soon as i know a rescheduled date .
in preparation for today ' s prc meeting , i was able to meet in person with
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities ,
accomplishments and performance . for those that were unavailable for a
meeting , we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to
accomplish the same thing . i also have any materials that you may have
provided to your supervisor for the mid - year review process , as well as
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the pep system .
with this delay in the meeting date , i have the time to ask for a copy of
your resume . the prc process clearly focuses on your performance
specifically from january through june 2000 . however , it would be helpful to
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds . please
e : mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to eb 3015 . a couple of you
have come by my office to meet with me . i would also be happy to put a name
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in
houston . my extension is 35926 .",0

Re: getting rid of mkproto.sh from Samba3,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Tridge,

You know I'm going to say this, but I respectfully disagree. :-)

I don't want to start any flame wars on style so this is
all I will say on the subject, but IMO all of your points 
imply that autogenerated headers are better because they
support bad programming habits.  Autogenerated headers are
easier for one programmer to develop but they are harder
for other programmers to use. Proto.h is a compiler workaround.
It does not make Samba development easier for anyone else.

Maybe I'm just immature and don't know any better....
But I will tackle this on my own time, in my own tree and
propose changes when and if I have working code to compare
against the SAMBA_4_0 build/proto system.  For now, this
appears to be a dead issue.

Sorry James.




cheers, jerry

i looked into the proposed tax cut by george w . bush . on his website he
proposes a $ 460 billion tax cut over five years .
the $ 213 billion "" energy tax "" imposed from 1999 to 2001 by higher energy

So, in your opinion, houses are not made using tools and binary packages
are not made using compilers?

I disagree.  I think that it might be debatable if it said 'made from'
but it doesn't.

The meaning of tools doesn't change the meaning of materials.  Overlapping
meanings and different meanings for similar words in different fields
are not that unusual in English.

Referencing a near-century-old US dictionary while suggesting that an
Englishman is wrong about English usage won't win my friendship.
(FWIW, the dictionary seems accurate as written in this case, but
beside the point here and not supporting the claim above.)

Probably a good idea and a good idea for the improvement not to mention
'materials' at all.

I'm still worried by the current phrasing - can we tell how this is
interpreted by the licensor?  Can we claim binaries are GPL by clause 6
or does the 'no permission is granted...' style of clause 7 overrule it?

I see that Florian Weimer was also concerned by this phrasing in
http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00220.html
although it wasn't mentioned what package was being discussed.

Any more comments?

This kind of clause is present in many other packages too and is widely

subject : meeting today
hi grant - as anjam has set up a meeting for 9 : 30 your time how about we try
and talk afterwards . originally we said 10 : 00 your
time but i guess that the mg meeting will take longer than half an hour . are
you free around 10 : 30 your time ?
i think some of the communication problems i originally had with anjam have
been resolved ( although it was a difficult situation to interpret ) however , i
would very much like to discuss the situation that i am in concerning my
immediate management .
i have felt that over the last month i have been floundering a little and
have not really been able to turn to anyone in london for direction
concerning var ( although as expected steve has been very helpful to give me
an idea on how to proceed theoretically ) . i do have many of my own ideas
although i think i need to obtain some kind of authority to start any
substantial work . at the moment i feel like i am doing a lot of small things
and am worried that at some stage someone is going to ask the question -
what exactly does she do over there in research ? ? ?
i have talked to rodrigo lamas ( rac model validation new hire ) and he has
helped me to focus on some points i had already made .
as a quick summary i have drawn up a memo which outlines some of the points i
think need to be addressed as far as the var model is concerned ( i could do a
similar memo for the credit reserve model but to start have focused my
comments on market risk ) .
it is a bit rough and ready ( pls excuse any appalling spelling mistakes ! ) but
i think it will help you to see what i have been thinking about since i have
been here .
i do think that the most important issue is that concerning the origin of the
vol / price curves and how they are constructed .

According to our file, our version in 2.7.2.  The current free version is
2.8.3.  Obviously, if we need to keep this file, we should get up to the 
most recent version.  I wouldn't however, mess with it much to make it 
pass coding standards, since that would make it much more difficult to 
patch to keep up to date with the original.

[R]  how to preserve trained model in LDA?,"Hi all:

               I'm developing an application in which I use standard data to
train the model in LDA and use the trained model to predict on test data. I
can't train the model every time when I do prediction. So I need to save the
trained model onto disk after the first training. Does anybody have idea
about this? You help is highly appreciated. 

 

Best Regards

re : default rates,"mark , this is a good point . in moody ' s june 1999 study , debt recoveries for
corporate bankruptcies , there is a graph of firm - level recovery rates by year
of bankruptcy resolution ( as opposed to default year ) . reading from the
graph finds :
as the data above is based on resolution year , the same study finds the
average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1 . 30 years ( median 1 . 15 years
and standard deviation of 1 . 20 years ) . the interesting point is the slide in
recovery value 1996 to 1998 . one would wonder if the mix of high - yield
issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries
( quick technological obsolescence - - little tangible recovery value ) .
interesting to note is the december 1999 to december 2000 change in spreads .
the table below divides the december 2000 spreads by the december 1999
spreads . one would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this
time - frame , but the figures are more mixed :

cc :
subject : default rates
please see below for my note to jeremy at the bottom and his reponse . i
have placed mark ruane ' s yields against a mid november default frequency
table . note there may be a slight shearing in dates , but the concept is
more important :
market implied cumulative default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 51 5 . 74 14 . 54
aa 0 . 67 6 . 39 16 . 61
a 0 . 98 8 . 98 21 . 03
bbb 1 . 17 9 . 88 22 . 39
bb 3 . 27 18 . 62 37 . 51
b 4 . 65 24 . 21 46 . 27
s & p historical default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 00 0 . 13 0 . 67
aa 0 . 01 0 . 33 0 . 90
a 0 . 04 0 . 47 1 . 48
bbb 0 . 21 1 . 81 3 . 63
bb 0 . 91 8 . 82 14 . 42
b 5 . 16 20 . 95 27 . 13
in looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how
many more defaults occur in a recession ( 1991 ) versus average ( 1981 - 1999 )
historical default rates ( % ) :
investment grade non - investment
grade
avg . 1981 - 99 0 . 07 4 . 21
1991
0 . 12 10 . 40
multiple 1 . 7 x
2 . 5 x
looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals
default rates to obtain a "" multiple "" ( how much more severe than historical ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa infinite 44 . 2 x 21 . 7 x
aa 67 . 0 x 19 . 4 x 18 . 5 x
a 24 . 5 x 19 . 1 x 14 . 2 x
bbb 5 . 6 x 5 . 5 x 6 . 2 x
bb 3 . 6 x 2 . 1 x 2 . 6 x
b 1 . 1 x 1 . 2 x 1 . 7 x
on the 10 year historical figures , we need to be careful as the s & p static
pool figures show a definite seasoning ( lower defaults in late years probably
due to prepayment ) versus our contracts . secondly , the s & p figures have
withdrawn ratings , which usually mean they are stale , but loosing some
information content .
i will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further .

That depends heavily upon which shell you are using, but in general
you should be able to say

perl script.pl > logfile.txt

Note, If the script writes to stdout and to stderr you may need to say

perl script.pl > stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt

"Re: svn commit: samba r22539 - in branches:
 SAMBA_3_0/source/lib/talloc
 SAMBA_3_0_25/source/lib/talloc SAMBA_4_0/source/lib/talloc","> can you also update the documentation?
 > lib/talloc/talloc.3.xml and lib/talloc/talloc_guide.txt

NO!!!!!

talloc checking for 'zero' as special is totally bogus. Please don't
waste time updating the docs, or updating talloc. Please also remove
it from the samba4 talloc.

Jeremy, if you want a special wrapper for Samba3, then please create
your own lib/util_talloc.c and put the wrapper there. Better still,
think some more and I think you will realise that returning a valid
pointer for a zero length talloc is _correct_. This is even more the
case for talloc() than it is for malloc(), as for talloc the context
matters, so it is a quite valid and useful pattern to create an
initially zero length piece of memory and expand it later (as was done
in Samba3 and which was broken by your change).

I haven't looked at the bug that triggered this thread, but I'm
willing to bet the bug was not truly caused by talloc returning a
pointer on zero length, but instead by a routine not validating its
inputs for the constraints of the routine, and now you've put in code
to use talloc as a crutch for incorrect parameter checking.

Get this out of talloc.c and talloc.h please. The _strict() idea is
bogus. The ""strictly correct"" behaviour is exactly what talloc already
did. This was no accident in the design of talloc - it is exactly as
it was designed to behave.

  Dont think it can be done - if you look at the code for 'scan', it 
disappears off into internal() calls to do the business of finding and 
reading a file, so you're going to have trouble changing its behaviour 
in R. You'd have to patch R's C source to implement a search path.

Looking at PDD15, I see this paragraph...

 > declaration of the method, or pass a named parameter ""vtable"" into  
the
 > add_method method on a class or role.

... which is kind of lonely, since, as you point out, there is no way  
in PDD15 to *declare* a method (and not that vtable ISA method, either.)

If we're keeping :vtable, we need to update this verbiage (and  
include an example) to avoid confusion.

On a related note, :method is mentioned in docs/compiler_faq.pod &  
docs/imcc/calling_conventions.pod. If it's dead, it needs to be  
deprecated; if it's not, it should probably be mentioned in PDD15.

No, but as far as I am aware, neither she nor anyone representing her

You're right. I used to be very opposed to Perl 6. Now understand that it has 
some nice improvements over Perl 5, but still find looking at its code to be 
quite a bit of a future shock. ""Perl 6 is a nice language. Too bad it's not 
Perl."" ;-)

Well hopefully you would be able to call Rindolf code from Perl 6 code and 
vice versa. Also see:

http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/ideas/#tucan

For a different approach for creating a cross-language interaction layer. I 
admit that I haven't started working on it yet.

Well, I prefer a ""Do and let do"" and (less preferably) a ""Complain and let 
complain"" approach than a hurt calcalution. Some people found value in Perl 
6, and Audreyt actually created an implementation that sort-of-works. People 
are also having fun working on Parrot and other related projects. As you 
know, perl5 (the C-based implementation) has also not been completely 
neglected, and its hackers are doing fine.

This reminds me of the standard ""isn't there a better way to spend the time 
working on Porting to MS Windows"" myth. If there are people who are willing 
to do something FOSSy, then it is worth doing.

Thanks!

Like I said - no promises. Maybe I'll get to hacking on punie - maybe I won't. 
The day is short, and I have a lot of work to do.

Hmmm.... I haven't been closely following Parrot.

As I said, I'm sending it to p6-language and p6-internals instead.

Slim down and boost your self esteem,"Weight is a major problem everywhere.  Many people battle the bulge every day and hope that they will find a diet that works for them.  However, you don't need a fad diet to lose weight.  You don't need expensive gym memberships either.  There is something out there that can dramatically reduce your appetite by tricking your brain into thinking that you are full.

http://www.ykufuyfua.com/

People eat for lots of different reasons, hunger isn't the only one.  There are many reasons why people resort to food as a comforter but old habits die hard.  What if I were to tell you that there is a simple way to lose weight?  A way that, the television favourite, Oprah herself claims to work!  Want to know what she recommends?

http://www.ykufuyfua.com/

Cosmetic surgeries and diets are quick and easy ways out but they also have side effects that can't be avoided, not only that but the bills from surgeries are astronomical!  Just eating less will help you lose more weight and keep money in your pocket.  Harder said than done?  Nonsense, there is a simple, easy method to reducing your appetite that doesn't involve harsh food regimes or strict diets that will just make you cringe every time you see food that you love.  If you want to eat what you always eat but still lose weight and feel great then click below.

case study guidelines
1 . model should be for a particular market . examples : pjm , chicago , ecar ,
southern california . lb ( optional ) . model should be for a particular purpose . examples : valuing a
new combustion turbine at the florida / georgia border , bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in nepool , valuing a retail portfolio in
pennsylvania .
2 . model should be estimated on a particular data set . examples : daily nymex
close prices for palo verde , pjm hourly spot prices for 1998 - 1999 .
3 . case study should describe several candidate models , for volatility
and / or market price , that were considered . case study should discuss why
these models were considered . candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally .
4 . evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified , and quantified to the extent possible . examples of evaluation
criteria : residuals that are not autorcorrelated , stationarity , r - squared ,
akaike information criterion .
5 . parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed . the
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described .
6 . some diagnostics of model fit ( vis - a - vis data set ) should be presented .
7 . if possible , predictive power of model should be assessed .
generally , the case study should include all of the items above . the case

This broke the build of the samba3sam code.  You should have some mail
in your inbox :-).  Now, that code needs some work, but it remains one
of the few tests of the more elaborate parts of ldb_map.

Do you think it would take longer to learn the basics of Perl 
necessary for that script than it took to reimplement the hundred 
lines of well performing Perl as a thousand lines of slow Java?

Visit the boss, show him the two programs printed out (so that he can 
compare the length ... that's I guess about all he can understand), 
tell him how long did each of them take to write and how long does 
each take to process the file and then ask him whether he's really 
sure that it's more efficient to waste time with Java or to teach one 
more guy some Perl.

Eager? I'd expect them to forget about trying to make it quicker 
because they know the've failed to compete many times already and 
concentrate on the reasons why Perl should be banned instead.

Strange, usually people want multiple y axes.

Maybe you could look at setting 4 panels for plotting e.g.

par(mfrow=c(2,2))

before doing your actual plot. 

If you insist on plotting 4 lines with 4 x axes into one plot then you 
need to make some adjustment prior plotting. You shall scale sal, temp, 
obs and fluo into some comparable figures e.g. to 0-1 and after plotting 
you need to add 4 axes with correct numbers (see at parameter). Adding 2 x 
axes (top and bottom) is strightforward, however adding next 2 x axes 
seems to be tricky (you probably need to use combination of lines and 
segments).

Re: [R] Excel calling R functions,"Thanks to Marc, Duncan, Tobias, Alberto. I'm aware of rcom and have in fact downloaded it somewhere. But unfortunately it won't work for me as I'm in a corporate environment and don't have admin rights to set up the R(D)COM (background) server. If there is a way to work around it, pls let me know.

And just for completeness for the thread,
there is the RDCOMServer package which has
a more general mechanism for making R
functionality available to other applications
that does not require writing R commands
but uses the language independent spirit of
DCOM.  And it also allows event handlers
for things like Excel actions to be written as R functions

i work for the market risk rac london group . i review the quantitative issues
arising from enron europe models .
i am in this function given my background ( phd from imperial college - london )
and also due to my past experience
as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and louis dreyfus .
my agenda includes the review of a number of deals ( wessex , tpl , eastern ,
. . . ) , as well as the
review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their
respective volatility curves .
currently i am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the uk gas market ,
its respective
price curve and term structure of volatility .
bjorn and david suggested it could be very productive if i had the chance to
meet you and your team
to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools .
i will be in houston from the 10 th to 15 th september . i wonder if you could
book some time for me in
your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same .

re : transfers to netco,"information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to ( i ) confidentiality provisions with counterparties and ( ii ) with respect to power , the need for ferc approval . everyone seems to be comfortable that the identity of counterparties can be disclosed , as well as the counterparties contact information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular counterparty . consequently , the software going to netco will be cleansed of the trade data and individual ' s data bases and files should be similarly cleansed .

the recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to netco employees obtaining access to them . further , the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating . i do not know if not telling people is fair . however , absent some other solution , it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable . would you be the person to instruct the it people to delete and / or announce to "" to be netco "" employees that this will occur ?

 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

re : hiring practices for summer interns,"sally ,
thanks for the email and update . i agree that we must do something quickly
to resolve this . i believe that you should interview for summer interns as
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip . i know you were very
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at ou that
you got last year ( i was surprised and the school was thrilled that you
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation ) . we cant lose that
momentum . i am sure that each school ' s program is different and that most
don ' t interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what i
have learned about the ou schedule , we will lose all the top candidates if we
wait . i am sure that is not what charlene and celeste were trying to
accomplish with their guidelines .
please keep me up informed on this matter .
thanks and good luck with the students .

subject : hiring practices for summer interns
while recruiting on campus recently i became aware that a decision was made
at the program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns . in
talking with students and faculty at the university of texas and university
of oklahoma , it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an
internship with enron , as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for
summer 2001 interns . i have communicated my concerns to lexi elliott and her
manager , shelley jones , and was told by both that the decision to delay
interviews for summer interns was made at a program level based on enron ' s
staffing . when i asked about the competitive data available regarding the
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews , i was even more
concerned to discover that neither lexi nor shelley had that data . it would
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for
enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for
our analyst and associates programs .
i have had conversations over the last two weeks with lexi and shelley , with
no resolution . when they could not provide the competitive data to either
confirm or eliminate my concerns , i volunteered to have james scribner , a
senior director on my team , obtain this market information . lexi and shelley
either did not have the time to gather this data , or were not sure how to do
so . they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this
critical information . i now have information at hand with regard to firms
that will be recruiting at ut and ou this fall for summer intern positions .
and based on this information , i believe that enron is at risk for not hiring
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for
these positions this fall .
while my research only touches on two of the schools at which enron recruits ,
i want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many , if not all
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting . as administrators of the
program , you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to
carry the enron message to campus . i believe that we also have an obligation
to make this a two - way messaging system . i strongly believe that we must
address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly , as teams will be on
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days . i
suspect that many enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of
the program ' s decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer
internships . in working with rick causey and mike mcconnell , executive
sponsors for ut and ou , respectively , they are as concerned as i about the
decision on interviewing summer interns . i have copied both of them on this
note to the two of you .
please let me know how this can be resolved . with the help of james scribner
and others , we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that
should be targeted for summer internships . i will offer as much of my time
as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative
ways to turn this around .",0

hdf5save is a function in the hdf5 contributed package, so you should 
start with its maintainer, Marcus G. Daniels .  But 
before you bother him, make sure you're using the latest release of it. 
  If you still have problems, give him the usual details requested in
the posting guide.

dearest in the lord .
i am the above name person from the republic of senegal . i am married to
dr alfred williams who worked with senegalise embassy in south africa for
nine years before he died in the year 2000 . we were married for eleven years
without a child . he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days . before his death we were both born again christians and we lived happilly .
when my late husband was alive he secured $ 15 million ( fifteen million u . s .
dollars ) with financial institution here in cote d ' ivoire . presently , this
money is still with the financial institution . but recently , my doctor told
me that from all the test conducted on my health , i am not going to last
long , expecially , due to my cancer and stroke . but what disturbs me most
now is stroke . this have indeed put me into serious confussion .
having known my condition , i decided to donate this fund to churches or
christian organization that will utilize this money specifically for the
work of god . i want a church or individual that will use this money to
fund churches , orphanages , widows , and the less priviledged ones . also ,
the propagation of the work of god , building and maintaining the house of
god through this money , is very important .
the bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth . i
took this bold decision because i don ' t have any child that will inherit
this money and my late husband relatives are not christians . i don ' t want
my husband ' s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers , for their own
selfish interest and in an ungodly manner . i am not afraid of death hence
i know where i am going . i know that i am going to be in the bossom of the
lord . exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall
hold my peace .
i am presently in one hospital here in abidjan called ( apex medical centre )
receiving some treatment .
as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of the financial
institution in ivory coast . i will also give you all information regarding
the deposit of this money . i will also issue you a letter of authority that
will empower you as the original - beneficiary of this fund . i want you and
your church to always pray for me because god work in misterious ways . my
happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy christian . who ever that wants
to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and truth . i will also want you
to speak with me through the hospital telephone number which i will give
to you as soon as i hear from you . please always be prayerful all through
your life .
any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian
individual for this same purpose . please assure me that you will act accordingly
as i stated herein . hoping to hear from you soon . please reply me through

remain blessed in the name of the lord .
yours in christ ,

[R] Left/right hand side characters,"Hello all

Is there a way reducing the number of characters in a list so that just
the left n numbers of characters is given?

For example, If I have a list, listnames, which consists of 4 strings of
6 characters;

 

>listnames

[1] ""item12"" ""item34"" ""item56"" ""item78""

 

Is there a way to reduce this so only the 5 characters on the lefthand
side are given (similar to the LEFT function in Excel)

 

So that I'd get a list like this

 

>listnames

[1] ""item1"" ""item3"" ""item5"" ""item7""

 

Thanks

Tony

re: hello,"flash and pdf both now are owned by adobe.  If I'm not much mistaken 
Section 508 compliance requires that java may not be used in any 
user-visible fashion on web sites but may be used for house-cleaning 
chores behind the scenes.  As I understand it, java is just too immature 
to be on the Internet at all.  From a security perspective it offers way 
too many opportunities to the kind of people that otherwise trash 
perfectly reasonable neighborhoods and java can't adequately defend 
itself.

text mode: Line endings are translated to/from Perl's end-of-line
character ""\n"" to the host operating system's end-of-line character
(CRLF for DOS based machines, LF for UNIX based machines, etc.)

binary mode (aka raw): No translations are made.  Characters/bytes are
written directly to the file.

encryption: A method of making data (hopeful) unreadable, but
recoverable, using an algorithm.  The output can be either binary or
text depending on the algorithm.

Do you want to compare two binary files to see if they have the same contents?

[R] minor bug in lmer,"While playing around with the ""(1|Subj)"" syntax in lmer [lme4], I tried 
out ""(0|Subj)"". It turns out that this is such a naughty thing to do 
that it crashes the GUI in Windows! The parallel structure in lme [nlme] 
has no effect. Try the following code to see for yourself.

# Make data set
  q = 5; n = 5
  Subj = NULL
  X = NULL
  Y = NULL
  for (i in 1:q) {
   for (j in 1:n) {
    Subj = c(Subj,i)
    X = c(X,j)
    Y = c(Y,i/j)
   }
  }
  fake = data.frame(Subj,X,Y)

# nlme
  library(nlme)
  fake.g.1 = groupedData(Y~1|Subj, data = fake)
  fake.g.lme.1.1 = lme(Y ~ X, random=~1|Subj, data= fake.g.1)

  fake.g.0 = groupedData(Y~0|Subj, data = fake)
  fake.g.lme.0.0 = lme(Y ~ X, random=~0|Subj, data= fake.g.0)

  fake.g.lme.1.0 = lme(Y ~ X, random=~1|Subj, data= fake.g.0)
  fake.g.lme.0.1 = lme(Y ~ X, random=~0|Subj, data= fake.g.1)

  # The following are all identical
  summary(fake.g.lme.1.1)
  summary(fake.g.lme.0.0)
  summary(fake.g.lme.1.0)
  summary(fake.g.lme.0.1)

# lme4
  library(lme4)

  # Same analysis as above:
  fake.lme.1 = lmer(Y ~ X + (1|Subj),data=fake)

  # The following line crashes the WinR GUI!
  fake.lme.0 = lmer(Y ~ X + (0|Subj),data=fake)

creating customer finals,"bill ,
with the new system , we need to rework the timelines of some jobs that pull data in . the creation of customer finals must take place prior to our pulling in the schedules to create our estimates . i am requesting that you implement a 3 : 00 am deadline for customer finals to be created . we will run our job at that time that pulls in schedules . if the customer finals are not created by 3 : 00 , then our job will be run again at 5 : 00 am . we understand that there are special circumstances that arise and we can deal with those on a case - by - case basis . this is vital for us to have the finals created in this timeline and makes our lives much easier !

following up on this morning ' s meeting with louise and joe deffner on the requested ammendments , we went through the list of issues sent by tod 9 / 17 , and kevin ' s subsequent response .
as both kevin and louise stated , the first issue , the clarification on banking , is a confirmation of the "" intent of the deal "" . as you remember , the project ' s ability to bank recs and energy , and to carry that bank forward , is the intent of the deal . we need your recognition that this is the case so that we can go forward with this clarification ammendment .
we hope to keep this moving in your absense and appreciate your cooperation on this point . please give me a call , or at a minimum , please share your perspective with louise on this issue so that we can keep the financing moving forward .

enron announcement,"car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing
provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value
proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first
choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract
reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and
low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national ,
where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or
canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate
selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or
collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for
any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle .
for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000
per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *
these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following
contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded
on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s
preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in
national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club
membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid
return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron
travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron
american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on
the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .

[R] Function tsmooth,"Hi,

Assume that we may model the Nottingham temperature data (nottem) or Sunspot 
data (sunspot) set by a nonparametric autoregressive model of the form
                               Yt = m(Yt-1) + et.

Using the kernel estimation method, produce the resulting plots. We may use 
the fucntion
tsmooth(x,y,""notmal"",bandwidth=0.01).

How can i define x and y using data nottem and sunspot?

Thanks a lot!

Yes that's right. I don't enforce UNIX caps before accepting
UNIX calls. It's the same way that we accept all CIFS command
codes even if a client negotiates a downlevel dialect.

In order for you to be *sure* that they'll work you must
do the qfsinfo to find out if they're supported, but even
if you don't do that and are talking to a server that supports
them they'll work if you send them.

No, I don't think so. The particular thing in question here
is the parent smbd that needs to exit (!) after being idle
for a while. So we need to tell the difference between
events that would block the parent to exit from events that
are so unimportant that the parent might just exit.

With a general events system that has timed events this is
quite difficult to achieve I think. Thus my suggestion that
the parent might just exit when the number of clients drops
to zero.

BTW, I find the concept that some daemon creates the
listening socket for us quite strange. inetd, that's
something I see, but doing the listen and not do the fork? I
don't know...

I'm not sure I want to go through hoops to adjust to this,
I'd rather accept some inefficiency on that platform by
doing a few more exec(2) calls than strictly necessary.
